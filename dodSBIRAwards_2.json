        "abstract": "To address the Marines need for a miniaturized inertial survey system which can meet or exceed the current Improved Position and Azimuth Determining System (IPADS) performance requirements with significant reductions in form factor and weight, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop the new Miniaturized Enhanced Position and Azimuth Determination (MEPAD) system based on novel complementary blending of state-of-the-art small form factor inertial sensors combined with optimized Kalman filter fusion algorithms. The innovative tightly integrated architecture allows precise and timely Survey Control Point (SCP) azimuth determination and maintaining of position knowledge while traversing a common Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid. In Phase I, POC will develop the proposed MEPAD system architecture and subsystem components requirements. The optimized algorithms will also be developed, modeled, and simulated incorporating the hardware noise specifications to demonstrate the feasibility of MEPAD. POC will provide the details on the hardware\/software required and provide an estimate of the size and weight, and prepare a preliminary plan to develop and evaluate a prototype MEPAD system in Phase II. In Phase II, POC plans to build and evaluate MEPAD against the current IPADS performance specifications. A plan for Phase III transition to the Marine Corps will be developed."

        "abstract": "Accurate surveys of both position and azimuth are critical components of the artillery mission. These requirements must be met in all operational environments, including situations where GPS signals are degraded or denied. Currently, these requirements have been met using the Improved Position and Azimuth Determining System (IPADS). Unfortunately, the IPADS is based on older navigation sensor technology which results in a heavy and power-hungry system and limits the total mission effectiveness of the system. To address this need, we propose to develop a Compact Optimal Multi-Sensor Position and Attitude Survey System (COMPASS). COMPASS is an innovative approach that seamlessly combines state-of-the-art sensors, an optimal robust nonlinear fusion engine, and a modular system architecture which enables us to meet or exceed IPADS performance while greatly improving the system SWAP (under 10 lbs total sensor weight). This order-of-magnitude improvement in SWAP not only enables single-Marine operation, it opens up a new set of use cases, including the possibility for dismounted operations. COMPASS offers Marines a system that is lightweight, intelligent, and mission effective."

        "abstract": "To facilitate assault operations, the Marines need an amphibious vehicle that can quickly move troops and equipment between ships and the shore. However, due to an increased level of sophistication in the anti-ship weapons available to potential adversaries, Navy ships must remain far from shore during assault operations (i.e., many tens of miles). This creates a need for assault vehicles that can achieve high speed in the water. Current displacement hull-based assault vehicles do not provide the desired high-speed capability. The need that is addressed in this proposal is the development of an adaptive hull structure for amphibious assault vehicles that can achieve high speed. We have developed an innovative planing hull concept that also incorporates an adaptive propulsion system that meets the requirements for low-speed operation in shallow water and high-speed operation in deep water when in the planing mode. In Phase I of the project, the Creare team will develop its innovative hull concept by conducting computational fluid analysis and finite element analysis to validate our design concepts. We will also develop hydrodynamic scaled models that will facilitate tow tank testing at the start of Phase II."

The proposed Multi-Functional RF Material System can be tailored to provide low to high dielectric and magnetic properties and low to high electric and magnetic loss, while maintaining the strength and stiffness of a conventional structural composite system. The true multi-functional nature of the material will also result in a system solution that will require less volume and will be lighter compared to current solutions.

The probe shall be capable of measuring defects in both LO treatments and RF apertures and overall vehicle RCS, supporting inspections at both Tier 1 and Tier 2 levels with the same unit. The proposed system is both affordable and supports quick measurements with 3D imaging capability to remove clutter such as landing gear or other below-deck obstructions via post-processing. Whether handheld or robotically manipulated, the proposed sensor provides a simple and dynamic measurement capability, virtually eliminating the need for dedicated diagnostic facilities. IERUS will provide the Navy a unique shipboard measurement capability with straightforward extension to off-ship diagnostics as well."

        "abstract": "Current and, more importantly due to increasing threat capabilities, future US Navy (USN) low-observable (LO) aircraft require operational repair and LO performance verification well beyond all other USN airborne assets. Maintaining high-fidelity LO characteristics is particularly challenging in operational environments and even with best maintenance-practices, insidious radar cross section (RCS) hotspots in the aircrafts radar signature can develop and compromise mission lethality as well as aircraft and warfighter survivability. Within this research program, the STAR Dynamics SARBAR handheld, X band, real-time, real-aperture LO imaging radar system design will be optimized and refined to produce ultra-wideband (UWB) high-resolution, two-dimensional (2D), spotlight-radar images on flight and hanger decks providing visualization and recording of 2D images, for unprecedented operational, at-sea LO-verification and survivability assurance. Similarly, surface-to-air LO-verification technologies will be evaluated and design-enhanced for operational implementation, based on STARs existing, demonstrated, and validated, Ground-To-Air RCS System (GTARS) radar tracking\/imaging technology that measures radar LO signatures of aircraft in dynamic, operational airborne environments, generating calibrated radar images to provide maintainers with otherwise unavailable LO-verification data. Lastly, this research effort will provide a baseline design configuration for a compact, affordable UWB airborne LO-verification radar capable of critical, real-time, in-flight GO\/NO-GO LO verification of LO aircraft."

Front-end conditioning and switching arrangements will be developed to accommodate various input voltages including 650-1100 VDC, 6.5 kVDC, and 4160 VAC. DTI will also examine designs to utilize higher voltage MVDC power sources in the 10-20 kVDC range, as described in the PMS 320 Naval Power Systems Technology Development Roadmap. To support a broader range of applications, we will investigate architectures that will allow bi-directional power conversion between battery and capacitor energy storage. As with our previous effort, DTI will design, build, and deliver a power converter unit in Phase II meeting all prototype performance requirements, for integration and testing at Navy Railgun facilities."

        "abstract": "Electromagnetic Railguns (EMRG) require high-voltage supplies to power pulse-forming-networks (PFN) through charging\/discharging of High Voltage (HV) capacitors. Existing high-output-voltage power converters have inadequate power densities for shipboard applications. Additionally, most commercial high-output-voltage converters dont accept input voltages in the range of projected Navy power systems, and arent compatible with the shipboard environment (shock, vibration, etc.) requirements. Navy capacitor charging is very different from commercial applications with higher power levels, continuous operation at high repetition rates, high ramp rates and\/or steep changes in power profile, posing challenges to the prime movers and system stability. RCT Systems will develop an innovative, advanced, high power density silicon carbide (SiC) based, modular and scalable capacitor charging converter capable of charging 325kJ capacitor(s) from zero to 6.5-10kVDC in 5 seconds at repetition rates up to 10 charges per minute. Advanced circuit and control techniques will be used to achieve charging profiles with low peak to average power ratios. Mechanical design aspects for shipboard environment (packaging, thermal, shock, vibration, EMI\/EMC) will be examined. Since multiple chargers are used in the EMRG application, the system design aspects related to the interface with the shipboard Medium Voltage (MV) distribution system will be provided, focused on the 4160VAC case."

        "abstract": "The Navy is currently developing a Pulsed Power System (PPS) to power an Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG). The PPS uses a capacitor bank as the source of the very high current required by the EMRG for operation. EMRG requirements necessitate the use of a high power density (&gt;3MW\/m3) DC\/DC converter capable of a 10 capacitor recharge rate per minute.  This capacitor bank is comprised of 325 kJ capacitor rep-rate modules which must recharge to 10kV from the ships 650-1100 VDC power.   The capacitor bank charger must have a peak-to-average power ratio of no more than 1.1 over the charge cycle.  There are no direct commercial solutions to this capacitor bank charger application.   In this Phase I SBIR we propose to develop a high energy density capacitor charger that has a 3MW\/m3 power density that is accomplished by having SiC based multiple DC-DC converter stages that are initially paralleled then connected in series as the capacitor voltage rises, and to oil fill the charger to minimize the volume required to meet the voltage isolation and corona elimination requirements.    The successful development of this technology will enables the EMRG while reducing the overall size and weight of the weapon system."

Explosives trace detection and classification will be performed by Emitechs novel technology, which involves  smart nanocomposites and multi-parametric electro-optical sensing. We will conduct a feasibility analysis and provide the conceptual design of a compact sensor array for underwater real-time detection and classification of nitro- and peroxide- based explosives. The design of a water-vapor conversion module will be selected and preliminarily tested using simulating breadboards. The number of sensory elements will be determined and the flow cell will be modified accordingly.  Also, with high-level assistance from SubChem Sensor System, Inc. (our subcontractor), all necessary equipment\/software for integration of the sensor array into an ROV platform will be assessed and conceptually designed.        During the 6-months of the Phase I option, we will contribute to the continued progress of the project for a successful transition to Phase II.  This time will be spent initiating the transition from a conceptual design to a fabricated package.      A working prototype will be fabricated, tested and optimized during Phase II project performance."

If successful, the proposed trace chemical\/explosive sensor system will provide improved classification and identification of suspect underwater targets in missions for which acoustic and\/or visual imaging alone are not effective. The envisioned chemical sensor package will be capable of being integrated into a man-portable remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The goal of this project is to expand the existing trace chemical detection capability to include TNT and other nitro-based underwater UXO analytes of interest, such as RDX, PETN and HMX, as well as home-made explosive (HME) compound such as ammonium nitrate, triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD). The current state-of-the-art is a single analyte sensor for detection of TNT, which only partially addresses the Navys requirement to detect the full range of explosive threats.

        "abstract": "The current state-of-the-art for an underwater unexploded ordnance (UUXO) detector is a single analyte sensor for detection of TNT, which only partially addresses the Navys requirement to detect the full range of explosive threats. Because of the low solubility of explosive compounds in water, the concentration of explosives near UUXO is likely to be extremely low. Furthermore, once the explosive compound is released, it rapidly mixes in the surrounding water. Prevailing currents make the explosive concentration highly localized and non-uniform, requiring good sensor time response to avoid averaging out of the plume signal. Furthermore, chemical and biological interferents in the seawater can introduce bias and complicate the analysis. For these reasons, analyzers with superb sensitivity, time-response, and multi-analyte sensitivity are required for this application. Mainstream Engineering proposes a system that is a multi-analyte sensor system to detect explosive threat compounds of interest (both nitro-based and peroxide-based) at operationally relevant concentrations in seawater. In addition, the sensor will be compact, low-power, and ruggedize for a marine environment about an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)."

        "abstract": "Research Proposed: Research is proposed to develop an innovative transfer method and network architecture for autonomously uploading condition based maintenance (CBM) and energy command and control (C2) data to CBM data warehouses. This novel approach will also allow for operation over limited bandwidth links, including real-time visibility of data from remote locations.   Problem Statement: Capturing CBM data in an efficient and timely manner is key to maintaining accurate predictions of vehicle health. Current solutions require manual connection or wireless links with insufficient data transfer rates for the CBM data.  Additionally, they can pose cross-domain data transfer issues and lack of visibility of real-time data over wireless tactical data links.  Plan\/Process Outline: A flexible architecture will be designed for autonomously uploading CBM data over radios including bandwidth-limited and disrupted networks. With approaches in pre-processing, support for limited bandwidth networking, and passive RFID tags for autonomous upload triggering, this architecture will allow for automatic upload in garrison or when forward deployed, and will support real-time presentation of data via a remote dashboard application. Where applicable, cross-domain data diode capability will be used to support transfer of CBM data to other network domains, allowing for communication with secure tactical networks."

Current service discovery protocols are mainly targeted towards fixed wired infrastructure or relatively stable cellular wireless networks.  Many of these protocols create significant traffic overhead, are not scalable in a wireless environment, rely on central infrastructure, or perform badly when connectivity becomes intermittent.

        "abstract": "Superconductor analog-to-digital converters (ADC) offer discriminating advantages in both bandwidth and fidelity due to very high sampling rates and quantum-accurate digitization based on counting of magnetic flux quanta. Multiple digital-RF receiver systems incorporating superconductor ADCs have been in operation for over four years in field-ready configurations at Government laboratories. We propose to develop heavily oversampled lowpass ADCs to deliver extremely high dynamic range in the low-end of the spectrum (20 MHz). This will be accomplished by simultaneously advancing the quantizer resolution and sample rate using newly available advanced fabrication process nodes. In addition, we propose advanced digital signal processing techniques to further improve signal-to-noise ratio. We have created a detailed roadmap for developing ADCs with increasingly higher performance during Phase I (Base and Option) as well as Phase II. Leveraging the strong design infrastructure developed during the last two years, we propose to complete the first new ADC milestone (design, fabrication, and testing) in Phase I Base itself while developing and simulating detailed circuit models for the next milestone, which will be completed in Phase I Option. Also in Phase I, we will refine the digital post-processing algorithms for the improved ADCs using models and measured data."

Derivative sampling would sample the signal and its higher-order derivatives at sub-Nyquist to achieve larger bandwidth and resolution. The sub-Nyquist samples of the signals and its derivatives would then be digitally processed using digital filter-banks to generate the requisite samples at Nyquist rate. The derivative of the signals will be generated by using various order high-pass filters. Thus to achieve the desired performance the proposal would build high-pass filters and ADCs. The proposal will explore 3 different architectures, viz., 1. Semiconductor high-pass filters and semiconductor ADC, 2. Super-conductor high-pass filters and ADC, and 3. Hybrid, i.e., Superconductor high-pass filters and semiconductor ADC. The best of the three architectures would then be designed, fabricated, and tested in the later phases."

Trex Enterprises proposes an Augmented Reality Technology Helmet-Mounted Display (ART-HMD), which includes low-cost components combined with low-latency (&lt; 5msec) electronics for data transmission and overlay of computer generated data with stereo camera imagery, an optically enhanced inertial head tracker and a RF-based precision geolocation system, which provides accuracy of 30cm. The ART-HMD includes a display with field of view (FOV) of 100 degrees, two user-removable and user replaceable low-light EO\/IR sensors and embedded optically-enhanced inertial head tracker with nominal accuracy of three mils. The device attaches to Marine Corp helmet night vision goggle rails. It has a capacity to transmit its video stream to an external device and to receive and display an externally sourced video stream, and to display its camera imagery overlaid with real time imported imagery. Under the Phase-I program, Trex will define system hardware and software requirements; demonstrate optically enhanced inertial head tracker, design and fabricate a brassboard, demonstrate a low-latency video relay, fabricate and demonstrate low-latency electronics, design a Phase II prototype and develop CAD design package."

These training simulations require significant cost and effort to develop. Unfortunately, the lack of evidence-based design guidelines for critical decisions such as fidelity leads to simulations that are developed in an ad hoc manner. This practice risks ineffective training at significant expense. Instead, developers need scientifically validated methods and tools for understanding and choosing the optimum level of fidelity for training simulations. To address this issue, this project will design and demonstrate the feasibility of Simulating Training Results to Understand Differing Effects of fidelity on Learning (STRUDEL).

        "abstract": "A critical capability of simulation-based training environments is the degree to which they present a faithful representation of reality. However, there is a scarcity of scientifically-sound tools and methodologies to assess when increased fidelity will lead to better mission effective performance, and thus substantiate associated high costs that often accompany the development of certain simulator features. To address this gap, the Fidelity Levels for Optimal Training Effectiveness (FLOTE) system will be developed to assess the training value of high-cost simulator features that have uncertain or inconclusive expected utility based on subject matter expert (SME) input. As part of the FLOTE system, SME judgments will be fused with more objective data via mini-experiments. The result will be a summary of what is known about the features, including the current levels of uncertainty, such that the decision-makers are better positioned to make smart investments and, therefore, reduce costs while maintaining optimal training for Warfighters."

This digital receiver is built around a fast superconducting analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which has low noise, low power, broad bandwidth, and high linear dynamic range.  A similar superconductor ADC can be closely integrated with cryogenic sensor arrays (such as microwave kinetic inductance bolometers or MKIDs for single-photon imaging), enabling both reduction in system power and scaling to large imaging arrays.  During Phase I, HYPRES will customize the ADC designs for different MKID array sizes, develop semiconducting and superconducting signal conditioning amplifiers, and simulate system performance.  The first customized ADC will be fabricated and demonstrated in Phase I option. During Phase II, HYPRES will work with an established detector laboratory to integrate the ADC with a system testbed for the MKID array and demonstrate its performance.  Similar ADCs can be applied to digitize other cryogenic sensor outputs for imaging arrays, such as transition edge sensors (TES), superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD), and superconducting tunnel junctions (STJ)."

First, we will expand prior analyses of swarm operations to characterize operators need for observability and directability of automated planning tools. Second, we will leverage this analysis to design a set of novel interface techniques that enhance the operators situation awareness and projection of swarm system behaviors across multiple perspectives and levels of abstraction. These interfaces will extend common interface methods from real-time-strategy games to address specific swarm system challenges. We will also adapt advanced swarm algorithms to better support the operator in understanding when and how interaction should happen with system entities. Finally, we will extend in-house software tools to rapidly prototype ASSIST swarm supervisory control interfaces. We will use these prototypes to demonstrate and evaluate our approaches and to deeply explore the complexities of supervising swarm systems."

Our focus will be on human status awareness and commanding abilities to enable behavior shaping and swarm management for swarms of 100 to 1000 members performing Naval surface and subsurface missions in environments where communications (both human-swarm and intra-swarm) may be severely restricted, information uncertain and where swarm members may be lost.  We will build on previously validated approaches to swarm and multi-UAV control to develop Human-Swarm Interactions (HSIs) to command tunable swarm shaping behaviors, while providing status-conveying interface components and decision aids for the operator to issue these commands in effective ways.  We will also support novel conditional commanding of swarms, which is critical to many militarily useful swarm behaviors. In Phase 1, we will proceed through scenario selection and interaction requirements definition, to HSI design and experimental testbed, hypotheses and methodology definition and will complete a cognitive walkthrough of our proposed design and scenarios illustrating interaction coverage and acceptable performance time for human usability."

This compact concept uses an actively driven two-stage approach to separate liquid out of a mixed phase inlet without introducing any additional pressure drop nor complicated supporting architecture in a two-phase pumped cooling loop. It draws minimal power by harnessing gravity in the first stage and superimposing it with vortex driven inertial forces to separate the bulk of the liquid while guaranteeing a wetted liquid outlet. The second stage employs a mechanical centrifugal action based upon the proven rotary separation technology developed by our implementation partner, Honeywell. The combination of these stages provides a robust, low power, highly reliable phase separation technology that can simplify high performance cooling system design and ensure liquid-only supply to the refrigerant pump.  Paragon brings to this effort its expertise in thermal control systems and two-phase hardware development, and through its partnership with Honeywell a large portfolio of commercial research in two-phase cooling technologies, high reliability sensors, valves, pumps and other hardware fundamental to such systems."

        "abstract": "Two-phase refrigerant pumped-loop systems are a promising approach to efficiently and effectively remove heat from high-power density electronics, sensors, and weapon systems of future warships.  One of the key technical challenges of these new thermal systems is maintaining the flow stability and system reliability under the dynamic motion of a ship.  To address these challenges, we propose to develop a refrigerant liquid-vapor phase separator whose performance is insensitive to roll and the dynamic motion of a ship. The innovative phase separator will help eliminate long two-phase flow transfer lines, enhance the condenser performance and prevent vapor from entering the refrigerant pump, and thus enhance the system reliability.  The phase separator is much more compact and has a much lower total mass and refrigerant holdup than a conventional gravity-assisted phase separator. The proposed phase separator builds on Creares proven gravity-insensitive phase separator technology developed for aircraft vapor compression systems and spacecraft pumped-loop systems.  In Phase I, Creare will design, build, and demonstrate a proof-of-concept phase separator.  In Phase II, Creare will build and characterize a phase separator for a potential 100 kW two-phase pumped loop demonstrator and the deliver phase separator to the Navy for further performance characterization."

        "abstract": "Informatics-based material development is becoming increasingly important as the physics-based multi-scale methods are not sufficiently matured to correlate complex structure-property-processing relationships for materials with 12-15 components.  However, informatics-based methods require large quantity of good quality material data that are typically downloaded manually from the material databases.  The proposed work in Phase I will initiate development of a software tool-kit that will capture, manage and analyze material property data from material databases.  In Phase I, CFDRC will evaluate the capabilities of existing data scraping software to handle material data and their ability to be integrated with external analysis tools.  We will also develop and verify a code for determining data quality of captured property data from material databases.  The technique will be applied to analyze materials and property data relevant to a specific part of a typical marine gas turbine engine.  In Phase II an API based customizable software tool-kit will be developed that the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) community can use to aid material development."

QuesTek will build upon its licensed and previously developed HEA and Ni-based superalloy databases to assess the thermodynamic and kinetic descriptions of hot section materials. Using experimental data from the literature and previous alloy optimization programs, QuesTek will assess the accuracy of these databases and models and quantify their uncertainty. The tool will be developed and applied to HEA and Ni-based superalloy materials, examining processing\/structure and structure\/properties interactions, including phase stability, processing parameters, resultant microstructures, precipitation growth simulations, and strength models for these alloy systems. Phase II efforts will further develop the tool to enable automatic ICME gap and error detection using additional statistical methods to uncover missing and inaccurate data in ICME models and databases. Other key material properties of turbine materials (e.g. corrosion resistance, CMAS infiltration) will be evaluated Phase II. Successful ICME tools designs will be incorporated into commercial ICME tool packages in Phase III. Rolls Royce Corporation and GE Aviation, two of the worlds leading manufacturers of turbine engines, will provide feedback and guidance on key ICME goals."

Modeling will be developed using Star CCM+, a Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) platform from CD-Adapco. We presently use this for corrosion analysis when we need to incorporate computational fluid dynamics to take the variable electrolyte geometry explicitly into account.  The model of the primer will be built using a combination of CAD and image processing software in conjunction with Computational Fluid Dynamics and electrochemical modeling, to explicitly take into account the 3-D geometry, electrochemistry and electrolyte behavior in the resin.  Because Star CCM+ is available to NAVAIR on the DoD Highly Parallel Computing (HPC) Platform, Corrdesa will build models that NAVAIR can modify and use for optimization.  To make the modeling accessible to M&amp;P engineers, Corrdesa will also supply a simplified GUI, and engineering tools based on extensions of Corrosion Djinn and relationships derived from the full CAE model.  In order to fully understand the electrochemistry and the effects of geometry, metal pigment size, primer morphology, etc. we will use a combination of Elsyca CorrosionMaster and modifications and extensions of Corrdesas Corrosion Djinn."

The development of such coatings and their application to DoD assets is currently impacted by the lack of fundamental understanding of these coatings and their protection behavior. Under this SBIR, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes to develop a physics-based toolkit for electrochemical modeling of the interactions between the material system comprising of the metal-rich primer, substrate surface and the environment. The framework will leverage existing electrochemical models for corrosion chemistry and take into account all the interfaces matrix\/particle, primer\/substrate, and primer\/topcoat. In Phase I, ACT will develop the preliminary framework necessary for capturing the electrochemical interactions and demonstrate sample results for their feasibility. Efforts would be made to match the simulation outcome to measurement data supplied by NAVAIR and open literature."

        "abstract": "The cost of corrosion for Navy and Marine Corps aircraft is approximately $2.6B per year with the majority of corrosion damage caused by galvanic corrosion.  Traditional chromate primers, in addition to being environmental and health hazards, have not been effective in decreasing the corrosion cost and do not protect from galvanic corrosion.  Recently developed metal-rich primers (MPRs) have been identified as promising replacements for chromate primers with the capacity to protect from galvanic corrosion.  MRPs are highly customizable, however lack of understanding of the effects of the many tunable formulation\/particle options on coating properties and corrosion protection has limited their development and use.  An accurate electrochemical and generalizable coating model is needed to enable new and improved protective materials that are less costly to design and faster to transition to market.  Luna proposes to develop a finite element method model in Phase I to focus on the electrochemical interactions of the MRP with a substrate by considering the galvanic throwing power of the MRP.  It will be expanded in Phase II into a comprehensive coating modeling tool for Al-rich and Zn-rich primers that accounts for topcoat effects, degradation with time, defects, and presence of galvanic couples."

An ideal AM energy source should have the ability to couple the heating mechanism to the characteristics of the feedstock; it must have in-process inspection capabilities that can track critical parameters; and it must provide feedforward process control capabilities. Micro-Induction Sintering\/Melting (MIS\/M) is a new additive manufacturing technology developed by Grid Logic that is based on high-frequency induction heating. It permits sintering and melting of metallic powders and wires. The company has demonstrated an ability to tune the MIS\/M signal to the characteristics of the feedstock and to achieve a very high degree of heating control. Grid Logic proposes to develop an MIS\/M print head operating at multiple frequencies to address the need for an improved AM energy source. This improved AM energy source could significantly improve consolidation efficiency, provide thermal gradient and temperature control. It would include both inspection and closed-loop process control capabilities needed for quality AM production."

        "abstract": "The wisdom of the collective is increasingly being regarded as a force that can be harnessed for creative problem solving. Collective expertise has been demonstrated to solve problems that have challenged experts for years. However, current platforms are limited to simple models of task distribution and collaboration. There is little technology support for crowdsourcing complex, collaborative, time-critical problems. The issue of training such large, distributed teams also remains a challenge. This proposal seeks to advance the state of the art with a platform to develop and harness multiple layers of collective expertise for collaborative problem solving. This multilayered approach makes it possible to tap into the skills of a large crowd, while simultaneously providing increased levels of trust and expertise through a layer of community sourcing. This enables a high degree of flexibility in finding the right mix of skills for each problem. The platform addresses the challenges of optimal task allocations, schedule and budget management, and efficient performance assessment. Furthermore, the platform supports an apprentice-based training model where the crowdsourcing mechanism is leveraged to provide personalized learning experiences. Phase I will result in a detailed system design and the development of a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate feasibility."

        "abstract": "The Navy must train and deploy effective teams in a variety of complex domains, from intelligence analysis to field medicine. For example, intelligence analysts preparing the battlespace need a team of experts to interpret a variety of multi-INT sources and incorporate local socio-cultural context, and field medicine often requires a team of doctors skilled in a variety of disciplines. Training individual personnel in all the skills and knowledge required by these missions would be cost-prohibitive and inefficient. Instead, teams are constructed to optimize their collective expertise. To construct these teams, the Navy needs a team development system that manages task and learning assignments to dynamically construct teams with the expertise to achieve evolving mission objectives. To meet this need, we propose to design and demonstrate a system for Group Learning and Optimization of Collaborative Workflows (GLOW). GLOW constructs teams that have the collective expertise required to address complex mission tasks through a combination of dynamic task and personnel ecosystem models, task and learning assignment optimization, and tools for effective team communication and collaboration. Probabilistic predictive models evaluate potential contributors, and a simulated market algorithm distributes tasks and learning assignments to balance personal development and mission requirements."

        "abstract": "Miniature munitions fuzes comprising microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors packaged with energetic materials are sought for improving fuze reliability, volume, and cost.  For some munitions, MEMS fuses may reduce unexploded ordnance rates by an order of magnitude and provide space for extra propellant or explosive to increase range or effect.  Creare proposes to develop a wafer-level packaging approach suitable for low-cost, high-volume production of MEMS fuzes.  The approach uses conventional MEMS packaging approaches and equipment where possible to minimize development efforts and cost, but it also necessarily includes developing new low-temperature wafer bonding processes that are safe for energetic materials and sensitive MEMS devices.  In this Phase I project, we will use our preliminary packaging processes and materials concepts to formulate a wafer-level packaging approach for MEMS devices and energetic materials specified in Navy MEMS fuze concepts.  We will model the thermal and strength properties of a baseline package design to show compatibility with energetic materials constraints and package performance requirements and also perform a rudimentary demonstration of a low temperature silicon wafer bonding approach.  In a Phase I Option, we will begin developing wafer layouts for future MEMS fuze package prototypes to be developed, fabricated, and tested in Phase II."

We propose Smart Weather InstruMentS (SWIMS) system to measure environmental parameters at the ocean surface as well as in the stable atmospheric layer at the air-sea interface. SWIMS is an autonomous mobile surface buoy and tethered blimp for atmospheric measurements. A novel wave generated jet propulsion system propels the SWIMS buoy system. An automated winch system inside the surface buoy will deploy the airborne meteorological sensor platform.   We will transmit all the geo-registered meteorological data to a ground station via a satellite communication link. SWIMS uses a Behavior based autonomy software architecture onboard the surface buoy platform. We will use re-chargeable batteries with the help of solar panels to power the system for a long period of time."

In combination with a commercial unmanned surface vehicle as a base station, Arets unique RAP design comprises an Autonomous Mobile Marine Met Station (AM3S) system. The resulting AM3S system is designed for routine and directed measurements of the marine ABL providing an autonomous sampling capability similar to ocean buoys, floats, and gliders.

        "abstract": "An autonomous air-sea interaction measurement system is needed to support data collection for the DoDs naval operations.  Timely and accurate characterization of the air-sea interaction is needed to improve DoD operational capabilities.  Air-sea interactions are important inputs for weather forecasting, understanding electro-optical propagation, and predicting the operation of ballistic weapons such as the EM railgun over water targets.  Current air-sea interaction data are sparse since they are typically obtained from sensor packages on passing ships.  Further, existing profiling systems are not well suited for autonomous deployment due to size, power, and cost.  We propose a marine drone-sonde system that is accurate, compact, covert, easy to deploy, and capable of operating autonomously for months at a time.  The marine drone-sonde system comprises a commercially available unmanned surface vessel (USV) and Creares small multi-rotor drone that supports a suite of compact atmospheric sensors.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach through design, analysis, and testing of critical system components.  In Phase II, we will develop, test, and validate a prototype of the system and demonstrate its performance and value in a field test."

In order to decrease antenna size and maintain G\/T, the T term, which is the system noise temperature, must be lowered. We propose to study the feasibility of installing a C-band cryogenic cooled LNA with improved noise performance. We will concept a new, smaller antenna and define the weight savings realized with a smaller antenna and radome. If awarded the Phase I option, we will develop concept antenna pedestal designs with the optimal blend of composite and metal structures. The final size and weight budget will be used to develop concepts for alternate placement of the new multi-band antennas on the targeted ship class superstructures, out of the downwash zones of our latest naval aircraft."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a shipboard troposcatter system, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Wideband Communications Enabled Through Shipboard Troposcatter (WEST) system. WEST is based on state-of-the-art tropospheric RF propagation analysis and hardware-accelerated algorithms to control the existing shipboard CBSP C-band antenna and modem. Specifically, the innovation in the WEST system design will compensate for ship-to-ship motion dynamics in sea states up to at least World Meteorological Organization (WMO) level 5 (rough). As a result, WEST offers up to 100 Mbps throughput at bit error rate of 10^-5 or better, and directly addresses the PMW\/A-170 requirements for reuse of existing Commercial Broadband Satellite Program (CBSP) and commercial-off-the-shelf troposcatter modem systems. In Phase I, POC will determine the technical feasibility of the WEST troposcatter control algorithms to increase communications capability for shipboard application reaching technology readiness level (TRL) 4. In Phase II, POC plans to develop, demonstrate and validate a WEST prototype which can maintain at least 10 Mbps throughput. By the end of Phase II, the WEST technology will reach TRL-5-6 and be ready for initial testing for potential transition to Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) and the Wideband Antijam Modem System (WAMS)."

        "abstract": "The presence of the minerals pyrrhotite in concrete aggregate can reduce the structural integrity and life expectancy of a concrete structure by as much as 90%. In Canada and the Northeast U.S., pyrrhotite-rich aggregate has had a devastating effect on the housing sector, causing approximately $1 billion in damages in the past decades. As a large consumer of concrete for a multitude of construction and repair jobs around the world, the U.S. Navy may face significant costs associated with pyrrhotite related concrete corrosion. To minimize facilities maintenance and sustainment costs, there is a need for a method for detecting and quantifying the presence of pyrrhotite in source aggregate and formed structures to assess existing structural integrity and prevent pyritiferous aggregate from ever being used. Existing diagnostic methods must be carried out in a lab, are overly expensive, and highly time consuming. To meet the needs of the Navy, Luna will develop a portable, compact, robust, electromagnetic sensing system capable of providing rapid, near real-time diagnostics of pyrrhotite concentration in aggregate and formed concrete structures in harsh, field environments."

The detected chemical fingerprint of the various mineral species will be used to identify species.

As an option, that system will be designed in detail in preparation for a preliminary design review, prior to construction of a breadboard system for in-situ testing in Phase 2."

        "abstract": "Pyrrhotite is an iron sulfide mineral found in diverse rock types. Its presence in the aggregate used for concrete construction can produce damaging effects associated with oxidation of pyrrhotite in the presence of water and oxygen. Available methods of detecting pyrrhotite do not suit routine field applications. This project will develop a portable test system based on NMR relaxometry principles for nondestructive field detection of pyrrhotite in aggregate and concrete. NMR relaxometry provides information on the physico-chemical environment within solids with different pore system characteristics. Background studies of soil and the work on aggregate and concrete conducted in the course of preparing this proposal have demonstrated that the presence of pyrrhotite produces distinct and quantifiable effects on the NMR relaxation parameters. The proposed Phase I project will tailor the design and operation conditions of a portable NMR to suit the targeted application. A systematic experimental program will be planned and implemented in order to devise a test protocol and data analysis procedures for accurate and reliable detection and quantification of pyrrhotite in aggregate and concrete. The results will be used to assess the potential of the approach to meet the targeted requirements of the development effort."

Significant risk to ship capability and safety is further ensued when obsolescence is reached while equipment is at sea and unavailable for upgrade. The government has defined common practices to mitigate those risks while lowering the overall total cost of ownership. Activities such as parts list monitoring and screening can minimize risk by consistently cross checking ship equipment configurations against Government Industry Data Exchange Program discontinuance notifications. These practices, as well as the others defined within the ARINC 2000, are presently not automated by technology and require significant effort by personnel to implement. These processes can be automated through an open source solution which performs automatic software-based analysis of the remaining life cycle of shipboard equipment, tracking of COTS obsolescence, creation of mitigation and compatibility solution planning, and visualization of what if analysis business decision analysis. Our approach will perform this assessment through the integration of four innovative techniques for accomplishing data collection, data storage, automated software learning techniques, and web server generated analysis presentation."

Conventional approaches using this method have required expensive, bulky optics, and computer resources that were greedy in speed and memory and power. Recent advances is compressive sensing and compressive processing have resulted in the ability to use the inherent ability of compressive detectors to under-sample to great advantage to reducing detector bulk, cost and data processing. In this proposal the simplicity of the single pixel imaging camera is exploited to provide a simple and robust multispectral operation directly on the compressed data through compressive processing. This results in not only a simple multi-spectral camera design, but also highly optimized compressive detection and classification techniques can be used directly on the compressed data set. It proposed that Busek design a single pixel camera that has the ability to image passively in the visible, NIR, and Far IR wavelength. It is also to perform as a ranging camera in the near IR using LIDAR. The system proposed by Busek will result simpler yet more effective method of passive target identification and classification using these techniques."

        "abstract": "Nokomis will use its Hiawatha detection system to provide robust and ruggedized identification and tracking capability for water- and air-borne targets of interest. The Hiawatha System utilizes an ultra-sensitive RF sensor to detect, identify, and track electronic targets by monitoring and leveraging their RF emissions including non-intended RF emissions from so-called dark targets. Previous Nokomis work has demonstrated highly accurate detection, identification, and geo-location of electronic targets from vehicle and airborne platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) at ranges up to 15 km by leveraging unintended RF emissions. Targets of interest to this application include small watercraft, Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV), and the proliferating variety of small form factor autonomous systems all which provide small boresight targets for detection. The proliferation of electronic systems onboard these types of targets, however, make them excellent candidates for detection through unintended RF emissions. Most automatically steered or autonomous targets utilize GPS information to navigate, and while not active RF emissions, the GPS connection and associated system electronics provide an electronic signature that Hiawatha can detect."

These are not integrated in a manner representative of the actual reentry body. Development of GPS antennas that may be incorporated onto tactical Navy reentry platforms, such as the Trident II D5 will result in an additional navigation system and improved guidance. FIRST RF proposes the integration of a GPS antenna for incorporation on the curved aft closure of the Trident II D5 reentry body. The antenna will be compatible with the integration requirements and environments, while still providing good sky coverage and efficient operation for satellite signal reception. The antenna will incorporate innovative material science and robust mechanical packaging techniques to enable compatibility with the thermal and vibration environments on board the Trident II D5. The FIRST RF solution is applicable to a variety of reentry and hypersonic platforms."

Our proposed solution uses conformal apertures to meet the platform requirements.In the PH I Base, SI2 will simulate and optimize planar GPS aperture performance. We will also simulate the performance of a conformal version of the aperture and develop a manufacturing plan for the conformal GPS aperture technology. SI2 will validate the electromagnetic design and additive manufacturing approach via fabrication and test of planar (base) and conformal (option) proof of concept hardware demonstrators to demonstrate TRL 4 at the conclusion of the PH I program.

On a related program, IERUS has developed re-entry vehicle antennas directly utilizing the vehicle&apos;s own thermal protection system (TPS) as a radome to include performance through hot and cold environments and in the presence of the post-reentry char layer. As applicable, this design approach will be incorporated into the GNSS design suitably modified for installation and operation on the curved aft closure plate of the vehicle. IERUS will perform design to include full-scale vehicle modeling to assess gain coverage and phase ripple, addressing requirements solidified post-award. During Phase 1, IERUS will also fabricate and perform VSWR and pattern testing on prototype elements, mitigating risk early in the program."

        "abstract": "Capturing GPS data during reentry flight tests will reduce the effort required to recreate a trajectory after flight. In order to test a more representative reentry body, an antenna will be designed that accounts for a rounded aft surface. Toyon Research Corporation proposes designing a conformal antenna that operates at L1\/L2 GPS frequencies with sufficient bandwidth to support military codes. The antenna gain pattern will be customized to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the GPS signal in the presence of plasma. Maximum SNR will be achieved by optimizing the antenna pattern in such a way as to increase the available GPS signal while decreasing reflections from the plasma. Design challenges will include accounting for antenna-to-plasma interactions and changing material properties due to high reentry temperatures. Toyon will also develop specialized GPS acquisition and tracking algorithms for an advanced receiver that will provide capabilities that are not currently available to military and civilian systems. Toyons team has direct experience with designing and building flight-qualified antennas, GPS receivers, navigation algorithms, and reentry bodies and systems."

        "abstract": "In this Phase I effort, FIRST RF will develop and evaluate concepts enabling Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communications using field deployable multi-band antenna arrays. The novel multi-band array topology allows for a compact and light weight system to be fielded that operates over S-Band, C-Band, and Ku-Band, has a 360 field of regard in azimuth, and can maintain a 20 Mb\/s data link over each band at distances up to 70 nmi for longer than 8 hours continuously at Ku-Band and 23 hours at S-\/C-Band. Low weight is maintained by fielding a passive aperture with a wide elevation pattern which allows for a ground-to-air relay allowing the system to operate in SATCOM-denied environments. The antenna system also has the benefit of a narrow azimuth radiation pattern conducive to point-to-point communications and networking waveforms minimizing the probability of intercept. The system is designed to be radio agnostic, allowing for a variety of commercial and military-grade radios to be integrated with the antenna system allowing for future-proof compatibility with the advanced transceivers currently under development. FIRST RF proposes an innovative approach that leverages innovative array architecture to provide a frequency-diverse communications node that uses airborne relays to facilitate BLOS communications."

        "abstract": "This work will validate a new method to quickly and safely cool the brain and body in a combat setting to help those with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Cooling the brain reduces edema (swelling), which has been shown to improve survival rates and brain function. Current techniques that try to provide early cooling for TBI are impractical in the combat setting, have potential safety risks or they are not effective in cooling. We are currently developing a device for use in a commercial hospital environment for treating fever and cooling post-ischemic events, such as cardiac arrest. This simple device uses no active chemicals or other potentially harmful materials. We believe that it can be modified such that it can be used in a combat setting, at the event site. We will demonstrate the safety and cooling efficacy of our existing device in a pig study. We will also examine the commercial device to assess the level of effort to harden it for use in a combat setting."

        "abstract": "DoD personnel are at increased risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both wartime and peacetime training incidents. Post-injury swelling (edema) is a common physiological complication of TBI which can result in added physical damage to the brain, increasing the risk of mortality, chronic encephalopathy (brain damage), and long term disability in personnel suffering TBI. Studies have demonstrated that rapidly lowering brain temperature can reduce the incidence and severity of intracranial edema as well as mortality and complications during treatment and recovery. Several approaches for achieving cooling have been successfully demonstrated in human and animal studies, but few options currently are on the market and none of these technologies are particularly well suited for military implementation. To fill this operational gap, Vivonics is proposing to develop ICEPICC (Intranasal Cooler for Encephalopathy Prevention In Combat Casualties), an intranasal cooling system based on forced cold-air convection, which is simple and well suited to the military environment because it is easily operated and supported in a wide range of settings and has shown to provide effective cooling."

        "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the signature injury of current conflicts accounting for approximately 20-25% combat casualties. Commercially, it is the primary cause of worldwide morbimortality in people under 45 years old. In the USA, TBI is estimated to be 1.5 million cases annually, resulting in over 50,000 deaths which is similar to European numbers. Today, a specific prehospital treatment remains lacking and clear clinical strategy is controversial. Cell damage is not only produced by the initial trauma itself but by a series of resultant pathophysiological mechanisms that are initiated almost immediately and perpetuate the damage caused by the initial trauma.This effort will design a hypothermic delivery system which includes nasopharyngeal PFC cooling with closed loop control in a lightweight, mobile package for first responders. Closed loop control will be based on non-invasive vital signs measurements. Technology today presents innovative methods to obtain a variety of efficacy measures available including heart rate complexity, cardiac output, EEG, EEG, r-SO2 and dynamic trending of state assessment. Connectivity between current USN\/Marine wearable medical sensing platforms and a novel therapy for TBI suggest a pre-hospital solution specifically for the POI environment."

        "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a growing issue on the modern battlefield as well as training facilities. The brain experiences damage, inflammation, and termination of cell functions when a patient has a TBI. Infection, usually accompanied by an increase in temperature, can exacerbate the after-effects. Studies have shown that cerebroprotection such as quickly cooling the brain can reduce long term effects of brain trauma. The key to therapeutic hypothermia is in the ability to reduce the brains temperature while maintaining a normal 37C in the extremities and core. Often times these injuries are a result of a blast or in conjunction with other peripheral injuries, and the body must maintain its temperature to repair elsewhere. Wolf has conceptualized a non-invasive, therapeutic, neuroprotective solution that can quickly cool the brain temperature while actively monitoring the patients core temperature and thereby regulating the device. The concept is lightweight, portable, and adaptable to all patient sizes and body types. Wolfs cryogenic intranasal cooler utilizes proven chilling technology and readily available materials to maintain a low end user cost. The device is modular and components will be easily field serviced if damaged."

This novel approach will allow for seamless integration into numerous tactical vehicles, and provide an intuitive, actionable analysis user interface for rapid assessment by the Motor Transport Officer or Commander.Problem Statement: While airborne platforms can ensure pilot experience through mission-specific simulation hours, Marine Corps tactical vehicle drivers have often not been trained and certified by the Motor Transport School. As a result, drivers can be deployed with insufficient training, leading to a higher risk of accidents.Plan\/Process Outline: Using Commercial off the Shelf components, a vehicle-agnostic system will be designed for real-time capture and storage of vehicular data, along with integral location, acceleration, velocity and temporal data. This system will support analysis and correlation of captured data, as well as other mission-specific and situational data, in a graphical, actionable format, with support for export to alternate systems for data sharing across the Department of Defense. A standards-based, open XML format will be used for data storage, leading to increased sharing across agencies."

Reducing costs and avoiding mishaps depends, therefore, upon the governments ability to effectively train drivers, monitor their driving behavior, and identify drivers in need of remedial training. Currently, the Marine Corps has limited means to assess the capability or experience level of an individual to operate ground tactical or commercial vehicles.Fortunately, modern vehicles contain sophisticated Electronic Control Units (ECU) with accessible bus interfaces. These interfaces produce data that can be used, with appropriate algorithms, to assess driver behavior, fuel consumption, and maintenance needs. In addition, access to location (via GPS chipsets) and motion dynamics (via 3-axis accelerometers) is available at low cost through ubiquitous tablet, cell phone devices, and related chipsets. Location information and motion dynamics can be fused with ECU-provided information to provide even more accurate assessments."

We propose to leverage miniature Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) electronics devices such as a Controller Area Network (CAN) data logger\/streamer and a low cost Android tablet\/smartphone with GPS and accelerometer sensors, to record the naturalistic driving data during the trip, report the data to a computer server, and automatically detect critical incident events or risky driving behaviors for driver performance assessment. This system will enable a simple point and click query or filtering by the Motor Transport Officer or Commander to identify fully qualified or deficient drivers for mission operation or training purpose. Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of the E-TRIP approach through laboratory and vehicle tests. In Phase II, we will develop the prototype E-TRIP system, and validating the system performance through large scale fielded vehicle tests."

Specifically, the innovations in hybrid tiled EPD and auxiliary OLED support the collapsible form-factor and built-in processor for disconnected operation. As a result, REFLEX offers sunlight and low-light readability, enabling Marine Maintainers to view schematic diagrams, drawings, etc. at the point of maintenance, and to access full-motion video through standard interfaces including USB, VGA, and HDMIall while complying with MIL-STD-810, which directly address the USMC requirements. In Phase I, POC plans to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of REFLEX concept through material testing and modeling, leading to a prototype. In Phase II, POC will fabricate and test up to three prototype systems based on Phase I results and assess prototype capabilities to meet USMC requirements, proceeding directly to Phase III transition with low-rate initial production of evaluation devices and follow-on acquisition strategy."

The state estimate, a probability mass function encapsulating the existence of a target and its potential position and velocity, contains 225,000 data points for every ping. This information will serve as the input for a deep convolutional neural network which will label regions of the field as target, bottom clutter, ephemeral clutter, or empty. This labeled map will be used to reduce clutter by improving snippet scores, and increasing the speed with which persistent clutter is identified by MAC. Other improvements include an enhanced operator display and better ping control algorithms. Anticipated Benefits\/Commercialization: clutter suppression, enhanced operator displays, improved ping control for Multistatic sonar with applications to image, speech and hyperspectral data."

LASSIE employs advanced probabilistic models to featurize and train deep neural networks. By combining a recurrent neural network with deep generative models, it is possible to discover representative probability distributions for non-target objects and thereby reject input which is non-conforming. The use of a generative model also has the advantage that novel environmental conditions can be discovered and trained without the need for experimental data collected in the field. Our approach includes echo synchronization and geolocation as well as a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning strategies for target detection."

In the MAC sonar system, while MIMO increases data rate relative to SIMO, the clutter effect also increases and transfers from one mission environment to another. To address the critical need, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes the design and implementation of the Deep-Sonar system, which provides an unsupervised\/semi-supervised spatial-temporal deep learning solution for the MAC sonar system. The Deep-Sonar system will provide a high-accuracy solution on analyzing MIMO sonar data in a flexible setting to identify targets in different (shallow or deep water) environments. We will prototype the proposed algorithmic workflow of Deep-Sonar and test it with representative scenarios in IAIs Ontology-based, Distributed, Composable Simulator that has been developed for Navy. We will demonstrate the feasibility of Deep-Sonar by evaluating its performance under realistic underwater scenarios with respect to different Tx\/Rx configurations and clutter levels. Deep-Sonar will reduce the clutter from each ping by at least 25% by application of semi-supervised and unsupervised spatial-temporal deep learning to MIMO sonar data that will reduce the number of clutter events for 4 transmitters to 1 transmitter level."

        "abstract": "The capabilities of the HYDRA-70 rockets in use with the US military have quickly outgrown those of the current generation of rocket launchers. These capabilities require that launchers provide pre-launch electrical power to wake-up guidance electronics, send data to the rocket including laser code settings for the laser seeker, initial conditions such as range to target and transfer alignment, fixed target image templates and mobile target parameters for the imaging seeker, and receive data from the rocket for command confirmation and guidance built-in test status checking. Launchers must also be capable of accepting signals from a MIL-STD-1760 interface, allow for arbitrary firing order, cockpit-selectable ripple or single fire, rocket inventory data, rocket presence detection, launcher service-life recording, and launcher built-in test. To meet the current and future launcher requirements of the US Navy, Luna proposes the development of a guided rocket inductive link system - Luna WInd (Wireless Inductive) Link. This wireless inductive link will accept signals from a MIL-STD-1760 interface and then wirelessly send commands to and from the rocket. The Phase I design will focus on creating a functioning prototype inductive link, and will conclude with the development of a Phase II transition plan and a laboratory demonstration."

        "abstract": "The objective of this SBIR program is to develop sensors to increase oxygen mask use by pilots and provide information about pilot respiration. NanoSonic will integrate two kinds of sensors into pilot oxygen masks to 1) determine comfort and fit, and 2) indicate respiration rate and pulmonary function. First, we will integrate stretchable piezoresistive Metal Rubber strain sensors into and onto the mask material to provide a measure of comfort, fit and seal. Strain levels corresponding to correct fit will be determined for each individual wearer and verified each time the mask is donned. Second, we will integrate an optical fiber respiration sensor into the mask so its exposed tip is near the nose of the wearer. By depositing a set of structured molecular layers on the tip of an optical fiber, the fiber can be used to measure changes in humidity associated with respiration. Change in humidity as a function of time during exhaling gives an indication of pulmonary activity along the respiratory airway. Used in this way, the unobtrusive fiber sensor can be used as a spirometer to determine airway resistance and provide an indication of pilot activity. NanoSonic will develop and deliver prototype sensors during Phase I."

This face-piece technology, referred to as the High Performance Oxygen Mask (HPM), design can be simply and seamlessly integrated into existing oxygen systems, improving the mask design to resolve complaints and eliminate pilot pain and discomfort and therefore significantly increase pilots discipline in properly wearing the mask. HPM face-piece design utilizes state of the art by integrating new mask design with modern manufacturing processes. By utilizing modern molding processes the soft face seal can be over-molded onto the mask frame, allowing for far greater control of the human\/mask interface than the two-part legacy designs where as soft face-seals are held in place with a separate hard shell frame, such as on the old MBU-5\/P, MBU-20\/P and MBU-23\/P mask design. Furthermore, by utilizing Liquid Injection Molding (LIM) processes, complex shapes of the face-piece and its over molding on the plastic shell can be controlled."

To meet this challenge, NanoSonic will design, synthesize, and empirically validate an innovative, lightweight (&lt; 9.0 oz.\/yd2) tri-layered fabric ensemble that provides sufficient air exchange for evaporative cooling and yet instantly seals to a watertight state for &gt; 6 hours. When this fabric ensemble is immersed, the differential pressure resulting from the air to water transition will provide a compressive force that transversely deforms \/ collapses micro patterned gel elastomers into a coalesced, watertight barrier that is both flexible and durable. When the compressive force is removed upon exiting from the water, the elastomeric resilience of the gel microarrays will enable complete restoration to their original pattern and restored waterproof breathable performance. NanoSonic has successfully developed state-of-art HybridSil Diver Armor drysuit materials that have completed multiple successful form, fit, and function NEDU evaluations with Navy Divers and will build from this experience to realize its Navy SBIR goals."

        "abstract": "US Navy carrier recovery operations are executed under any conditions. Margins of error are small, as failed approaches can lead to catastrophic consequences. Landing Signal Officers (LSOs) are Naval Aviators who facilitate the safe and expeditious recovery of aircraft aboard aircraft carriers. As technology has advanced, LSOs have better information and systems to guide aircraft to the deck; however, the Landing Signal Officer Display System (LSODS), which displays and configures this information has fallen behind. Specifically, the control interface used to navigate its deep and complex menus is unintuitive (in form and proximity to display outputs) and inefficient. To modernize the LSODS and enhance LSO performance through increased efficiency and lowered cognitive workload, Charles River Analytics and our partners at Carrier Landing Consultants propose to design and demonstrate a prototype system for a Touchscreen Analog Input Device (TouchAID). TouchAID is an overlaid screen bezel for the LSODS displays and a series of intelligently-located (based on LSO tasks and workflows) analog buttons that activate the touchscreen, while providing positive indication feedback through visual and haptic modalities. TouchAID provides buttons with the tactile response of traditional analog buttons, but overlaid on a touchscreen to map directly with display effects and provide reprogrammability."

        "abstract": "The DOD seeks a touchscreen ruggedized with a reconfigurable physical button module for use in harsh environments such as a US Navy Aircraft Flight Deck. Current touchscreen systems do not provide sufficient tactile feedback for Navy personnel. Software buttons are easily reconfigurable, but the physical feedback for the user (vibrational\/haptic) when pressing those buttons is often too low intensity to be felt through gloves and in high stress high vibration environments such as the flight deck. This makes using touchscreens challenging as the user does not know if software buttons were selected or not. Physical buttons provide sufficient mechanical feedback, but generally are difficult to reprogram. Many of the systems used by the flight crew are safety critical, so it is imperative that the user gets adequate feedback when software button selections are made, such that they can maintain focus and situational awareness on deck. A system is desired that integrates a physical button module that is reconfigurable, rugged, and programmable into a touchscreen display. Mid proposes to develop a novel clear touchscreen overlay, featuring a suspended piezo-electric array. The piezoelectric array suspension will provide intelligent haptic feedback balancing traditional mechanical button sensation and improved vibro-tactile stimulus."

This Navy project provides ideal opportunities to customize WARC-H versions for the Landing Signal Officer Display System (LSODS) Use Cases. Innovatively and uniquely WARC-H enables each user to visually see augmented reality semi-transparent forearm panels with controls (user selectable semi-transparent 2D\/2.5D\/3D controls that solve the longstanding lack of haptic feedback problems). Users intuitively receive dual haptic feedback from their forearms and fingertips as they use one hands fingers to press controls displayed on the other arms forearm panel. Our displays are developed per application by an integrated product team including our cognitive and human-factors scientists (4 Ph.D.s) working with the subject matter experts, and the software\/hardware engineers. Mode changes to dynamically real-time reconfigure WARC-H (LSODS) applications on-the-fly are already provided as a simple flipping your wrist over gesture. Key benefits\/advantages especially important for this projects LSODS Use Cases are based upon exploiting human users innate proprioception (knowing your limbs positions without visually looking) and haptic feedback including: Users being able to stay eye-on focused on the landing aircraft; while simultaneously enabling users to make control button selections WITHOUT looking."

In this Phase I SBIR, Navmar Applied Sciences Corporation seeks to evaluate this prospect, assess existing and emerging production methods and materials, identify candidate sonobuoy parts for additive manufacturing, and ascertain when the use of AM technology may be economically feasible to support full-volume, high-rate production. Our goal in the performance of this SBIR project is to reduce sonobuoy weight and cost while improving performance. While AM may apply to a large number of sonobuoy components, the more complex and costly components may provide the best opportunity for innovative use of AM techniques and higher cost savings. In particular, NASC intends to study the application of AM to the fabrication of an improved DIFAR sensor. While NASC boasts a modest AM capability, our expertise lies primarily in development of expendable ocean systems and underwater acoustics. We will therefore solicit technical inputs from Fabrisonic and Solid State Ceramics, companies actively engaged in additive manufacturing, to leverage their production experience with metal components and piezoceramics, respectively, into the sonobuoy design."

        "abstract": "The Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) water twister is an important component for future U.S. Navy launch and recovery capabilities, and innovative technologies are needed to ensure high performance and availability. Creare proposes to develop a handheld Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) to identify incipient component degradation before failure so that preventive measures can be made before missions or personnel are put at risk. Our handheld HUMS can be used during actual arrestments, spin tests, or engineering investigations to quickly and easily assess water twister health. During Phase I, we will demonstrate feasibility by developing the necessary signal processing algorithms and equipment interface and by evaluating performance with representative operational data. During Phase II, we will refine the design, produce prototypes, and demonstrate capability in land-based and shipboard operational environments. Benefits of Creares approach include simplicity, portability, and prognostic ability to identify degradation prior to failure. Creares AAG water twister HUMS leverages our signal processing, algorithm, and hardware technologies already proven for machinery health monitoring and human physical activity classification. Due to the existing maturity of Creares prognostic algorithm technologies, we expect a Technology Readiness Level of at least 6 at the end of Phase II."

        "abstract": "The arresting system is a critical component to ensure mission readiness and pilot safety during landing operations on an aircraft carrier. The Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) water twister is the most critical mechanical component for absorbing kinetic energy from landing aircraft and as such it is necessary to ensure its reliability and health status. Issues have previously been identified with the design of the new AAG technology, specifically with the water twister, which has led to delays for system delivery and increased cost. A man portable diagnostic tool is desired to accurately and reliably assess the health of the water twister, for which no inspection tools have yet proven reliable. This proposal describes an acoustic emission (AE) inspection solution which will allow for detection, localization, and classification of damage within both the rotor blades as well as the stator plates. AE technology has had great success in early damage detection in a wide variety of rotating machinery applications. New, patent-pending shear sensitive AE sensors will be used to distinguish and isolate water-borne noise sources. Detection will focus on both cracking and corrosion damage, and advanced algorithms will be used to precisely identify damage location within the water twister."

A significant number of critical systems  such as the Joint Mission Planning Systems (JMPS)  are wired tightly to non-centralized, individual platforms found in system of system networks. These planning systems are costly to maintain, and the ability to quickly evolve and scale software to support future mission planning is called into question. The need exists to augment and leverage existing technology capabilities embedded in software systems so that it can be dynamically repurposed to support multiplatform mission development, including mission planning for manned and unmanned aircraft.

BNS proposes to design and develop a switching technology that covers this range using three bands: 1.06 -1.8 um, 1.8-3 um and 3-5 um. For Phase I Boulder Nonlinear Systems, proposes to build photonic switching components and demonstrate coupling different wavelengths to the same output fibers. During the base effort two SWIR wavelengths will be tested. This will be extended to the MWIR during the Phase I Option. Efforts to mitigate wavelength dispersion, will also be explored.

        "abstract": "Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop a human machine interface (HMI) for dynamically controlling a set of sensors which desire to locate and identify surface vessels to meet mission objectives. A key challenge for a sensor resource manager (SRM) is determining what is most valuable at the current time. The proposed HMI will allow a human operator to influence the operation of the SRM. This influence will come in the form of a set of specified controls that are possible for the operator such as the ability to increase the revisit rate on an object in track or the collection of identification information. Another key element of the HMI will be the display of information to the operator. This information should not overwhelm the operator and should be presented in a manner that allows the operator to selectively display various sources of information. Candidate information that should be displayed to the operator includes track information from a global fusion system, currently planned sensor schedules from an SRM, and the outputs of specific exploitation tools which provide additional insight beyond what is in the global fusion database."

Through use of a novel commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) materials and unique processing steps, the ferrules will meet all the Navy specifications including overall length of 10.00+.10 mm with a diameter of 1.58600005 mm, the larger cavity length of 4.0+0\/-.2 mm with a diameter of 1.00+.03\/-.00 mm, the smaller cavity diameter of 0.1255+0.001\/-0.000 mm, and both cavities concentric to the outer diameter of the ferrule within 0.001 mm. The FOCS ferrule material has better performance in hardness and wear-resistance than zirconia ceramic. Use of low cost COTS materials, each ferrule will cost less than $40. In Phase I, RISL will develop the ferrule fabrication process and fabricate several ferrules for single mode fiber optic cable jumpers and demonstrate the FOCS feasibility. In Phase II, RISL will improve the design and process and fabricate at least 12 FOCS prototypes. RISL will measure the FOCS ferrules for accuracy and repeatability when tested for insertion loss within a range of optical fibers (e.g. 9\/125 um, 50\/125 um, 62.5\/125 um)."

In order to reduce the time and expense of testing rotorcraft hubs and shafts a modular, multi-platform, easily reconfigurable test fixture is desired. This new test system should also be capable of greater load cycles application rates to reduce testing time.Dayton T Brown, Inc. (DTB), a leader in aircraft system engineering and testing services, has developed a comprehensive solution that will meet these requirements. DTBs solution will be easily reconfigurable in order to test rotor hubs and shafts from many different rotor configurations. The system will also be capable of applying loads at increased rates to reduce test times. The baseline configuration utilizes a movable reconfigurable platform to mount the test items and apply the test loads in an accelerated fashion.Benefits of this system would be a reduction in test time and costs for both government and commercial rotorcraft manufacturers. Especially with the numerous UAV rotorcraft platforms being developed, the reduction of costs in this area will speed time to market for innovative rotorcraft of the future."

Rotor components typically are grouped into sub-assemblies and fatigue tested separately under simulated flight loads. While this is a fairly simple approach, fatigue testing sub-components may result in certain load cases not being transferred properly through the system. According to the Navy, many current test rigs, along with the software for loads input, are mechanically complicated and developed for each individual platform, increasing costs associated with fatigue tests, with each easily costing in the order of millions to conduct. They desire an innovative rotor head fatigue test stand capable of testing main rotor head assemblies as one unit for multiple platforms, with easy transition, including both 4 and 3 bladed rotor head systems such as H-1, H-60, V-22, and MQ-8B. Mid proposes to leverage its experience in designing, building, and maintaining custom test rigs to perform life cycle test, as well as its decades of rotorcraft related research and development to build a custom test rig to meet the Navys requirements."

        "abstract": "We address main issues concerning the design of modular multi-platform rotor hub fatigue test rig in a systematic way by identifying constraints that current typical hub tests experience. Our design approach starts with decoupling the centrifugal force (CF) from rest of the blade load components, such that each blade load component can be accurately generated in the test rig. The location of CF loading point close to the blade attachment point to the hub arm minimizes the effect of blade bending on other blade load components as well as the overall test rig size. Multi-platform feature comes from the capability of relocating actuators along the blade axis for a new platform test. Our proposed design will allow each and all hub arms to be simultaneously tested as valid test specimens. We also propose developing a kinematic simulation model to optimize the location of the loading and sensing points. We plan to build a scaled hub test rig, and to use highly advanced automated feedback control system and sensors such as the non-contact optical Direct Strain Imaging technology. We propose to develop high fidelity spectrum editing tool and multi-axial test data analysis tool as well to support testing."

        "abstract": "Rotor system components must be tested prior to flight certification to assess fatigue life. Developing custom test rigs for each different rotor hub due to their varying sizes and numbers of blades is the most costly approach. Safe, Inc. (Safe) has proposed a single test rig design with modular elements that can be reconfigured to address any rotor assembly or component. Hydraulic actuators can be moved into different locations and orientations for any combination of centrifugal, bending, and torsion loads. The hydraulic system accommodates differing numbers of actuators and load ranges. The control and data acquisition software also reconfigure to operate one or many actuators at different loads, independently or in unison, while measuring strain and load data. The rig will address all combinations of test items and loads such that reconfiguring for a different test does not require a new structural assessment of the rig. Safes team has prior experience developing hydraulic test equipment, as well as related experience designing aerospace hardware for structural loads including vibration-induced fatigue. The commercialization strategy describes how to transition the rig from development into production using marketing and manufacturing approaches that Safe has successfully used in the past to commercialize SBIR technology."

Additionally, simulations of potential antenna designs will be performed first in free space, and then in a representative environment consisting of a metallic ground plane in close proximity to the antenna. Finally, SI2 will design and build an antenna demonstrator for VSWR and low-power radiation pattern testing. Initial high power testing will also be performed to determine potential modes of failure at high power.In Phase II, SI2 will improve upon the concept from Phase I depending on the results obtained during the Phase I pattern and power testing.

        "abstract": "Since the final third of the 20th century, Navys airborne electronic attack (AEA) capabilities have grown to serve a unique and critical role in protecting our militarys spectral dominance. However, in the nearly 50 years since the first AEA payloads were deployed, few substantive modifications have been made to the original system hardware or design, leaving the current fleet of AEA systems in increasingly urgent need of modernization. This obsolescence is compounded by the persistent increase in both the sophistication and the capability of our enemies RF systems. In order for Navys AEA fleet to provide another half century of effective service, significant updates are required to enhance the performance and integration of next-generation AEA payloads.FIRST RF proposes a novel AEA antenna architecture adapted from proven (TRL-9) FIRST RF technologies that are specifically tailored to meet all of the performance and integration challenges associated with next-generation AEA systems. This background provides a uniquely low-risk path to meeting the objectives of the proposed Phase I program."

(MATECH) will further the design (from the functional prototype presented here), demonstrate the effectiveness, and thoroughly characterize a new aircrew active bladder relief system with low-cost disposable crew components. There is currently no fully satisfactory approach for aircrew to relieve their bladder during flight, especially for female crew. MATECHs system is compatible with all current fighter and aircraft, has greatest possible component commonality between male\/female versions, it is self-contained, comfortable, unobtrusive, inconspicuous, and compatible with current suits, gear and survival equipment without modifications. MATECHs crew body interfaces are of a novel anatomical design and made of biocompatible polymers for excellent seal and comfort. The small and simple device is comfortable for extended wear and will be worn under the flight suit. The device uses a smart modular pumping device with full and leak sensors for fail-safe and rugged operation. It empties into a pressure compensated bladder capable of unpressurized flight up to 50,000 ft. Power will be supplied by a self-contained rechargeable source also worn by the aircrew. In Phase II MATECH will build an air-worthy prototype. At the end of the program MATECH will have production-ready units available and a manufacturing plan in place."

        "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) as a concept has been in existence since the 1960s, used in fighter pilot cockpits for some time augmenting pilot performance. AR has continued to see technological leaps in accessibility and affordability with systems such as Google Glass and the Microsoft HoloLens becoming available to the general public. Mobile-based AR is also on the rise as smart phones become ubiquitous in todays society, with apps like astronomy app Star Chart and the briefly wildly-popular game Pokmon Go. Despite these advances, however, AR as a whole is still largely underutilized in areas in which the enhancement of human performance can have the most benefit. This is because in many ways, AR is a technological solution without a clear set of general guidelines for what problems AR solves and to what efficacy. In order to address this innovation gap, Soar Technology proposes to develop the Media Efficacy Return on Investment Tool (MERIT). MERIT is a theoretical framework methodology and tool for quantitatively evaluating AR and other training solutions for a given training environment based on four factors: Task Factors, Training Media Factors, Return on Investment (ROI) Factors, and Training Efficacy Factors."

        "abstract": "Although augmented reality (AR) is a promising technology, it has not yet made a substantial impact in the training domain. While there is a lot of research in specific low-level cognitive and perceptual tasking, the research results have not yet been shown to apply to the training domain, making it difficult to compare with other technologies. In response to these challenges, Aptima, Inc. proposes to design, develop, and commercialize the Mixed and Immersive Reality Assessment Generation Engine (MIRAGE), a quantitative analysis tool consisting of an experimental methodology, an AR testbed capable of emulating AR device characteristics within virtual reality environments, three comparative training solutions, and a decision support tool that automates data collection and provides analysis on experimental results. MIRAGE will provide to NAWCTSD researchers an experimental framework that will allow researchers to develop experiments to assess the impact of device characteristics and affordances. Researchers will be able perform effectiveness assessments using simulated AR head-mounted displays to determine the capability of AR now and to predict its feasibility in the future. MIRAGE will support automated data collection through system-based measurement, giving researchers the objective data they need to compare the effectiveness of AR training solutions with other comparable solutions."

To develop the TEE-TEST, our team will develop a training efficiency framework that combines approaches to evaluating training and cost effectiveness based on established, evidence-based best practices. This framework will be tested by conducting comparative analyses of three training prototypes (AR, mobile, and game-based) developed over the course of this effort. The findings of this research will inform the final TEE-TEST as well as address the gap in evaluations of AR technology for training. We propose to use Naval aviation preflight checklist training as a domain for our TEE-TEST training development. In addition to being a well-suited domain for comparison across mobile, AR, and game-based platforms, preflight training checklist execution is a critical issue for Navy pilots."

        "abstract": "Missile fuels require high volumetric energy density. The two leading fuel candidates are JP10 and RJ5. Both of these fuels are synthesized from cyclopentadiene, which is turn is produced from naphtha cracker. The primary purpose of naphtha cracker is to produce ethylene. In addition, naphtha is further produced from petroleum crude. Thus, the entire high energy density requirement of the DOD is catered by side product of another process and petroleum feedstock. The proposed innovation circumvents cyclopentadiene based chemistry. The feedstock for the proposed fuel synthesis scheme are naturally occurring as well as can be synthesized from renewable materials. The final product will exceed the net volumetric heat of combustion of JP10. The team will develop the overall scaleable process to produce such fuel. In addition, pertinent quantity will be supplied to the Navy for preliminary testing at the end of phase I."

        "abstract": "To combat the growing sophistication and frequency of cyber-attacks, the nations cyber-warriors must train vigilantly. Computer network defense (CND) training currently takes place either on operational networks or in virtual (or simulated) environments. The major drawback to using virtual environments is that they lack a sufficient amount of realism. Virtualized systems are frequently overly-simplified mock-ups of operational systems and lack the fidelity necessary for optimal, effective training. Training on operational networks provides a full-fidelity environment and enables the warfighters to train as they fight; however, the attackers are placed under significant restrictions to protect the operational network, since they cannot disrupt or damage network resources in the course of the exercise. ATC NY will develop the Red Team Attack Injector (RETAIN), a training system for emulating cyber-attacks on operational networks and restoring systems to normal operation at the conclusion of the exercise."

The solution will advance todays state-of-the-art where realistic training on real operational networks is limited by the risk that a command is willing to tolerate to accommodate training. Live red teams produce realistic results, but are limited in their availability and the scope of what they can accomplish given real-world and exercise constraints. Cyber ranges or dedicated training facilities can create highly stressful training, but this training does not occur of the real operational network on which the staff and computer network defense personnel will operate. MIKELs solution will allow for software emulations to be introduced on real operational networks, supervised by a training coordinator. The solution will allow for the ability to update the threat database, to address emerging and theater-specific threats as needed."

        "abstract": "The Phase I proposal presented here details a procedure to produce metal encapsulated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for integration into steel cabling for aircraft carrier arresting cables. The addition of CNTs traditional steel cabling has the potential to significantly improve cable strength and longevity. However, current methods for CNT integration struggle due to CNT aggregation and poor interfacial interactions between CNT and matrix. The proposed process is based on a simple, scalable, one-pot process that uses emulsion chemistry to coat a metal on the surface of the nanotubes. This coating will create an iron-coated CNT nanopowder which enhances the binding of CNT to the steel matrix, improves mixability, and limits aggregation. In addition, the emulsion chemistry enhances the matrix\/CNT interface, improving both mechanical properties. The consulting investigator has previously developed the emulsion chemistry process for polymers, and together with Mainstream has developed a procedure to coat CNTs with copper for electrical wiring. The process will be adapted for coating CNTs with alternative metals and the coated CNTs will be leveraged with Mainstreams expertise in nanocomposite manufacturing."

The important aspects include polarization, beam-width and frequency of the radar, the height and elevation angle of the radar platform, and the ocean state including the orientation of the boat within the ocean. The proposed software will combine Arets hydrodynamic code, for modeling the ocean surface and the orientation of targets within the ocean, with XL Scientifics exact-physics\/full-wave integral equation (IE) electromagnetic solvers, for modeling the radar cross section of targets, and XL Scientifics asymptotic electromagnetic ray-tracing code, for modeling the interaction of the radar signal and the target with the ocean surface. In addition, Arets Radar Simulation Code (RSC) will be used to model Bragg scattering to incorporate ocean backscatter. XL Scientific and Aret will combine these separate codes into a seamless single software application. This software application will allow analysts to rapidly and accurately model the RCS of a target under a variety of ocean conditions which can ultimately be used for radar algorithm development and classification of targets."

        "abstract": "Limiting the damage to Navy ships from small-craft attacks in littoral environments will require reliable detection, discrimination, and identification of the potential threats among a number of targets against a complex and dynamic sea surface. The ability of shipboard or shore-emplaced radar systems to perform these functions is a critical issue that can only partly be judged on the basis of traditional measures of noise and clutter, or by empirical rules developed from testing at sea. It would be best to supplement these approaches with direct simulations representative of the full range of target environments, for which the electromagnetic response can be calculated over a broad band of illuminating frequencies. Statistics could then be derived from repeated sampling of relevant environmental conditions, target motions, and target geometries. Based on HyPerComps recent success in the development of high order accurate time-domain (HDphysics) and frequency domain (ParMax) electromagnetic codes that have been demonstrated for solving large-scale EM problems of a thousand wavelength or more in size, this proposed effort from HyPerComp will use full wave solvers for the entire sea state\/boat problem with no need for hybridization."

It features a payout control that allows the user to set the maximum working length, so that ejection is never allowed. It adjusts in length to support the aircrew weight when leaning out the door or into a floor hatch, leaving aircrew hands free to perform mission tasks. It does not nuisance lock when experiencing violent aircraft maneuvers or wind effects. It can be unlocked after an event without returning to the aircraft attach point. It is compatible with the Aircrew Endurance Vest and all other similar aircrew vests."

The proposed program includes the development of a lightweight aircrew-mounted tether system that addresses these deficiencies by: taking up tether slack, either automatically or upon user initiation; reduces nuisance locking by incorporating an inertia lock that is insensitive to aircraft influences; and, locates user control points at readily accessible locations on the aircrews endurance survival vest. Safes proposed program utilizes several prototype build phases for hands-on assessment of functionality of the system. A functional prototype will be presented at the end of the Phase I Base program, and the Phase I Option includes visits to multiple end-user locations early in the program to solicit feedback for design refinement during the remainder of the Option program."

        "abstract": "Currently, mobile aircrew who serve in rotary wing and vertical lift platforms relay on a manually adjustable tether connected to the CMU-37\/P Aircrew Endurance Vest for their primary restraint system while not seated. Aircrew members are at great risk of injury because they may be required to move around within the cabin at any time during the flight to perform various essential job functions. At times they are even required to lean out of the aircraft to accomplish assigned tasks of the mission. The crewmembers currently rely on a restraint method consisting of the 10-foot long manually adjustable tether that attaches to the vest via a cross-connector strap between the left and right hand restraint strap assemblies, that is attached to tie down points in the aircraft. The manually adjustable tether is the sole deficiency in this product, as it relies on the user to continually monitor the tether length and adjust appropriately throughout the mission. The GS Engineering design will interpret G-loads and lock the strap. An additional design feature will allow the wearer to have the ability to override the lock will be integrated, as planned high G-loads should not restrict the user."

The current established methodology does not test the airframe to the synergistically harmful combination of high cycle fatigue (HCF) vibratory load cycles superimposed on low cycle fatigue (LCF) caused by g maneuvers and airloads. Dayton T Brown, Inc. (DTB), a leader in aircraft system engineering and testing services, has developed a comprehensive solution to improve structural testing methods by incorporating combined HCF and LCF testing. Our approach is based upon combining our years of experience in vibration (HCF) testing with our aerospace structural qualification (LCF) testing using servo hydraulics. DTBs familiarity with multiple testing methodologies, instrumentation techniques and our previous investigations into combined HCF &amp; LCF fatigue testing have enabled us to identify areas requiring additional development; namely control system design and the application of the LCF loads to the airframe in a way that allows the airframe vibration loads to remain unimpeded. Our baseline concept integrates existing technologies to address this requirement."

Our tests will start with idealized component testing subjected to multi-axial loading with and without HCF content to assess impact of HCF on failure initiation points and failure modes. We then build test setup for a reduced model airframe substructure testing using advanced hardware, sensor technology, and data acquisition systems. We also propose developing the kinematic model of the test set up above to optimize the location of the loading and sensing points and minimize the number of actuators and sensor used. We plan to carry out the test using a load spectrum appropriately scaled to the test article and capture data from the test using advanced technology. We develop high fidelity tools for spectrum editing to support accelerated testing without incurring alternate failure points and modes and damage, and multi-axial tools for test data analysis as well as predicting life limits and inspection intervals of service aircraft structure. Based on these proposed tests and analysis efforts, we will develop concrete plans for full-scale airframe testing."

We project our RFS will fit in available spaces and will weigh significantly less than 200 lbm. In Phase I, we will generate an initial design of our RFS and compare our RFS design to existing solutions, in terms of Navy metrics. In Phase II, we will develop and deliver to the Navy a prototype RFS and demonstrate our RFS in a representative environment. In Phase III, we will deliver to the Navy a production representative RFS system that can be integrated onto an E-2D aircraft platform for aircraft-level testing. We will also sell our RFS for many other government and private-sector applications that require a starter that can produce high power with a compact and lightweight machine."

        "abstract": "Signal Systems Corporation (SSC) will develop a Maritime Acoustic Relative VELocity (MARVEL) sensor to measure the Doppler shift of an ultrasonic signal induced by the relative motion between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the deck. SSC will demonstrate the feasibility of using an innovative, small, lightweight, low-cost array of directional ultrasound sensors to produce real-time tracking velocity measurements (TVM) at low taxiing\/creeping speeds. Ultrasound sensors operating in continuous active sonar (CAS) mode are a natural fit for measuring relative velocity. The sensor is always on, allowing for the uninterrupted tracking of the Doppler shift over time. SSCs approach uses Acoustic Doppler to sense motion more directly than imaging or range finding approaches. This sensing modality does not depend on lighting conditions and a significant range of the ultrasonic wavelengths are relatively immune to backscatter from mist and fog, making it a natural choice for day and night maritime conditions."

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), taxiing under their own power on the flight deck of a ship, may not always move in the direction commanded. Deck conditions, such as fluid on the deck or the ships rolling or pitching can cause aircraft skidding, sliding, or rearward movement. Such unwanted movement fails to register on aircraft pilot instruments. A remotely located UAV pilot needs the true direction and speed of motion relative to the deck displayed. This allows for detection of and reaction to sliding or skidding and\/or to initiate appropriate emergency response if required. Skidding and sliding can have lateral as well as longitudinal velocity. A sensor suite is needed which will measure both longitudinal and lateral movement referenced to the deck and which can make these measurements for speeds as low as 0.4 mph. Mass produced very economical and rugged commercial-off-the-shelf 60-GHz radar modules measure such very slow lateral and longitudinal speed by scanning the deck. Speed measurements from two separate radar sensing techniques, Doppler and cross correlation, are presented to a Kalman tracker which heavily weights the more reliable measurement at that moment or carries on without sensor updates if sensor data is missing at that instant."

The TALC device will consist of an innovative double chamber cartridge and a new casing allowing for doubling of the payload expulsion event from the standard AN\/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System. TALC will satisfy Navy requirements for safety of operation and reliability, including the Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) safety requirements. It will allow for polling with low current signals and will produce low light emission upon chaff expulsion. In Phase I, POC will prove TALC feasibility by demonstrating the performance of the new double impulse cartridge and the new casing with two payload compartments (TRL 2-3). In Phase II, multiple functional prototypes will be fabricated for testing and performance evaluation (TRL 4-5)."

While there are still some technical challenges left in the development and integration of the new, improved chaff fibers, it is clear that these materials will provide benefit both in terms of short wavelength response and the capability to increase the number of payloads on an aircraft.In this Phase I effort, Capco will leverage its extensive impulse cartridge (IC) design, manufacturing and test capabilities to develop, fabricate, and extensively test of a novel concentric Dual IC \/ Dual Chaff Cartridge concept that eliminates the requirement for an orientation adaptor to ensure clocking of the Dual ICs and Chaff cartridges when loaded into the AN\/ALE-47. The proposed concentric IC consists of a single inner low side squib along with one or more outer high side squibs (in parallel) to normalize the pressure output on the outer concentric chaff payload. The effort will culiminate in dissemination testing of representative chaff fibers using the developed system"

The Air Force has the RR-180 Dual Chaff payload, which has proven effective. The Navy RR-129, however, has not been updated to dual-chaff configuration. Quad-M&apos;s approach is to divide the Navys chaff casing into two compartments and independently deploy each chaff payload. The technology developing the RR-180 was leveraged to develop the Air Expendable Countermeasure Decoy Device. Quad-M bread-boarded the proposed electronic circuit and demonstrated its validity in the proposal. The quad impulse cartridge is capable of utilizing a single firing circuit and providing two (2) separate payload initiations sequentially at two (2) different firing times. No hardware or software changes in the AN\/ALE-47 CMDS are required. The Air Expendable Countermeasure Decoy Device maintains the same form factor as the RR-129 cartridge. No cost impact will occur other than a minimum cost impact on the expendable countermeasure due to the fact that a second squib is used. This technology will increase the number of expendable countermeasures dispense events without modifying the existing airframe structure and will increase the aircraft survivability from RF missile threats."

Campbells research group at the UVA. Demand of such photonic receiver arose from the urgent need of high performance microwave photonic links that replace the conventional metal cables for better SWaP, immunity to EMI and broader bandwidth. In Phase I base period, UVA will design the PD structure based on their existing 1064nm PD devices. PSI will study the PD package in term of thermal management, optical and RF integration and hermeticism. In Phase I optional period, we will fabricate and characterize the PD chip for performance metrics including bandwidth, responsivity, saturation power and linearity. PSI will make the PD package and demonstrate the proof-of-concept PD prototype receiver. In phase II, we will continue to refine the chip fabrication and packaging process for hermetic commercial products and for building advanced microwave photonic links. This effort will then provide a commercially available, compact, high-performance receivers at 1 micron wavelength. PSI is poised to insert such a module into our existing DoD projects targeted at microwave photonic links, RF signal generation and broadband antenna arrays."

IFOS proposes to leverage on its directly related experience in advanced optical transceivers for DWDM as well as optical networking architectures to implement distributed built-in-test (BIT) capability into aircraft networks for real-time measurement of optical loss, polarization extinction, crosstalk, and other important parameters. For this purpose, the same wavelength used for digital\/analog signal communication will be used for network performance monitoring purposes based on software-controlled algorithms. IFOS plans to employ the existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and modules to lower the cost and accelerate transition."

This would be particularly useful in a Wavelength Division Multiplex (WDM) based network topology that relies on each physical location having unique and permanently assigned transmit and receive wavelengths. Since the MIL-STD-1760 specification does not allow for electrical address strapping for identification purposes, the optical identification ability that comes for free with our proposed Built-In Test (BIT) approach would enable the payload to appropriately tune its transmit and receive wavelengths without installer intervention. This capability would drastically ease the logistics of payload management and eliminate the possibility of human error."

        "abstract": "There are numerous conditions where gas turbine engines ingest small particulates. Of particular concern are the particles (~1-10 micrometer) that are ejected into the atmosphere as volcanic ash. Ingestion of these particles has numerous detrimental effects. Particle collisions cause abrasion of compressor blades, leading to loss of efficiency. Ingested particles that partially or completely melt in the combustion region can deposit on downstream structures, leading to decreased airflow. These particles usually cannot be removed and may require replacement of the engine. Such particles also plug the small holes used for film cooling of turbine blades and nozzle guide vanes, leading to blade overheat and failure. The proposed research will develop a discrete-element method for the transport, reaction, collision and adhesion of small particles in a gas turbine engine. This model will be developed to be incorporated with existing CFD codes. This tool will allow engine designers to assess the vulnerability of their designs to ingested particles and to examine the efficacy of proposed mitigation strategies. Since both military and commercial aircraft are subject to performance degradation due to ingested particles we anticipate interest from military, commercial and industrial gas turbine designers and manufacturers."

These accumulated particles lead to engine failure in real-world applications and are of great concern to the Department of Defense and engine manufacturers. To address this gap in simulation capability, the Turbine Geometry with Accumulating Particles (T-GAP) solver will be developed as a standalone program that interfaces with existing CFD software and estimates the changing geometry within a gas turbine engine due to particle accumulation in an iterative process. T-GAP consists of a comprehensive particle phase change database and a sophisticated particle solver that together allow for changing particle shape, aerodynamic drag, state (i.e. molten, partially molten, or solid), and adhesion coefficient for many types of particles. T-GAP will allow the US Navy to speed up the design of effective shielding components or engine tolerance characteristics. Ultimately, T-GAP may be adapted to become an effective early warning system on aircraft avionics electronics to warn pilots or maintenance crews of an impending estimated engine failure."

The effect of particle ingestion in aircraft and helicopter engines has negative impacts on their performance and durability that lead to multiple issues such as enhanced corrosion, build-up and eventual blockage of air pathways, and potential catastrophic failure. One particular problem that has been of recent interest is particle reactivity of sand and volcanic particles. Solid particles are already an issue due to the corrosion they cause to the surface and coatings of the engine blades. Due to the already high combustion temperatures and increasing engine temperatures in state of the art gas turbine engines, these particles can also melt and adhere to engine surfaces such as stators and rotors. High-fidelity simulations that accurately capture the flow and particle physics can greatly aid in the design processes of solving these problems. The proposed modular high-fidelity multi-physics tool can be integrated into a variety of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software packages."

        "abstract": "Surface ship ASW personnel will go for long stretches at sea without conducting ASW operations, which results in skill degradation. The Navy has embedded training in operational systems for decades but has never closed the loop between the training and operator performance. In order to address this need, Sonalysts, Inc. proposes to develop an innovative Gamification Training Architecture (GTA). The proposed GTA will be designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind. It will host existing gamified training content and will support investigation of future gamification techniques. Specifically, the G-API interface that we propose to build as part of the GTA will facilitate the hosting of third party developer content. The GTA will include a unique learner model for the shipboard sonar operator. The Learner Model in the GTA will be the first that we are aware of that is linked to a tactical system to capture on-watch performance. By mining the data stored across multiple operators, we will gain new insight into how a sailor generally learns aboard ship. This functionality will have a significant impact on the way training is designed and conducted. It will also impact the allocation of training topics between schoolhouses and ships."

        "abstract": "Polymer matrix composites are increasingly replacing traditional metallic materials in marine platforms due to higher strength to weight ratio, ease of design, and corrosion resistance. Despite these advantages, the detection of cracks, flaws, and weak points within a structural composite, resulting from impact or fatigue, is difficult to visually detect by maintenance personnel. Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and structure health monitoring methods for detecting composite damage can be effective, but are time consuming, expensive, and impractical for frequent routine inspections. A simple, visual indication system is desired for inspection personnel to detect potential composite damage quickly, preventing structural failure and reducing the time and expense of instrumented NDE testing. Luna has developed damage indicator paints for composites that visually change color in response to impacts or fatigue capable of damaging the underlying substrate. This affordable, easily applied paint will allow Navy personnel to rapidly identify potential composite damage in the field without the use of expensive equipment. Lunas system will be further enabled with the use of a tough, protective, antifouling surface to ensure excellent visual indication following composite damage."

DAAD communicates both the severity and location of damage to technicians through a single point interface. DAAD compares the measured, ply-by-ply, strain state of a structure, obtained through embedded fiber optic strain sensors, to its predicted strain state, obtained through the input of onboard environmental sensors in its damage identification algorithms. Damage visualization algorithms and processes will be employed to transform fiber optic locations to a 3-D coordinate system representative of the structure. This ensures intuitive interpretation of data by personnel of minimal training. SDC proposes a test plan to investigate the structural effects fiber optics have on a structure and will then integrate the DAAD system into a representative submarine component during the Phase I option. DAAD insertion is expected to yield an ROI of 17 upon installment to its first Navy Asset."

        "abstract": "A need exists to improve the ballistic response of armor for Littoral Combat Ships. Simply increasing armor thickness is unacceptable because the associated increase in weight and space would reduce vessel performance speed and range. Surface treatment techniques for current armor materials such as steel, aluminum and ceramic may improve armor performance significantly without an associated weight penalty. Ormond has developed a low cost cavitation peening process that has already been shown to improve ballistic response of silicon carbide and boron carbide armor. Since that testing by the Army, cavitation peening has improved considerably. The process imparts deep residual compressive stresses in other materials of interest also, such as steel and aluminum. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of improving ballistic response of armor materials through cavitation peening. Improvements will be quantified through ballistic testing. Major advantages of the process include its low cost, ability to peen ceramic as well as metals, its suitability to use in ship yards (even using existing pumps and robots) and the ability to peen large structures in place through the tankless peening process. It is also environmentally benign, using only recycled water."

        "abstract": "The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is a naval vessel developed to deal with unconventional post-cold-war threats. To protect valued assets, and still maintain the ships maneuverability and speed, the U.S. Navy requires lighter-weight armor. NanoCoatings, Inc. and South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology propose a plastic-deformation mechanical treatment, friction-stir-processing (FSP), to enhance the performance of aluminum (Al)-alloy armor and encapsulate lightweight ceramic armor. The finer-grained FSP microstructure increases ductility and has been shown in preliminary ballistic tests to prevent penetration of an Al-alloy plate, compared to full-penetration of an equivalent areal-density Al plate. Our team proposes two unique concepts: 1) FSP of Al-alloy armor surfaces and 2) Encapsulation of alumina-ceramic tiles by FSP within an Al-armor package. Characterization will include: 1) x-radiography, 2) metallographic analysis, and 3) mechanical-property testing. Armor packages will be screened by ballistic tests, at the University of Dayton Research Institute, for comparison with baseline Al-armor. In the Phase I option, V50 ballistic tests will be conducted on a down-selected armor concept and a demonstration armor panel, showing form and fit, will be fabricated for trial integration with LCS. Preliminary process specifications will be developed and an analysis of manufacturing process scaling will be performed."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for a diffractive optical element for light field displays, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a novel Diffractive Hogel Achromatic Lens Array (DHALA) technology based on the integration of three key technological components proven by POC: (1) the multiplexed aberration-compensated holographic optical element design, (2) the direct-write hologram printer array recording technique, and (3) the efficient holographic contact-copying mass production process. Representing a new diffractive optical element technology, DHALA has advantages in much-improved size, performance, and cost over the refractive microlens array, in terms of imaging quality, uniformity, reduced aberrations, and manufacturability. These advantages, provided by POCs optical modeling and low-cost fabrication process, have not yet been accomplished by state-of-the-art approaches. In Phase I, POC will develop a concept for DHALA for wide-FOV light field displays and low-cost manufacturability based on the proposed DHALA technology components, design and fabricate a DHALA element to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology, and verify performance of the component by preliminary bench-top testing. In Phase II, a deliverable prototype DHALA element will be developed, demonstrated, and tested for its optical performance and potential integration into a light field display for the Navys AEGIS combat systems."

Using inkjet-print manufacturing, a series of prototype diffraction-limited achromatic gradient-index lensletssized from 100 microns to 3 mm, and configured in gradient-index hogel arrays up to 125-mm in formatwill be designed, modeled, fabricated, characterized, and shown to have properties superior to the current refractive microlens hogel optics. It will be shown that large-format diffraction-limited achromatic lenslet arrays can be rapidly designed, printed, and delivered, at a small fraction of the cost of existing approaches."

Simple proximity badges with large-format PIN will allow an inexpensive modification within requirements to accommodate hoods and gloves sometimes in use. A centralized ability to provision user credentials, group membership, and the ability to reset proximity badges will allow onboard self-service by the crew. Authorized ship command personnel will be able to bypass authentication during emergency mission conditions to meet effective and responsive command and control. By providing an API via the Cybersecurity hub, additional subsystems may leverage this capability as well. As a natural extension of ship Cybersecurity, centralized and adjustable two factor authentication will support multiple modes and inexpensive provisioning of this vital component."

The research will support the Navy in seeking data visualization techniques that consider human capabilities and limitations in product design to capitalize upon human sensory and perceptual attributes. The Navy currently utilizes two dimension (2D) display technology for conveying data and information to sailors performing both non-tactical and tactical operations on AEGIS Destroyers and Cruisers. Three dimension (3D) visualization technologies provide the opportunity to promote improved operator task accuracy, faster operator response time, and reduce cognitive overload, but there is no common standard similar to the 2D API that allows for the cost-effective integration of 3D display technologies. Our solution will employ a common optimized 3D graphics standard\/API that can be understood and adopted by novel 3D display developers encompassing as many 3D visualization technologies as possible. Our solution will provide for an AEGIS display environment that allows the operator the flexibility to choose the best display device for the visualization task without an expensive and time-consuming integration or development effort. The API will support accelerated 3D rendering for novel multi-view display"

        "abstract": "The ability to resolve depth within a scene whether natural or artificial improves our spatial understanding of the scene and as a result reduces the cognitive load accompanying the analysis and collaboration on complex tasks. A light-field display projects 3D aerial imagery that is visible to the unaided eye (without glasses or head tracking) and allows for perspective correct visualization within the displays projection volume. Light-field rendering is the process of rendering all the perspective views present in the light-field from a 3D model regardless of viewer position. Modern graphics language such as OpenGL and Direct-X assume a singular point of view and are structured to render into a single viewport within a framebuffer. As such, multi-view rendering becomes the responsibility of the host application which has to understand the exact nature (view point, view orientation, moment in time) of each view for a particular light-field display implementation. In addition, additional light-field display specific APIs are needed to control rendering which reduces application portability. The primary technical objective of this proposal is to develop a light-field display agnostic application interface\/scene description that can be used in a heterogeneous 3D display environment and relieve the host the burden of multi-view rendering."

        "abstract": "Both the Deep Skirt and Advanced Skirt System material used on Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) experience significant wear during normal operations, which require expensive, time-consuming maintenance repairs. The US Navy is looking for innovative new material and manufacturing method for skirt systems to improve it durability and reduces Total Ownership Cost (TOC). Rubber skirts experience two modes of periodic motions, stick-slip oscillation and micro-vibration generated during frictional slidings of rubber. Liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) fiber, such as para-aramid fiber Kevlar and polyarylate, is known for its high tensile strength =25g\/d that is 5 times of nylon fiber, high cut resistant and vibration damping properties. By placing a small amount of expensive LCP fiber on the surface would protect from stick-slip oscillation and micro-vibration to reduce surface abrasion.Kubota Research Associates has demonstrated abrasion resistant on a vinyl ester hard composite surface in the NAVY SBIR N091-047 title; Innovative Weight Reduction Concepts for Unmanned Surface Vehicles.We propose the development of a co-vulcanized 2 layers composite structure, which is a nylon fabric reinforced Neoprene laminate layer and small amount of LCP fiber doped Neoprene elastic composite thin layer that would greatly extend the life with minimum cost of the skirt."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in new, solid state radar technology, signal processing techniques, and the use of actively scanned electronic arrays (AESA) by our adversaries has alerted many defense leaders to the fact that the U.S. no longer maintains technological supremacy in electronic warfare (EW). Advanced detection radars employ new electronically scanned apertures and incorporate many modes of operation, including FMCW waveforms. Modern digital, solid state radars have the ability to take advantage of agile waveform techniques which can rapidly vary pulse repetition patterns, carrier frequency, pulse width, modulation type, polarization, and scan intervals. Newer adaptable radar systems may also continuously change waveforms in order to mitigate channel effects or provide optimum returns based on target radar cross section (RCS) in order to try to maximize their signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR). This seemingly random and diverse set of modern radar threats causes traditional Electronic Support (ES) systems to 1) miss-identify pulses; 2) inaccurately classify\/identify threats; and in some cases prevents detection, classification and identification entirely. Expedition Technology has developed new and innovative digital signal processing de-interleaving algorithms to better detect LPI emitters and identify threat radars using single pulse identification and to also resolve ambiguities between multiple solid state radar emitters."

        "abstract": "Advances in semiconductor technologies, including Gallium nitride (GaN) and Silicon carbide (SiC), are allowing for the wider use of solid-state devices in modern radar systems. These devices include direct digital synthesizers and their associated memories, i.e. numerical look up tables for reprogrammable radar parameters, as well as solid-state power amplifiers (SSPA). Since solid-state systems are generally limited to much lower peak powers than their vacuum tube predecessors, they use much higher duty cycles to get equivalent energy on targets. This means that traditional methods of radar detection and classification, i.e. measuring pulse width, pulse repetition interval, carrier frequency, and amplitude, which are at the heart legacy electronic warfare support systems, are becoming less and less effective at providing an accurate and complete picture of today&apos;s battlespace.SEA CORP believes that the more viable solution to the solid-state radar emitter detection, classification, unique identification, and tracking of vessels lies in the application of new algorithms to the digitized RF spectrum. The algorithm will consider novel ways of analyzing pieces of the RF spectrum to extract features not previously analyzed. Regardless of frequency\/frequencies of operation, waveform shape, or transmit power, every radar system still has an amplifier and aperture which are unique."

Capabilities developed will provide improvements to threat detection, identification, and intent estimation to augment the SLQ-32 SEWIP Block 2 Electronic Support (ES) capabilities. CRTC will focus on the challenges of short engagement timelines (10s of seconds), emitter spectral agility, and threat platform agility through threat feature expansion, advanced characterization, and real-time behavior learning. CRTC targets an emitter threat space including surveillance, fire-control, navigation, and (Anti-Ship Cruise Missile) ASCM seekers. Of these, ASCM threats represent the greatest challenge to the SLQ-32, since any delay in detection and identification functions can have immediately lethal consequences. The Phase I effort will emphasize applying cognitive and deep characterization techniques to improve threat warning and Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) decisions for the counter-ASCM mission."

PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) offers an unparalleled combination of excellent hydrophobicity, chemical resistance, and thermal stability. GVD uses an innovative, solvent-free process to create the PTFE fluoropolymer coating. GVD can optimize PTFEs hydrophobicity, adhesion, and optical clarity during deposition. Reactive fluorocarbon vapors deposit uniformly across the optic surface, forming the durable water-repellent PTFE coating. The nano-texturing needed for low reflectivity (i.e. low glint) can be created in the surface of the PTFE film through careful choice of deposition parameters."

Next generation ISIS systems will see a size reduction and more advanced sensing capabilities, including multispectral imaging. The photonic mast will incorporate multiple transparencies including hyper-hemispheric domes to allow for 360 panoramic viewing, and will greatly increase battlefield situational awareness. The photonic mast windows must be durable and hydrophobic for the extreme maritime environment; and transmit over broad visible and infrared wavelength ranges to provide transparency for the range of sensors to be incorporated. The Navy has identified that current antireflection coatings do not adequately meet mission specifications for bandwidth, durability, and hydrophobicity; and cannot be reliably deposited on next generation ISIS hyper-hemispherical domes. An innovative and rugged solution to the AR problem is based on Random AntiReflective (RAR) textures imparted directly into the domed windows. Durable AR surface textures have been shown to exhibit ultra-hydrophobic properties, and possess optical performance that is far superior to thin film coatings with respect to transmission, bandwidth, and off-axis performance"

Phase I will demonstrate the tolerance to both repeated and extended exposure of a prototype cell to very low voltage (~0V) where the cycling shows no deterioration in performance. Phase II will develop and deliver a minimum of five large format (~9 Ah)prototype cells to the Navy for pulse load testing.

        "abstract": "We propose developing a data fusion system which takes a set of contact lists from a multi-sonar multi-look MCM system and generates a unified, fused, and geo-registered contact list. We will design the system to begin with a list of contacts with geographic locations and a set of detection features. The first step in our system will be to preprocess the contact locations for sensor registration and gridlock. At the same time, we propose a feedback loop: if the gridlock finds that two lists ought to have a contact in common but do not, we can go back to the raw sonar data and look for evidence of the contact. Further, we will maintain a history of gridlock solutions as functions of platform kinematic state and use this to generate gridlock even in the absence of significant contact list overlap. Once the contact locations have been locked to a common grid, we apply Metrons custom-developed eXtended Maximum A Posteriori (XMAP) Bayesian contact association algorithm which utilizes all contact features. Once contacts are associated we will perform Bayesian data fusion feature-by-feature. This fusion step also constitutes geo-registration as we also fuse location estimates from all available contact lists."

Our approach builds upon over 30 years of exploiting powerful data analytic tools and previous work with the AN\/AQS-20. Using Arete&apos;s in-house developed tools, each detection will be localized in 3D space utilizing measurements made by the different modalities at different times. A modality specific feature vector will be used to classify mines, tethers, and anchors for moored mines tethered to the sea floor. The results of the localization and classification will be used to identify different detections as being part of the same mine and fuse them into one feature vector. Finally, Arete-developed framework will be used to classify each fused feature set as being either target or false alarm. The optimal combination of spatial and temporal information from each sensor will provide a powerful and robust object classification algorithm that will reduce false alarm rates and improve localization in SONAR MCM applications."

        "abstract": "SSC will develop adaptive transmit control (ATC) and Bayesian environmental characterization (BEC) to supplement existing adaptive beamforming technology and close the loop to realize a fully adaptive active sonar (FAAS) for mid-frequency anti-submarine warfare. ATC will automatically adjust transmit parameters such as waveform, amplitude, duration, repetition rate, and spatial pattern to optimize both track maintenance and search activities without operator involvement. BEC will combine in-situ measurements and physics-based acoustic modeling to develop a probabilistic description of the prevailing environment that is carried forward to the signal excess calculations needed by ATC. Our approach naturally accommodates source restrictions such as thermal limits and waveform crest factor so that our solution achieves significant performance improvements with minimal impact to existing fleet hardware and software. A FAAS simulator will be developed to establish performance levels for U.S. Navy SQQ-89 and LCS VDS systems, examining key metrics such as probability of detection, false alarm rate, target echo SNR, latency of optimization, and robustness to parameter mismatch. The two new key algorithms, ATC and BEC, will be demonstrated and validated in real-world airborne active sonar field experiments."

Our approach is specifically formulated to leverage innovative cognitive processing and inference algorithms to maximize information gain for a robust solution under changing environmental conditions. We propose a number of innovations to exploit non-traditional information to improve the discrimination power of the fundamental input data. A key objective of this effort is to formalize and make rigorous the mathematical process for active sonar cognition. We do this by providing a methodology that allows the system to express knowledge and understanding of phenomenology in a quantitative and analytic manner. This model is then used to evaluate alternative sonar and processing configurations. Support for alternative implementations is quantified in terms of the likelihood function and its role in formal measures of Information. Likelihood Functions provide the quantitative capture of the evidence, arising from data and parameters for each hypothesis, conditioned on information gathering. Information expressed in the likelihood function and posterior distributions of control hypotheses provide the formal mechanisms for direct feedback of the value of new information. This framework is then used to assess and recommend future implementations."

At its core, we will leverage the concept of units of portability enabled by virtualization in order to respond to detected cyber events. We will augment the identified techniques with advanced techniques based upon our understanding of DDS and our related work in virtualization architectures for the DOE.

This poses serious problems for the fleet when any update to a cybersecurity tool requires integration, testing, and redelivery of the combat systems Operating System and software applications. Additionally, once that redelivery process completes it still requires an availability window on every ship of sufficient duration to support an upgrade or reinstall of the combat system. We intend to design an open and modular framework that will enable rapid updates by removing that tail-end redelivery of the combat system. As new threats are identified and new rulesets and definitions are released for existing tools, we will be able to update the configuration of the combat system servers directly from the cybersecurity framework. This framework will enable faster and easier deployment of new cybersecurity tools including those developed by third parties.

The primary components of our solution will include a consolidated security status UI that provides a single pane view of the status of the system, with an ability to access individual tool status; an open security data bus that will (securely) expose the underlying data models and the data used by every tool in the framework; a tools control and monitoring API that will provide oversight and status of the cyber tools deployment within the framework; and, finally, a framework lifecycle management interface, which will provide an automated, script-driven ability to deploy, install, safely update &amp; test, and remove cybersecurity tools. Our solution is built upon technologies that are already part of the combat system."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for an advanced, affordable, and agile direct digital exciter technology for use with existing, rotating air surveillance radar systems, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Streaming Arbitrary Waveform Direct Digital Exciter for Radar (SAWDER). SAWDER is based on POCs direct digital RF signal processing implemented on state-of-the-art digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware. Specifically, by implementing true streaming arbitrary waveform generation, SAWDER is able to provide continuously and instantly variable pulsewidths and nonperiodic pulse repetition, and modulation capabilities that include arbitrary user-defined intrapulse modulations, such as nonlinear frequency modulation. Use of POCs digital RF predistortion suppresses spur and harmonic generation, providing SAWDER with signal quality to achieve greater range and velocity accuracy with pulse-Doppler radar, which directly addresses Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) 2.0 requirements for an advanced direct digital exciter. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate, through a combination of modeling, analysis, and measurements with in-house hardware and test setups, that SAWDER can be implemented, feasibly and affordably in legacy rotating radar reaching technology readiness level (TRL)-4. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and demonstrate a SAWDER prototype reaching TRL-6."

        "abstract": "CEI is currently funded for development of a Direct Band Pass Under sampling (DBPU) design of 900 MHz (approximately) center RF using an ADC clock of 1000 MHz. The RF bandwidth is approximately +\/- 50 MHz (i.e. the same as the current SPS-49 radar). This yields an aliased spectrum centered around 100 MHz which is then easily digitally down converted via a digital LO following the ADC. It therefore makes sense for CEI to illustrate here the possibility of a design which combines both transmit and receive high performance ADCs and DACs; the exciter and receiver cannot be designed without a holistic DREX approach, even if they are not co-located. CEI will leverage an MDA\/Navy Phase II SBIR that produced a system called RARE: Radar Advanced Receiver Exciter. This is leveraged in the DPBU SPS-49\/general radar RF receiver design. The Army and Air Force have also funded expansion of the RARE concept and product line. The specific requirements needed for the MDA systems were the primary algorithmic focus of the research in Phase I; current and future MDA customer targeted algorithm and design specifications for PRF, waveforms, modes, receivers\/exciters, discrimination capabilities, etc."

        "abstract": "Because naval operators are responsible for performing preventative maintenance and monitoring the Operational Availability (AO) of a large number of vessel components within complex systems, there is a high risk of unnecessary or unwarranted maintenance of components, which can inflate costs and significantly delay deployments. Although each vessel emits copious amounts of data, this data is confined to isolated storage within each vessel, and is only analyzed when on shore. A system that fuses these disparate data sources to monitor and predict each components AO in real-time can provide a comprehensive picture of fleet-wide (i.e., battlegroup) AO. By generating a prioritized maintenance schedule based on this predicted AO, the system can also significantly reduce the cost of unnecessary maintenance. To address these challenges, we propose to design a System for Naval Data Aggregation and Planning with Probabilistic Reasoning (SNAPPR). SNAPPR uses a mature real-time data aggregation framework that fuses and reasons about data using robust probabilistic models to monitor and predict AO. SNAPPR then uses these predictions to generate an optimized preventative maintenance schedule (PMS) for the naval operator."

The utilization of cost effective and open source Big Data advanced analysis software will allow the Navy to accurately predict equipment failure based on not only the equipments real-time diagnostics, but also trends of similar equipment behavior across the Fleet. Progeny believes integration of large and disparate formats of data, including historical diagnostic data and those obtained in real-time from in-situ sensing devices, into a normalized format will enable automated analysis by open-source big data learning techniques. Analysis of equipment degradation failure trends will allow our software to automatically recommend corrective hardware maintenance prior to failure occurring. Progenys proposed solution will leverage automated data acquisition, big data storage techniques, and automatic analysis of hardware life remaining to recommend corrective maintenance prior to a failure occurring. Our true innovation for this effort will be the creation of an automated CBM+ algorithmic capability which automatically receives component fatigue assessments, invokes algorithms to calculate the impacts to dependent hardware, and recommends condition-based maintenance."

        "abstract": "Low-cost embedded FPGA devices rarely contain any cyber security measures. To combat this threat, the military is heavily investing in the development of a wide range of defensive tools. These tools require extensive redteam-style testing to assess efficacy. To address these challenges, Systems &amp; Technology Research (STR) proposes to develop a Python toolkit that will inject malware code into the various stages of the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis process. We call this approach Cyber Redteam Injection Toolkit (CRIT). CRIT will be integrated with the vendor-specific toolchain and manipulate intermediate design checkpoint files to insert varying degrees of malware at various stages in the synthesis pipeline. CRIT consists of both the Python code to manipulate the checkpoint files, the firmware produced and the hardware used for testing. This combined hardware and software solution will enable testers to generate many permutations of malware and evaluate efficacy of defensive techniques under a range of observable performance degradations. Phase I will focus on framework generation and proof-of-concept malware insertion. Phase II will focus on increasing the sophistication of the inserted malware."

During Phase I, the team will develop the concept into a preliminary design and demonstrate feasibility to straighten the array and avoid the bottom using hydrodynamic modeling and simulation of the system under a variety of ocean environments and ship movements.

        "abstract": "Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS) provide a critical Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) surveillance capability that helps the U.S. Navy maintain undersea dominance. During low speed operations, the unsteady nature of the tow environment causes the straightness (per line) and line-to-line separation of the array to deform from straight-line, constant separation cases which degrades the performance of the acoustic processing. As the tow speed decreases, the entire array sinks deeper and the tilt angle of the array increases, further degrading performance as well as putting the array at risk of damage from contacting the seafloor. Makai proposes to address the array straightness problem and bottom impact risks by developing two technologies, the SURTASS Array Straightening System (SASS) and the Depth Control Module (DCM) that can be clipped-on to existing TL29a arrays. Under the Phase I BASE effort, Makai will use CFD and high-fidelity and validated towed array modeling tools to design hydro-dynamically stable systems that meet the performance objectives and demonstrate a 1:2 scale prototype of SASS in waters off Makai Pier. In the Phase I OPTION period, interfaces with the twin-line array will be specified and the designs will be matured to support at-sea prototype demonstrations in Phase II."

ATC-NY will fill this need by developing the Attack-Detection Application Memory Monitor (ADAMM), a kernel-based memory monitor that utilizes pre-execution code analysis alongside several passive and active memory protection techniques to verify the integrity of a running applications memory space on real-time UNIX systems with high availability requirements without harming its performance. Rather than naively treating the memory space of an application as being monolithic and entirely uniform, ADAMM performs static code analysis on the applications executable binary right before it begins running. This lets ADAMM significantly reduce the impact of its monitoring on run-time performance by applying particular and specialized monitoring strategies for each different section of the applications memory space."

        "abstract": "Detecting cyber attacks before they have the chance to damage or compromise high-value or mission-critical systems is of critical importance to the US Navy. While there are many defenses available against cyber attacks, many are narrowly focused or usable only at certain levels of the software stack. In particular, application-level software is frequently the target of attacks, and can be extremely difficult to protect for a variety of reasons we will discuss. More specifically, attacks that operate on the memory space of applications are common, effective, and hard to detect using current approaches. Our system for Detecting Anomalies in Application Memory Space (DAAMS) will provide attack-detection capabilities for applications memory space that extend state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques. We complement these anomaly detectors with an intelligent scenario generator that will generate a representative range of scenarios and inputs for the application to create offline learning data that will be used to learn how to detect normal and abnormal memory behavior during operations. This approach lets DAAMS detect memory-space anomalies without affecting the applications mission-time performance."

New techniques compatible with RF MMIC fabrication in Gallium Nitride (GaN) on silicon carbide (SiC) to form a purely passive circulator for S-Band operation and radar applications with a nominal bandwidth of 1.5 GHz are required. The process must be compatible with wafer-level semiconductor device fabrication and be consistent with automated integrated circuit fabrication and assembly. Metamagnetics, in partnership with a MMIC foundry will perform the research needed to develop small, passive, self-biased, S-band circulators based on ferrite material and advanced circulator design to reduce the size of the circulator and enable integration at the MMIC level. Reducing the size of the circulators not only enhances performance through the reduction of parasitics, but offers the potential to increase the density of arrays in future radar systems.Air and Missile Defense Radar is the primary transition platform for this technology and we will develop a roadmap to the transition of our MMIC-compatible circulator into foundry processes used to build AMDR T\/R modules"

The program will first simulate and demonstrate the necessary concepts in a simpler, but no less critical device: a microwave isolator. Upon successful demonstration of the isolator, the circulator will be built and tested. The program will also demonstrate the ability to integrate the MASW with RFICs. The integration process will be demonstrated by solder bumping and flip-chipping the MASW onto a test chip. This will allow for measuring the performance of the MASW when integrated, taking into account the effects of the ball soldered connections. The combination of the demonstrated devices and their flipchip integration will result in integration with a GaN-based RFIC design to provide a low-cost, superior front end component in the Phase II program."

        "abstract": "Shipyards are responsible for creating and analyzing finite element (FE) models of submarine pressure hulls and components under hydrostatic pressure loading, whereas the Navy technical community is responsible for reviewing the modeling and analysis. Modeling methodologies are often a source of disagreement between the shipyards and the Navy, which can require additional model development and analysis cycles before they are resolved, costing both time and budgetary resources. The Navy has identified the need for a test-validated design procedure that can be used by both the Navy and shipyards to perform agreed-upon model checks prior to technical review to reduce disagreements in modeling technique.ATA Engineering proposes developing a design tool consisting of a modeling procedures manual and accompanying software that will verify and document that structural models follow modeling best practices. In Phase I, ATA will compile best practices currently used by the shipyards, combine those with general FE best practices, and identify opportunities for process improvement. ATA will select several submarine structures for study and then conduct planning and preliminary feasibility demonstrations for the procedures manual, software development, and design tool validation analysis and testing to be conducted in Phases II and III."

        "abstract": "Advances in finite element analysis (FEA) techniques have spurred debate in the Navy design community regarding the value of higher fidelity models with advanced element formulations in submarine pressure hull design. Higher complexity models can increase model accuracy, but the increased effort required to create higher fidelity models results in decreasing added value as subsequent levels of refinement are added. Cardinal Engineering proposes developing a design tool which dictates best practices for modeling and analyzing complex submarine pressure hull structures. The design tool will establish modeling criteria, backed by empirical data, to create cost-effective, technically accurate analytical models. The design tool will be developed through a comprehensive analysis and testing effort focused on specific geometries known to have introduced controversy between the design yards and the Navy during the design cycle. The geometries chosen will be examined computationally with an array of modeling methods of increasing levels of complexity. The analysis results will be compared to test data in order to provide assurance regarding the level of accuracy achieved by the analysis. Ultimately, the agreement between test and analysis will be used to establish the criteria defined in the design tool."

        "abstract": "In modern submarine design, the effort to produce more efficient, lighter and less expensive structures drives the analysis beyond simple historic empirical techniques towards a higher reliance on finite element modeling (FEM) analysis. The problem increases in complexity with the choice of FEM modeling techniques varying widely between different organizations in their choice of criteria such as element formulation, mesh density, assumptions, and boundary conditions. To solve this problem MTech will develop a Finite Element Manual to be used by NAVSEA and the Shipyards as a design tool to ensure FEM techniques are consistent and appropriate for the design detail. MTech will combine conventional techniques with innovative solutions to reduce US Navy cost and schedule. The MTech design tool will ensure equivalent tools are used, document common knowledge of best practices, provide accurate guidance and provide test verified techniques all while providing the analyst maximum flexibility."

The new standards will address the highly detailed FEM models characteristic of complex submarine structures, whose geometry is represented by solid, rather than shell, elements.

However, significant modeling choices must still be made in trying to achieve answers accurate enough for engineering decisions, but without unwarranted computational effort. This is especially true for high value complex submarine hull structures that are needed to protect Navy warfighters and enable successful missions. Using a rational series of models of varying fidelity, M4 Engineering will develop a comprehensive design guide of best practices and their temporal and spatial regions of applicability that can be utilized by the Navy and its contractors during their design and analysis activities. A comprehensive manual set giving specifications that will standardize submarine hull structure modeling best practices will be created. Artificial intelligence methods will be used to create a complementary software tool to provide an automated means for giving detailed modeling recommendations for specific designs. The design recommendations and the process for developing them will be validated via a companion experimental program that will be planned partially during Phase I for execution during later project phases."

Additive manufacturing (AM) approaches offer one path of alternative manufacturing technologies. Among various technologies, powder bed fusion (PBF) is one promising approach. Hewlett Packards Multi-Jet Fusion printers utilize a unique PBF process that presents a desirable solution to the objective of producing energetics parts by COTS technologies. Successful solids processing in a COTS powder bed fusion system requires very specific material properties, both in terms of powder handling properties as well as the associated inking\/binder system. This proposal will focus specifically on nylon based PBX systems, for which HP existing multi-jet inking systems are currently optimized. New processing techniques will be explored to improve material characteristics of AM feedstocks, namely microencapsulation of colloidal HMX by spray drying and emulsion polymerization routes. Select optimal formulations will be chosen for final printing of a small scale printed explosive on an HP Jet Fusion machine, or related development test bed. Associated performance, safety characteristics, and cost analysis of final printed parts of these developed formulations will be assessed, against existing production technologies."

        "abstract": "Achieving operational availability of mission systems is challenging for naval shipboard maintainers, who analyze large amounts of maintenance data to determine how and when to address equipment repair and replacement needs. Current data is available through a set of disparate sources that insufficiently portray the criticality of correcting the malfunction or reveal interrelationships and overall operational impacts. This makes it difficult to efficiently and effectively select, prioritize, and schedule future maintenance activities. To address this, we propose to design and demonstrate a Blended Advanced Decision GUI Environment for Reasoning Support (BADGERS). The BADGERS decision-support system (DSS) will enable shipboard maintainers to analyze system status and predicted malfunctions, evaluate high-level mission impacts, and efficiently make maintenance decisions through intuitive and innovative data visualizations. This system will provide maintainers with an integrated workspace that provides observability for fixing the issue through rule-based maintenance knowledge, as well as ecological graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to assess the operational impacts and validate root causes of predicted system failures. We will take an iterative Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE) approach and presented within a software Prototyping and Demonstration Environment (PDE) to allow for rapid integration to Navy systems."

        "abstract": "For Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) programs to help the Strike Group (SG) Operational availability (Ao) and logistics efficiency, the Navy needs an effective decision support system (DSS). Visualization of the PHM data will enable the decision makers to easily interpret the results of the DSS and make decisions that are more consistent with maximizing Ao. An efficient data visualization tool should support interactive exploration\/understanding of DSS recommendations and alternatives. A well-designed visualization system will adapt to the requirements of the user, expose patterns, trends, correlations, and provide multi-tiered results to support advanced decision-making. Intelligent Automation, Inc., and its collaborators propose to develop DELPHI, a Decision Support Engine and Learned Prognostics Human-machine Interfaces for Shipboard Maintenance. The key innovation of this proposal is to develop a data fusion center comprising of the following four components (1) Visual simulation based modeling tool (what-if scenarios); and (2) Stochastic optimization engine (to compute optimal policies) (3) Visualization engine (to optimally present context-aware information);and (4) Advanced visualization interfaces (responsive software that adapts to different interfaces). The first two push the state-of-the-art in decision support capabilities, whereas the other two improve the visualization."

        "abstract": "Critical missions performed by the US Navy require accurate and efficient classification of objects in underwater optical video. This task is performed by a trained operator; however, the optical data is generally of poor quality (low contrast and\/or low illumination), and when performed during missions the real-time video stream cannot be paused or rewound. These challenges can cause high-confidence object classification to take a considerably longer time than is desirable. On this effort, Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop efficient algorithms implemented in a software application tool that will perform accurate 3D reconstruction of objects in underwater video. By leveraging and optimizing novel in situ sensor calibration algorithms, incremental sparse bundle adjustment, and efficient 3D reconstruction algorithms, the developed software will form accurate 3D models, display the models to the operator, and update the models as optical data from varying perspectives is collected. Furthermore, the algorithms will fuse the optical data with existing sonar data for increased accuracy and efficiency."

We propose to use self-injection locking of a 1550 nm (C-band) semiconductor laser chip heterogeneously integrated with a high quality factor (Q) whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator to improve the spectral properties of the laser and generate narrow linewidth light at telecom wavelengths, in a chip scale form factor. Additionally, this approach will result in a reduced cost packaged device. WGM resonators are useful for laser stabilization since they provide very high-Q and high finesse along with very small size and high immunity to environmental and field perturbations, such as temperature, vibration and acceleration. The solution proposed by OEwaves is to extend the design of our existing commercial laser architecture to produce a ruggedized laser package with lower RIN and higher power output."

        "abstract": "There is an opportunity to develop a new solution for a reliable oil-less cooking deep fat fryer (DFF) replacement in the Ohio Replacement (OR) galley design that uses hot air jet impingement technology. The high heat transfer rate of hot air impingement has the potential to produce high volume throughput results with the best quality. Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc., (TRI\/Austin) proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of an oil-less DFF replacement cooking appliance for Navy submarines through the use of high speed air impingement heat transfer techniques. TRI\/Austin will establish technical feasibility by demonstrating that the oil-less deep fat fryer cooking appliance will meet the operational and environmental requirements. The technical hurdles will be addressed with laboratory environment testing and performance characterization through experimentation. The supportability, safety, and human factors concerns will be addressed along with estimates of size, weight, cost, and performance. The components will be tested to critical submarine vibrations and motion as outlined in MIL-STD-167\/1 Type I equipment. A vibration scan will be performed through the frequency ranges at different input levels in all three axes. This will identify problem areas, if any, that will need to be addressed during Phase II."

        "abstract": "Authorizations provided to the Navy for operation of the SURTASS LFA\/CLFA active source require specific measures to be taken to avoid harming marine mammals. This generally includes searching the water column within 2 km of the SURTASS ship for the presence of marine mammals before going active. The current workhorse for this is the High Frequency Marine Mammal Monitoring (HF\/M3) sonar. However, as the HF\/M3 ages a replacement is necessary. A capable and cost-effective replacement can be provided by a COTS hardware solution that uses high-frequency broadband signal processing. In-Depth Engineering Corporation proposes the Wideband High-frequency Aquatic Life Echolocation System (WHALES)an innovative, low-cost, broadband, passive and active acoustic detection and classification system providing full spatial coverage over a wide frequency range. WHALES will be able to detect all source modulation types, including acoustic intercept sources, and will include an automated acoustic classification capability based on a model of the mammalian primary auditory cortex. The set of passive receive arrays will be paired with an active omnidirectional broadband projector operating around 25 kHz, well above the frequency band of the SURTASS system. The active source will enable detection and localization of non-vocalizing marine mammals, navigational hazards, divers, and UUVs."

        "abstract": "Scientific Solutions, Inc. (SSI), teamed with BAE Systems and Southall Environmental Associates, Inc. (SEA), proposes to investigate the feasibility of using commercially available active sonar to autonomously identify and track marine mammals from transiting SURTASS-LFA surface ships at ranges out to and beyond 2,000 yards. Active sonar has been proven effective to detect and track marine animals under various conditions and system configurations. The logical next step is to establish the capability, conditions and configuration that would overlap with the marine mammal detection requirement provided by the current system. Then establish a route for the evolution of the HFM3 software to provide mechanisms to track, classify, and provide the ability to deliver actionable high fidelity information for the watch stander. This will be done by integrating the commercially available sonar head with the broadband track-before-alert algorithms and software SSI and BAE Systems have developed for the identification and tracking of divers and unmanned underwater vehicles in a harbor environment. These algorithms and software provide processes to improve the capability to rank and modify the classifying information. By training the classification engine database we continually evolve the classification process."

The coating will be easily installed in-situ without removing the capstan hub and will function in the demanding military maritime environment. The coating can be removed and replaced as necessary during standard refits of the overall system.During the Phase I effort, PSI and GSM will demonstrate the array-capstan friction achievable with the approach under a range of temperature and contamination conditions. In future work, the approach will be rapidly transitioned to full functional testing, optimizing both the coating friction and the installation method."

Candidate surfacing materials will be selected with the objective of demonstrating a 40% increase in friction coefficient between the coating and towed array, compared to the current baseline of shot peened metal. Material samples of each candidate will be prepared, then tested to measure friction coefficient, wear behavior, adhesion to the CuNi substrate, long term stability after exposure to Isopar and saltwater, and other measurements identified by the Navy during PI. In parallel we will compare several alternative methods for installing the coating on the capstan, either while the capstan remains inside the SSNs ballast tank, or after the capstan has been removed from the SSN. Each application approach will be evaluated for the methods ability to be applied uniformly with a coating thickness of between 0.0005 and 0.02-inch, and, when being applied with the capstan inside the tank, to complete the application of the coating replacement procedure within the timeframe of a single dive by repair technicians."

The ComPlug4SH systems ultimate goal is to increase safety when launching probes to collect sea data (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth) by providing a bridge between the submarines external environment and hull interior. The ComPlug4SH will allow to close the mechanical launcher structure (such as SUBSAFE systems and Non-Seawater Piping) while keeping a data communication channel through a hulls metallic plug, which will also be used to isolate the submarine exterior from the interior. The ComPlug4SH compiles State-of-the-Art (SOTA) technologies which include: (a) size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) optimized processing board and internal communication interfaces; (b) robust data (and power if needed) transferal through barrier; (c) external interfaces to SOTA networking systems; and (d) local processing that enables optional complementary operations such as self-diagnostics, control, and monitoring."

        "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) technology, through its unique layer-by-layer, freeform fabrication capability, has the potential to reduce supply chain issues and enable new components with superior performance at reduced cost for the Navy. Although the development of metal AM techniques has made significant advances in recent years, unique processing and material development issues will require the use non-destructive evaluation (NDE) for critical AM fabricated parts. X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) has been demonstrated as a valuable tool in identifying porosity, cracks, and delamination in metal AM fabricated parts. While commercial off-the-shelf X-ray CT systems have been found suitable for NDE of small (10s of mm) AM parts, for larger AM parts (100s  1000s mm) no such X-ray CT systems exist. This proposal addresses NDE requirements for powder-bed fusion (PBF) and direct energy deposition (DED) AM fabricated parts ranging in size from 100s mm to 1000s mm scale and for materials ranging (in density) from aluminum to tungsten. In Phase I we will develop a conceptual design for the Adaptive, Multi-Energy Computed Tomography system for Large Additively Manufactured Parts (AMECT-LAMP), and demonstrate feasibility with analytical modeling and testing. In Phase II we will develop a prototype AMECT-LAMP, and experimentally verify its performance."

With modern Big Data Collection, the focus has shifted to collecting and storing as much data as possible; even if that data is not immediately identified as useful to the human eye. The intention is to allow predictive algorithms determine which data is useful and to have a massive stash of data in its native format in digital storage forever, ultimately producing end product reports or notifications to the end user. Our true innovation for this effort will be introducing the hadoop cluster framework as the main data center application vice traditional data center approaches that are human-deterministic. The development approach is to oversimplify Plug and Play functionality through: reuse of native interfaces, cost effective scalability, and preservation of stored data via replicated nodes of the hadoop cluster. The resulting automated data repository will enable new non-traditional predictive algorithms to be developed and its results presented to shipboard users while underway and shore site users for specific analysis as required."

PEI will develop structural technologies for building and installing these large conformal arrays to the exterior hull. PEI technology will be expanded to allow conformal sonar arrays on other parts of the ship that will create new opportunities for use of bow and sail structure volumes while improving sonar sensor performance. PEI design will allow easy installation and removal of array sections during the Extended Dry-dock Selected Refit Availability (EDSRA) of a submarine. PEI design of this framework would facilitate the attachment and removal of array sections (modules and VBS) using interlocking features and fasteners. In addition, would also be modular so that the array size could be increased if required. Composite materials are inherently corrosion resistant and can also offer acoustic transparency so as to have minimal impact on sonar performance. Also, since framework and VBS back panels will be designed using composites, the contours\/shapes can be complex and features can be integrated, reducing assembly costs."

        "abstract": "Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electrical equipment is much less expensive than equipment specifically designed for military use, and provides faster integration of advanced capabilities. Since COTS equipment is typically single-phase, it is distributed between the three power lines to balance the current loading. However, it can be difficult to dynamically balance the currents to the 3% required by MIL-STD-1399\/300B, since this depends on the current draws of the individual pieces of equipment at different times.A Power Unbalance Corrector (PUC) can compensate for these dynamic changes, and balance the currents between each phase. One way to design the PUC would be to take in the full power, balanced between the three phases, and deliver it to match each of the phase loads. This PUC would operate at 200 A per line, and would be large, expensive, and inefficient.Instead, there is a better approach. Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) proposes an innovative approach to develop a PUC that will be a fraction of the size, cost, and weight of such a system."

        "abstract": "The Navys submarine fleet uses 3 phase delta power per MIL-STD-1399\/300B. The power distribution system operates most effectively when loading per phase is balanced within 3%. COTS data processing equipment used by the fleet typically needs single phase power, so balancing is achieved by manually assigning COTS items to power phases in a manner that equalizes phase loading. Assigning COTS items to power phases is imperfect and cannot provide load balancing in dynamic shipboard environments where loads on COTS change as the mission changes. A Power Unbalance Corrector (PUC) that automatically corrects unbalance would provide superior operational results. The proposed rack mounted 40 kW PUC accepts power from the submarines power distribution system and uses it to power multiple racks. The PUC automatically compensates up to 12% unbalance presenting a balanced load to the submarines power distribution system. PDAs proposed PUC implementation introduces a novel Bidirectional Inverter circuit that passes the balanced part of the power directly from the source to the load; only the unbalanced power needs to be converted. This approach is more than 95% efficient and provides size, weight, reliability, and cost advantages and meets the SBIR requirements."

The first technology is based upon substrate integrated resonators tuned with solid state varactors. This type of filter technology is anticipated to produce a moderate quality factor while maintaining sub-microsecond tuning speeds. The second filter technology leverages High-Q MEMS RF tuner based filters. This filter technology will produce very High-Q performance at the sacrifice of tuning speeds. The results of the feasibility study will provide the Navy with well-defined tradeoffs for tunable microwave filters in the X-Band and above. A cost analysis of both filter technologies will also provide the Navy a means of determining affordability for use in next generation microwave systems. Furthermore, Indiana Microelectronics will work with Lockheed Martin, our transition partner, to define filter interface specifications and performance specifications to enable in-system testing of the Phase II filter prototypes."

        "abstract": "Submarines have two independent electrical generators to provide continuous power to critical loads. These generators are not coordinated nor synchronized, so switching between them can cause a brief power interruption to the loads. Conventional uninterruptible power supplies can maintain power to critical loads during this switching, but they are much larger and heavier than required, since they are designed to operate for minutes at a time. A small, short-duration supply tailored to this switch-over requirement could replace these conventional supplies, freeing up substantial amounts of space and weight for other capability improvements.Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) proposes to design, build, qualify, and field a short-duration Power Bridge Converter (PBC) meeting the size, power, power-quality, and reliability required for submarine deployment. The system will provide 40 kW of power during a 100 millisecond interruption. It will also limit the inrush current upon reapplication of power, as required by MIL-STD-1399\/300B. Our proposed PBC design uses commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, and can be built from parts that are available today. Keys to the PCBs performance are the high-reliability electrolytic capacitors for energy storage, the circuit architecture, silicon carbide switching transistors, the EMI filter design, and switches that limit inrush current."

        "abstract": "The Navys submarine fleet uses 3 phase delta power per MIL-STD-1399\/300B. The power distribution system is driven from two power busses and automatically transfer loads between the busses when one loses power. During bus transfer, a 70  100 msec power interrupt may occur which can create upset in the loads. PDAs proposed rack mounted 40 kW Power Supply Bridge (PSB) is installed between the power distribution system and the loads to provide power to the loads during the interrupt period hence preventing upset in the loads. The PSB uses a novel Bidirectional Inverter circuit to convert DC energy stored in a capacitor bank to AC to power to the load when power is interrupted, and to efficiently charge the capacitors when power is normal. Precise Sensing &amp; Control is included to direct the operation of the Bidirectional Inverter and the remainder of the PSB circuits in a manner that blocks backflow of current to the power distribution system during interrupt, or excessive inrush currents from the power distribution system at any time. The Bidirectional Inverter approach meets SBIR requirements and provides size, weight, efficiency, reliability, and cost characteristics superior to other alternatives."

Traditional UPS applications are typically not optimized for weight and volume, and utilize bulky lead-acid batteries that provide significantly more energy storage than is needed for naval bus-transfer holdup applications. The proposed converter utilizes wide-bandgap semiconductors and high power density energy storage to enable a significant reduction in weight and volume compared to existing shipboard UPS solutions.

Binocular disparity, occlusion, specular highlights and gradient shading, and other expected depth cues are correct from the viewers perspective as in the natural real-world light-field.Light-field radiance image rendering is the process of rendering all the perspective views present in the light-field from a 3D model regardless of viewer position. To implement multi-view rendering with a GPU requires that the host application dispatch a render pass for each viewpoint (micro-lens) required for the projection system; a light-field projection system may contain thousands of micro-lenses. Ultimately, the size, weight and power requirements (SWaP) requirements of a light-field display are largely a factor of radiance image computation. By removing the OS, CPUs and other PC system components, and refactoring the GPUs to render hogels in parallel, a more SWaP efficient light-field\/multi-view rendering engine can be developed."

The Rainfall Engine is capable of creating 3D visuals in real-time for use in plenoptic projectors, holographic and other light-field displays. It is a host application based on the graphics processor unit (GPU) and has significant advantages over conventional serial and cluster rendering approaches, including improvement in the display update rate while providing reduction in render latency, lag, and SWaP-C (size, weight, power and cost). Additionally, the Rainfall Engine will reduce the size, weight, power and cooling of the required computation cluster, as well as the number of computation components and requirements for long-term maintenance and support. Holochip will refine the LfPU architecture and describe the rendering benefits, paradigms and the associated SWaP-C reductions of the Rainfall Engine compared to off-the-shelf computation. Holochip will define the acceptable display list, draw operations, and describe rendering restrictions or limitations. Feasibility will be established by modeling of the 3D real-time visualization refresh rates as compared with current 2D real-time visualization refresh rates."

        "abstract": "The Navy has the requirement for managing the inventory and safety of its food service products. Cybernet participated in Trident Warrior in 2009 to perform experimentation&apos;s with its ruggedized tablet platform. During this effort, we interviewed galley personnel to understand their requirements related to afloat operations. For them, the areas of paperless operation, recipe management, and food monitoring were of greatest importance. At the time, one of the barriers to implementation was a lack of supporting software that could operate on the hardware. Today, the Food Service Management (FSM) System 3 is available that unifies the logistics and operations of aboard and ashore galley operations, and portable hardware capabilities have increased substantially. Cybernet proposes to leverage past experiences unique to hardware deployment aboard ship, development of rugged platforms, and expertise in process integration to provide the Navy with a hardware\/software solution that supports galley operation and logistics. The proposed system includes a complete logistic solution (hardware, software), accreditation, and integration with FSM."

        "abstract": "The automated identification and processing of goods and documents using machine-readable barcode identifiers is one of the key enabling technologies underlying most modern logistics system. However, the Navys efforts to utilize barcode technology with the Fleet Food Service Management (FSM) system has been often challenged by unique requirements for food service aboard operational vessels, the complexities of procurement, and the need for technologies and processes to comply with policies and regulations such as information assurance instructions and the 2010 Navy Financial Integrity and Audit Readiness mandate. Leveraging its experience in FIAR compliance and information assurance as the prime contractor for the Navys Fleet Audit Compliance Enhancement Tool (FACET), small business Premier Solutions Hi LLC proposes to develop a portable system for barcode identification, automated ordering and inventory, and FIAR compliant document retention that can interface with the Navy FSM 3.0 and other systems to streamline the operation of Navy galleys, stockrooms and messes both afloat and ashore."

        "abstract": "Navy Food Service Management (FSM) systems have enabled 21-day cycle menu planning, receipt control, and inventory management in an efficient and streamlined process. Integral to the FSMs menu development with highly acceptable menu items, is the data collected from a Food Preparation Worksheet, NAVSUP Form 1090, which includes an Armed Force Recipe Services (AFRS) index card for each menu item of the meals. The use of 1090 is, however, a manual and hard copy documentation process that reduces work performance and productivity because of the time required for manual paperwork. This in turn reduces the level and quality of training that can be provided to the CS. CSSUP is a user-centered design-driven mobile application that runs on a ruggedized 12 touch screen device. It is connected to the FSM system to help the CS to prepare food as per menu and recipe, log data and take notes similar to the 1090 form, and learn the food preparation process from step-by-step interactive training aids. CSSUP will encourage a collaborative environment for individual CSs in tracking and learning processes to improve meal acceptability, enabling the team to deliver effective and efficient food preparation services by improving menu acceptability and reducing wastage."

In this study, we propose a high fidelity model based on Virtual Source Concept (VSC) and a fast algorithm based on machine\/supervised learning that is several orders of magnitude faster than deterministic calculations and more relevant to real world problems"

The TIM pad\/film will be designed and tested to ensure no pump-out will occur under vibration, thermal and power\/duty cycling, when utilized in energy storage and power electronics platforms for Navy and other DoD applications. ADAs proposed TIM will be designed to provide effective thermal interface between cells and a battery cooling module developed by our partner for Navy ship and terrestrial applications, including but not limited to next-generation weapons systems. Our TIMs and integration protocols will be designed to integrate with external active cooling loops already utilized by Navy (shipboard and other) battery platforms, ensuring a drop-in replacement requiring minimum assembly complications. We plan to leverage our decade-long expertise in the design, manufacturing and fabrication of TIMs to solve this unique need."

Available TIMs each satisfy a portion of these requirements, but not all of them.Glacigen Materials will develop a new class of TIM by creating a novel composite material. This material will be embodied as a sheet of tailorable thickness with very high through thickness thermal conductivity (exceeding 5000 W\/m2-K), but limited thermal conductivity in-plane. Glacigen will subsequently demonstrate the capacity to engineer in-plane anisotropy where the thermal conductivity along a single direction is favored over other directions. Phase I work will demonstrate the process which enables the unique matrix microstructure with relevant materials and then impregnating the composite matrix with the functional phase. Phase I work will conclude with thermal and mechanical characterization. Phase I option work will demonstrate scaling and engineered anisotropy."

This new capability will provide increased data for assimilation into Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance sensor performance prediction models, as well as weather forecasting. Our payload concept builds on our experience gathered in developing an airborne laser hygrometer payload for the ScanEagle under a DoE project and features in situ measurement of water vapor using a tunable diode laser-based laser hygrometer that provides the required high measurement speed of water vapor and freedom from extractive sampling issues. High speed, highly compact pressure and temperature sensors are also integrated into the payload. The Phase I base program will focus on downsizing the size weight and power of our previous designs, including estimating size reduction in the system electronics to be had using high density interconnect architecture. The base program will create a CAD mechanical model subjected to thermal, structural, and computation flow dynamics modeling. The Phase I option program will validate the base program CFD modeling via testing the payload and spar in a local wind tunnel facility."

Examples of flight measurements show how the method on prototype level can already be used to correct vertical profiles and resolve turbulence spectra up to about 3Hz (humidity) and 4Hz (temperature).

        "abstract": "An object-oriented programming language such as Java is often the developers choice for implementing such applications, primarily due to its quick development cycle, mature ecosystem, and rich community resources. With the feature-rich Java libraries, third party code, and open-source tools that are leveraged to speed up time to market, performance degradation and security can be one of the tradeoffs. Applications include code and libraries that are only partially used, and the exploitable attack surface is much larger than it needs to be. PJR is proposing JArtus, an automated software refactoring tool that allows the user to selectively remove unwanted features and\/or functionality from a Java software product. JArtus will be a desktop software tool that leverages research and novel approaches to using code slicing, and soot frameworks to identify features, unused code, and libraries that can be removed from Java applications. Users will be able to select, or simply press an easy button to refactor the software, and produce a new, smaller, more efficient, more secure version of the original application. JArtus will provide feature and functionality testing, security scanning, and performance metrics for the app before and after the code reduction and refactoring process."

We plan to leverage code pruning techniques to selectively remove application func- tionalities to restrict access without causing the program to terminate and in a manner that is not disruptive, whenever possible. The selective removal of application code enables a system operator or a user to make the applications conform to a customizable security policy.

Current simulations require numerous pucksters to control simulated entities, driving up the manpower costs of conducting simulation-based training. To fulfill the roles of pucksters in simulation-based training environments, Charles River Analytics proposes to design and demonstrate Simulated Teachable Agents for Training Environments (STATE). We will base STATE on two existing capabilities: (1) SAMPLE, our in-house cognitive modeling architecture that implements Kleins model of Recognition-Primed Decision-making (RPD); and (2) AgentWorks, our in-house, intelligent agent development and run-time platform. STATE augments these capabilities with a Graphical Agent Teaching Interface and a suite of Behavior Learning Algorithms to develop and adapt SUDM-related behavior models. The result of the STATE effort will be a suite of tools that empowers a Trainer user base (as opposed to an engineering user base) to rapidly specify, train, and implement new agent behaviors for simulation-based training."

It will yield, on a single shot, the pedestal power and complete pulse spatiotemporal field, E(x,y,z,t)i.e. all possible pulse information, including pulse-shape stability, even if multi-shot operation is required. It will include user-friendly software yielding a highly intuitive color movie of each pulse, allowing monitoring by an essentially untrained operator. It will also provide outputs to control laser and pulse parameters, as desired. It will require minimal electrical power: a single laptop, which powers devices currently sold by Swamp Optics. Specifically, the package will contain a simple, robust, and compact device, called STRIPED FISH, to measure each pulses E(x,y,z,t). It uses a spatially filtered reference pulse, extracted from the test pulse and measured by a well-established, simple, robust, and compact device, called GRENOUILLE. Finally, a novel device will measure the presence of any pedestal present."

        "abstract": "Researchers developing Ultra-Short-Pulse-Lasers (USPLs) need real-time measurements of key parameters, on both single-shot and statistically assessed basis. We propose to design and build a fully integrated, intuitive and user friendly, Live USPL Characterization System, termed LUCS, using novel methods of data capture, data reduction, and distributed processing. Phase I work will evaluate, select, and develop compact, portable individual diagnostics to reliably measure spatial, spectral, temporal, and pulse energy parameters under field conditions. Advanced data reduction algorithms and system architectures will be defined and prototyped. We will also design and optimize a much-needed USPL measurement capability presently unavailable: a single shot phase characterization technique insensitive to both alignment and beam profile, simultaneously providing detailed temporal and phase profiles. A single graphical user interface (GUI) will display user selectable, processed, laser parameters including live tracking of statistical variations in beam figures-of-merit. Additionally, the GUI will allow full control of all diagnostic system components. The GUI will initially run on a laptop and will ultimately be available as a tablet or smartphone app. In Phase II, these prototype components will be fully realized, with diagnostic subsystems seamlessly integrated within hardware and software architectures to provide rapid data processing, enabling 10-Hz live display updates."

Enabling more efficient UUV sonar operation will increase vehicle operational availability. Creare proposes to develop advanced, compact power inductors by commercializing a bulk nanocrystalline advanced core material whose cost-efficient fabrication has recently been demonstrated in an innovative process by our development partner. This core material provides saturation flux capability comparable to silicon steel while maintaining much higher electrical resistivity to reduce eddy current losses. Creare will use this advanced core material to develop compact inductor designs for UUV sonar applications. During Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through numerical analysis and laboratory testing. During Phase II we will refine the advanced core materials magnetic properties through incremental process improvements and fabricate inductors for testing. Creare will leverage our magnetic circuits and power electronics experience, along with the advanced materials capabilities of our development partner, to develop the compact inductor for sonar applications. We anticipate that the inductor development will be at TRL 5 at the conclusion of Phase II."

In addition, a novel winding technique is applied to the new PI design that allows more windings per layer, further decreasing PI size and reducing the PIs stray capacitance. Lowering the PIs stray capacitance extends the PIs bandwidth and minimizes its distortion level."

        "abstract": "Nickel aluminum bronze alloys (NAB) have been used extensively in sea-water applications where high strength, high toughness and high corrosion resistance are required. To date, there have been very few attempts to extend AM to NAB. The traditional composition of NAB, UNS C95800 containing 9.5% aluminum, 5% nickel, 4.5% iron and remaining copper, is slow cooled and precipitation strengthened and may pose difficulties while processing using techniques that involve rapid heating and cooling. Using computational approaches, it is possible to optimize the NAB composition that is amenable to AM without the loss of the mechanical and corrosion properties due to the formation of unwelcomed phases such as 2. The aim of this project proposed by Universal Technology Corporation (UTC) is to develop modelling tool based on the finite element and phase field approach to optimize the NAB composition. The input data for developing the computational tool will be generated by producing test coupons via SLM of NAB alloyThe Phase I option will demonstrate the feasibility of using the NAB composition optimized using the computational tool as the feedstock to build the test coupons and study them for their mechanical and corrosion behavior."

However, the supply chain for the large, complex castings needed for the many Navy platforms is severely limited. Additive Manufacturing (AM) promises to be an innovative technology that can enable rapid manufacturing of complex parts at greatly reduced cycle time and with greatly enhanced production flexibility. The market currently lacks NAB feedstocks for AM processing with established best practices and known material performance, which limits the adoption of AM for the manufacturing of Naval seawater components. In this Phase I SBIR program, QuesTek Innovations LLC, a leader in the field of integrated computational materials engineering, is partnering with Pennsylvania State University to develop a new NAB feedstock optimized for the unique processing conditions of AM. QuesTek is uniquely suited to rapidly designing new feedstocks optimized for AM using its advanced Materials by Design stage-gate alloy development process, which is based upon mechanistic models to predict key process-structure and structure-property relationships. Technical feasibility of the developed feedstock will be demonstrated in Phase I with directed energy deposition build trials and coupon-scale property validation."

        "abstract": "Point-to-point Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication systems have been demonstrated and are commercially available. FSO systems have many desirable attributes for Navy vessels and aircraft, especially their ability to operate without RF emissions and their immunity to RF interference and jamming. However, to achieve widespread use in naval applications, a more advanced communication network is required, with the ability to simultaneously communicate between multiple ships and aircraft.To address this need, SA Photonics proposes the development of our MultiEye FSO communication system. The MultiEye system utilizes technology and systems developed or being developed on multiple Navy and Air Force programs to provide simultaneous high data rate communication between multiple Navy ships and Aircraft. MultiEye will utilize SA Photonics field proven technology for atmospheric on-the-move FSO systems. MultiEye consists of a multi-beam shipboard FSO terminal as well as individual terminals for aircraft and rotorcraft."

Single beam free space optical communication allows high-speed point-to-point data links. However, an optical terminal with two or more beams can act as a communications relay allowing the construction of optical communications networks. With this in mind, the Navy is funding the development of a multi-beam transmit\/receive capability that can be deployed on USN\/USMC platforms. The Navy has requested a terminal with at least two independently directed links which would allow the formation of a ring network, with up to as many as four independent terminals, to allow the construction of self-forming mesh networks."

At the front of the list of barriers is developing a better understanding of the origination of defects and how microstructures evolve throughout the process. To that end, UES, Inc. has assembled a team consisting of North Carolina State University and CalRAM, Inc. to investigate the role of process parameters and part orientation on part quality through coupling experimental characterization and process simulation. We propose to design a component with complex features which resemble a heat exchanger, manufacture multiple parts using electron-beam powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, characterize and quantify the microstructure and defects, and couple the experimental results to a thermomechanical model. By integrating a parametric study on process parameters, rapid characterization, and simulation we aim develop a toolset for designers and manufacturers that will increase first part yield and help streamline the qualification process."

        "abstract": "The research objective of this proposal is to demonstrate feasibility of a solidification science based Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) that combines computational heat, mass transfer, fluid flow and mechanics simulations with thermodynamic and kinetic models to enable cellular automata (CA) framework. Its purpose is to link the AM laser power bed process parameters with as-built microstructure including phase selection, material inhomogeneities, and the potential for the occurrence of porosity and lack-of-fusion defects. The ICME prediction of 3-D distributions of the thermal gradient (G), interface velocity (R) and the melt pool fluid flow would be utilized as input to the calculation of constitutional supercooling and the columnar-to-equiaxed transition. The dynamics of solidification interface velocity will be modeled using interface response function theories to compute the inhomogeneities caused by phase selection phenomena in metals and alloys. The evolution of the solidification front will be traced within the CA grid to predict the overall solidification grain morphology and texture. ICME will be utilized to detect and\/or mitigate the presence of material inhomogeneities. Deposition trials will be performed for two stainless steel alloys to demonstrate the applicability of the solidification based calculation of site-specific microstructure."

        "abstract": "Delivering contextual data via an Augmented Reality (AR) wearable shows promise in accelerating tactical decision making while enhancing situational awareness for dismounted soldiers in call-for-fire scenarios. The military can leverage commercialized industrial solutions like the DAQRI Smart Helmet (DSH), an AR platform that provides a transparent optical display with state-of-the-art performance specifications in a comfortable, durable, user-friendly form factor operational in full daylight. The DSH can be cost-effectively upgraded to provide USMC Ground Forces with an advanced tool for enhancing decision making and situational awareness. Our proposed DAQRI Augmented Reality Situational Awareness and Decision Support Synthetic Vision System (DARSADS SVS) combines the existing DAQRI AR platform (DSH) with Lockheeds current Wide Area Augmented Reality (WAAR) project which integrates with target designation system KILSWITCH, enabling a seamless transition from training to battlefield operations.DARSADS SVS provides a foundation for prototyping information visualizations informed by experimentally validated cognitive models such as Salience, Effort (inhibition), Expectancy, Value (SEEV) capable of predicting attention tunneling. Our tactical, real-time AR decision support will incorporate the lessons learned from decades of aviation HUD design research to mitigate attention and perception limitations thanks to our collaboration with the premier expert in the field, Dr. Chris Wickens."

        "abstract": "Mixed Reality (MR) technologies can create realistic and engaging learning environments by merging real and computer-generated elements into a single space. However, the use of such technologies does not guarantee effective learning. In fact, the inappropriate selection or implementation of technologies can hinder learning (Appleman, 2005; Bransford, 2000). Unfortunately, there are no design support tools to assist military Instructional Systems Designers (ISDs) in choosing learning strategies that fully leverage the affordances  and offset the limitations  associated with different types of MR learning technologies. To address this critical gap, Aptima will develop the Automating Design Decisions for MIxed Reality Learning Environments (ADDMIRE) system, which will provide ISDs with practical design and implementation guidance that will (1) maximize their pedagogical value, (2) minimize the amount of extraneous cognitive load, and (3) suggest the most appropriate measures for assessing proficiency, learning, and transfer. As part of the ADDMIRE system, Subject Matter Expert (SME) experiential knowledge and insights will be collected and linked to best practices from the published literature. The result will be a robust and extensible framework for designing MR learning environments across a wide range of Naval jobs and job families."

        "abstract": "An area in dire need of training innovation is that of ship maintenance, which represents one of the Navys most acute readiness concerns. Reduced crew ships such as the LCS\/Frigate and the CVN-78 provide inherently fewer opportunities for On the Job Training (OJT) due to the limited number of maintainers aboard each ship and limited time available for existing maintainers to dedicate to training on ship. Additionally, naval ship maintenance subject matter experts are retiring, with no mechanisms in place to transfer their tacit knowledge to future sailors.Design Interactive (DI) proposes to develop and validate 1) a Mixed reality Adaptive Scaffolding Tool for Enhancing Readiness (MASTER) to support engineering maintenance training, namely troubleshooting skills, and 2) an EXpertise TRansfer, Analytics, and Content Tagging (EXTRACT) tool to embed instructional strategies from SMEs within training environments. This will provide a scientifically grounded methodology for developing 2 testbed systems: a classroom-based VR system and an Augmented Reality tool for OJT and job support. The combined MASTER and EXTRACT capabilities will integrate with existing and emergent mixed reality platforms to provide military training organizations with a pedagogically grounded approach to improving warfighter readiness and performance throughout the training continuum, from desks to decks."

There are many factors that these watch standers use to draw their conclusions. Everything from weather to recent hostilities can affect their decision making. An opportunity exists to create an automatic tool for assessing theater-wide ASW situations by leveraging state of the art expert systems technology to assist the TASW Battle Watch Captain. Discovery Machine, Inc. (DMI) in partnership with Arorae Corporation (together the DMI team) proposes to leverage the DM Knowledge Service Modeler (KSM) to create a TASW console. The DM Knowledge Service Modeler is an open and extensible architecture based on artificial intelligence and knowledge capture software. Our research has resulted in technology that enables subject matter experts (SMEs) to capture and deploy their own expertise into decision support systems resulting in better automation and increased performance of personnel. DMI&apos;s technology does not require the experts to write code. It builds on how SMEs currently assess a situation, and applies expertise to automate and assist."

Hard data, such as threat submarine historical tracks and operating characteristics including transit and maximum speed, can be easily converted to locational information. Soft data requires consolidation and conversion using ontologically-based rule sets and fuzzy logic\/machine learning to transform data, such as the tension level, with the threat country to create a set of plausible target tracks based on this information. The adaptive filter will output a heat map to indicate the likelihood of future locations for the threat submarine."

In contrast to 2D ISAR imaging or other published InISAR work, our approach provides true 3D metric measurements and true cross-range scale, independently of the knowledge of the motion profile of the target. This enables a host of novel features to be extracted from InISAR imagery and used to improve target classification performance and eliminate the template explosion issue of conventional multi-view radar ATR. In Phase I we will (1) demonstrate feasibility of InISAR using realistic simulated data, flight trajectories, and maritime target motions and show the accuracy with which true 3D target measurements and pose can be determined, (2) quantify improvement in ATR performance due to inclusion of 3D target measurements, and (3) develop the CONOPS for this new imaging modality in the operational context. In Phase II we will implement the algorithms in a real-time processor and demonstrate operation in a field test. We have identified Raytheon SAS as a transition partner and are including their letter of support."

An approach to obtaining additional features from ISAR imaging to further enhance classification performance is to exploit multiple transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) phase centers. Interferometric ISAR operation is the most basic Tx-Rx architecture comprised of a single Tx phase center and two displaced Rx phase centers. This architecture allows for ISAR images to be formed from the individual Tx-Rx pairs, and subsequently combine them to form a phase interferogram. Our proposed effort satisfies the objectives and is synergistic with related transition activities."

Comparing the current state of the art for FESS to chemical energy storage generally leads to the conclusion that FESS offers major advantages for high power and high cycle life applications and for load-leveling power demand transients to shield electrical grids from high power demand spikes. BT-CEMs previous efforts studying low loss bearings for flywheels concluded that an HTSMB can provide the lowest system level losses but will require a reliable damping solution. Our teams proprietary controlled damping approach, which achieves full rotordynamic stability with very low (strategically placed) forces and very low losses, only incurs losses when damping is required. ONRs Combat Hybrid Power System (CHPS) is a primary example of leading edge technology for shipboard MW-class flywheel load-leveling systems. The CHPS machine will serve as the focus application for our teams HTSMB-CD development efforts. Our team proposes to fully develop this design for a CHPS type application as the result of this Phase I effort."

To accomplish these goals our team will draw on currently funded and previously funded Navy experiences in the design\/ analysis\/ fabrication of structures, composite\/ metallic shipboard systems and shipboard integration to Navy performance and ship schedule requirements. Following design and manufacture, Phase II testing is required to verify that the FES meets dynamic performance requirements. In addition, there are thermal, shipboard geometric, design specific variables and other mechanical\/environmental challenges to be met before completion of a shipboard FES is realized. To meet these design goals, KaZaK is proposing several low cost, lightweight designs.

Our objective is to deliver continuous 3D model generation of urban environments in an ultra-low SWaP form factor to help improve the Navys ability to model and understand urban environments through both direct manipulation of the models themselves and through correlated processing with other intelligence layers within a data fusion framework. Our capabilities for 3D modeling-based from aerial video processing will be advanced using recent developments in the field of computer vision and subsequently optimized and physically characterized within an embedded computing environment. We believe in the benefits of a phased approach for SWaP minimization. EMPIRE Phase I will pursue optimization, porting, and evaluation in a set of low-power COTS GPU embedded systems. Further work will see refinement of the 3D urban modeling pipeline, adding support for multiple sensors while further trimming \/ focusing computation."

This includes techniques for optimally combining the information and features from monostatic ISAR with multi-static ISAR images and incorporating them into Maritime Classification Aids (MCA) and radar Resource Manager (RM) that are currently transitioning to naval surveillance radars. Multi-static imaging has both challenges and opportunities. Besides the advantage of covert receiver platforms , additional opportunities include diverse illumination and viewing geometries expanding the information degrees of freedom that can provide richer information for target identification. Unique differences in scattering as a function of bistatic angle may be used as discriminating features and target pose angles can be estimated."

While this reduces the threat to those platforms in A2AD environments, it also greatly expands the degrees of freedom a template-based classification database must encompass. The overhead and logistics burdens in maintaining such a database are immense, particularly since ISAR templates should also encompass the variety of typical vessel motions. EMSI proposes to extend its monostatic 3D ISAR technology to bistatic and multistatic systems, thereby extracting vessel features that allow classification with existing Navy monostatic databases, while requiring only short dwells on target."

Both the control systems as well as the radio equipment contain proprietary components, which make maintenance difficult and expensive due to lack of vendor competition. We are proposing a modular and non-proprietary hardware and software architecture that will consolidate the three control systems into one, as well as simplify the radio communication equipment. The proposed system is centered around integration of Software Defined Radio (SDR) functionality into the control system and leveraging a plugin-based software architecture that allows decoupling of specific hardware from the rest of the control system. This approach will enable the government to utilize commodity COTS hardware not only for the control system, but potentially for the radio equipment as well, offering a path to long-term affordable sustainment for this critical communication system."

        "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) technology is becoming more popular for the fabrication of 3D metal products as it offers rapid prototyping and large design freedom. However, part quality and fatigue performance of components fabricated by current AM technology are not comparable to that produced by traditional methods. Post-build processing techniques, such as heat treatment (HT) and Hot Iso-static Pressing (HIP), have been developed to improve microstructure and remove internal flaws that are detrimental to fatigue resistance. In order to simulate the HT and HIP process and optimize the post-build process, an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering approach is utilized to link the process parameters with materials structures, properties and fatigue performance. We propose a unified computational package to (1) simulate the HT\/HIP process including the physics of fluid flow, heat transfer, microstructure evolution and residual stress formation, and (2) predict the probabilistic distribution of fatigue life of AM components. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art hybrid optimization approach, combining sensitivity analysis, response surface method and genetic algorithm, is proposed to optimize post-build process parameters to minimize porosity and defects. Ultimately, the software developed will optimize the HT\/HIP process for an AM part CAD\/CAE model provided by the user."

AM produced materials are highly susceptible to fatigue due to presence of large number of pores and defect, limiting its use in fatigue critical applications. Without a proper understanding of how HT\/HIP affects the microstructural features that cause fatigue failure, optimization of fatigue performance and hence the use of AM built parts in fatigue critical application will be limited.Under this SBIR program, QuesTek Innovations LLC will utilize its knowledge and expertise in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) to assemble a suite of modeling tools capable of optimizing Additive Manufacturing (AM) post-build processes of metal parts for fatigue performance, without deteriorating other mechanical properties. As a leader in ICME and a pioneer in development of processing-structure-property models and ICME databases, QuesTek is uniquely qualified to extend its modeling capabilities to simulate porosity reduction, microstructural evolution and its effect on mechanical properties, residual stress and distortion as a function of heat treatment parameters."

        "abstract": "One of the most challenging tasks for a naval aviator is to land a rotorcraft on a ship, the dynamic interface task. The pilot experiences variable wind environments, often degraded visual conditions, and a landing area that is moving in response to sea state. Creating a representative simulator-based testing and training environment for dynamic interface has also proven challenging. While existing technologies can provide motion cueing, the limitations of these devices can negatively impact effectiveness. To achieve a more effective body force cueing environment, the nature of the forces experienced by pilots in the critical dynamic interface flight regime must first be better understood. Then and only then can the cueing mechanisms be properly created new or reimagined from existing designs to produce the desired results in the simulator. A team led by Systems Technology, Inc. proposes to fully characterize the dynamic environment at the pilot station. A validated pilot biodynamic model will then be used to evaluate the impact of flight generated body forces versus simulated force cueing on the dynamic interface task. The critical body force cueing elements identified in this approach will be used to define candidate hardware solutions to be developed and tested in Phase II."

Continuum Dynamics, Inc. (CDI) proposes to develop a model-based pilot-centric framework for the development and analysis of rotorcraft motion\/force cueing systems with emphasis on shipboard operations. This model-based approach will combine high-fidelity aerodynamic models to characterize the rotorcraft operating environment and human perception models to develop and implement optimal cueing strategies. The approach can be used to evaluate an existing motion system quantitatively to assess motion cue fidelity and to integrate additional cueing hardware (e.g., dynamic motion seat) to enhance realism and improve effectiveness of the virtual environment. In Phase I, the pilot-centric motion\/body force cueing framework will be developed, and framework sub-models will be evaluated and benchmarked. The methodology will be tested and evaluated using a representative tiltrotor simulation with G-seat to provide body force cues. Results from Phase I will provide a foundation for further development and evaluation within the NAVAIR V-22 simulator as part of follow-on activities."

RAST has been used on many programs and is the predecessor to: AFRLs Strategic Radar Simulation RLSTAP; Knowledge-Based STAP (KBSTAP); and other Air Force and DARPA tools.This Phase 1 effort will: determine the level of fidelity (number of scatterers, scattering coefficients, scattering geometries, Internal Clutter Motion (ICM), clutter density) required to fully represent clutter environments as well as decorrelation and mismatch induced by the radar hardware and motion of the platform and the antenna rotation that impacts the STAP performance; develop the Phase 2 prototype architecture to support real-time T&amp;E environments with RF clutter injection; and address increasing processing speeds by prototyping processing intensive algorithms in CUDA based Graphics Processing Units."

        "abstract": "STR proposes the development of a high-fidelity UHF radar clutter data simulation environment, leveraging existing simulation code adapted to the UHF E-2D application for the purposes of direct injection into a radar simulator. Several prior programs at STR have developed radar signal processing algorithms for airborne MTI applications that have included A\/D level clutter simulators. On this program, we will incorporate unique effects for UHF applications, to include parameterization of number of scatterers per range\/Doppler cell, clutter reflectivity statistics and characteristics of broad range of clutter environments (e.g., maritime or land clutter). In addition, radar sensor attributes (motion, digitization, etc.) and platform effects will be included. An MTI processing chain model that includes space-time adaptive processing (STAP) will also be developed to validate details of the clutter model and to benchmark expected performance in the NAVAIR Architecture Management Integration Environment (AMIE). Along with the clutter modeling code to be developed in Phase I, STR will develop a plan to transition the code to real-time implementation prototyping. With extensive experience in radar clutter modeling, STAP algorithm development and direct development experience for the E-2D system, STR is uniquely qualified for the UHF clutter modeling for airborne surveillance radar project."

With no built in logic to manage the storage volume, a first-in-first-out default overwrite situation often results, which hampers mission planning or results in planners having to expend time manually searching external libraries for needed imagery. Sonalysts proposed Mission-Focused Imagery Selection Tool (M-FIST) will provide a software technology solution to allow planners to use a user-friendly geographical interface to identify mission requirements based on locations, image type, image age, and multiple photogrammetric properties. These requirements are then compared with metadata extracted from both previously stored and incoming imagery feeds to determine in real-time the most relevant imagery to accept and\/or delete from the exploitation systems storage volume. M-FIST will provide system operators with a dynamic intuitive interface that includes a representation of the user-defined requirements, existing imagery, and a depiction of how well existing imagery meets mission needs."

Ability to retrieve relevant imagery and retain these data sets for exploitation drastically improves the Navys ability to conduct Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance operations. Current imagery management systems do not account for users query and metadata filtering priorities, which can lead to loss of valuable imagery data as onboard storage capacity becomes limited. DZYNE Technologies proposes to develop the Smart Caching of Imagery for Carry On System (SCICOS) that leverages our experience in data management and image and metadata content extraction to provide a scalable imagery management system. We propose a data retention strategy (imagery caching) that leverages the users query and persistence rules to rank imagery priority. The SCICOS system handles imagery retention automatically based on users interaction and configuration of the persistence rule set, which allows the user to focus on their mission operations. The proposed effort will develop an end-to-end solution that supports (a) intuitive query and filter selection of imagery by metadata; (b) an automated imagery retention based on users usage and persistence rule definition; (c) a scalable framework for imagery management that automatically extracts metadata and imagery content to increase rapid search and retrieval."

Specifically, the innovation in high bandwidth mechanical actuators and lightweight mirror design will allow for the correction of atmospheric and aero-optic effects, as well as support the internal weapon optical train alignment maintenance for future fast-mover airborne missions. This integrated system offers significantly enhanced operating bandwidth and accelerations in a small footprint. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the RAMS technology through design, fabrication, and demonstration of the system prototype. In Phase II, POC plans to advance, optimize, and ruggedize the RAMS assembly to meet the Navys operational requirements."

Furthermore, the turbulent air flow induced by the aircraft can cause light propagating through it to become aberrated due to the aero-optical disturbances. These aero-optical and aero-mechanical disturbances have a strong effect on the pointing of the light propagated through them. The speed of these effects is much higher than normal atmospheric aberrations. Current fast steering mirror (FSM) technology cannot achieve the high bandwidths required for adequate compensation. In this effort we propose to develop a high speed FSM capable of improved compensation based on our successful work developing other aero-optical compensation systems over the last 10 years."

        "abstract": "Military aircraft uses decoy flares to counter incoming threat missiles. Improvement in sensors and guiding mechanisms of missiles requires countermeasures to become more sophisticated to mislead them. One approach to enhance flare performance is through the introduction of multiple spectral characteristics in one device. Such functionally graded flare grains would have the ability to generate specific electromagnetic signatures in time and space. Lynntech proposes to use Additive Manufacturing (commonly known as 3D printing) for fabrication of hybridized flare grains. Our approach involves modification of currently used pyrotechnic compositions to allow their processing via additive manufacturing as well as the design of smart nozzle geometries to allow fabrication of core-shell flare grains. The developed material\/printer combination will allow for fabrication of selectively tuned spectral signatures and inside-out burning characteristics that are not attainable by traditional pyrotechnic pellet production methods such as melt cast, melt cure, and powder pressing. We will evaluate the performance of the fabricated flare grains as a function of composition and energetic payload. The developed technology will allow for precise control of material layering and electromagnetic signature as a function of time. Ultimately, Lynntechs deposition method formulation will result in transformational changes in the performance of decoy flares."

        "abstract": "Flares are commonly used in the defense industry as light utilizing functionally-graded energetic materials for airborne expendable countermeasure applications. However, current flare production processes are rudimentary because they limit design flexibility and incur significant start up and maintenance costs due to low annual production volume. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a superior alternative to traditional flare casting methods because it is production-volume independent and allows control over mesoscale geometry with multiple energetic materials. SAS has been internally conducting State-of-the-Art advanced energetics AM research since 2015 and has used energetic feedstock to successfully 3D print ammonium perchlorate composite propellant solid rocket motors. During Phase I SAS will expand its energetics AM capabilities to allow 3D printing of 25g flare pellets using at least three different energetic materials with unique electromagnetic signatures. The Phase I Option program incorporates flare modeling software development and hot-fire testing and results analysis of 3D printed flares. Johns Hopkins University Energetics Research Group has been enlisted to provide energetic material research support and structural characterization of the 3D printed flare grains."

        "abstract": "Recent development of unmanned vehicles (UVs) demands for new technologies on tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers with ultra-low noise level, reduced size and weight. The sensitivity and noise level of traditional tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers are limited by the intrinsic noise of magnetic materials. And their size and weight are limited by their bulky magnetic cores. The objective of this proposal is to develop tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers using single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) films to reach an ultra-low magnetic noise of ~10fT\/Hz1\/2 , which is ~3 orders of magnitude better than the state of the art tri-axial fluxgate products. This outstanding performance of our proposed fluxgate magnetometers will be achieved by several innovations in this project: (a) development of low-noise magnetic material YIG, (b) design and fabrication of the YIG film with quasi-elliptic edge profile, and (c) rotational excitation mode. The electronic circuits integrated on one board will drive the rotating magnetic field at the frequency of 1650-1700 Hz, detect the single with digitization bit depth of 24 bits, control the measurement, and communicate with UVs. The weight and dimension of the package will be much better than the specifications in the project topic of 2.0lbs. and 8.0in respectively. The compact fluxgate magnetometer."

        "abstract": "Technology advances have produced a class of unmanned vehicles (UVs) that operate in air, on the ground, and underwater. These platforms are ideal for remote sensing because they are small, lightweight, fast, and covert. There is ongoing interest in integrating SIGINT sensor packages onto these platforms.One disadvantage to these small platforms is that they are easily buffeted about by environmental conditions (waves, wind, etc.), and this presents a challenge to low frequency electromagnetic (EM) sensors. This motion-induced signal becomes clutter, or noise, in the data, which overwhelms signals of interest.There is a need for high sensitivity, low frequency magnetic sensors for long range SIGINT on UVs. These sensors must have motion isolation and large dynamic range to sense small long-range signals atop large motion-induced signals. QUASAR Federal Systems (QFS) is a world leader in advanced electromagnetic sensing. That expertise includes a patent for an integrated, 3-axis, fluxgate\/induction sensor. QFS also has extensive experience integrating sensors on both airborne and underwater platforms, and we have implemented multiple motion cancellation techniques into sensor systems we have developed. Here, QFS proposes a lightweight, low power, low magnetic signature, 3-axis fluxgate for UV platforms with active (and possibly passive) motion cancellation."

        "abstract": "Spatial Disorientation (SD) is cited as a contributing factor in five to ten percent of all aviation incidents; and has a 90% fatality rate (Heinle &amp; Ercoline, 2002). SD impacts both fixed- and rotor-wing aviators, and SD impacts pilots at every skill level. To combat SD, aviation training provides exposure to SD materials at multiple points in the training process, including classroom-based instruction and full-motion flight simulators. Availability for hardware systems, however, limit the SD exposure an aviator can have (Ercoline, 1997). Enhancing classroom-based SD instruction into more engaging visual formats is a potential solution to augment SD training. Soar Technology, Inc. proposes a playback-generation tool for Training Wing Mishap Awareness Narratives (WingMAN). WingMAN will allow an instructor to gather data from multiple sources to create a visual playback of any mishap for which data is available, including editing existing playbacks. At the end of Phase II, WingMAN will also support automating the integration of aircraft state data, incident audio recordings, and text-based information. WingMAN will support playback via a first-person 3D out-the-window visualizer, will support exporting narrative playbacks to a variety of formats suitable for delivery on desktops, mobile devices, and in Virtual Reality headsets."

        "abstract": "While relatively infrequent, aviation mishaps can be devastating due to the high probability of loss of life and financial ramifications of such events. Factors such as spatial disorientation and lack of situational awareness are known root causes to aviation mishaps and, unfortunately, training for coping with such factors is generally lacking. To work towards a solution of this significant challenge, the Aptima team proposes to develop a Mishap Awareness Scenario Training for Ensuring Readiness (MASTER). The result will be a tool that allows Naval aviation instructors to create mishap scenarios from realistic data or through intuitive creation tools and will provide multiple methods for media export. The MASTER system will enhance training efficacy by providing multiples methods of immersive mishap replay along with a dedicated plan for evaluating the effectiveness of various training media. An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will also be performed to examine the best possible methods for training delivery. In summary, the anticipated components of the proposed system will work to streamline scenarios authoring and provide revised training for typical aviation mishap factors through immersive and realistic training scenarios."

        "abstract": "Spatial disorientation (SD) and loss of situational awareness (SA) contribute to nearly a third of military aviation mishaps, posing a serious threat to military aircrews worldwide. Current approaches to mitigate mishaps due to SD and loss of SA traditionally focus on instructor-led classroom teaching that introduces aviation and sensory physiology. However, to more effectively explain human contributions and system failures in mishap events, Naval Aviation Survival Training Center (NASTC) personnel require dedicated support to rapidly and intuitively recreate past mishap events, and then distribute training materials based on these recreations into classrooms, exposing students to actual SA\/SD mishap events in a controlled, simulated environment. To address these needs, we propose to design and demonstrate a System for Analyzing Flight-data to Enrich Mishap Awareness Training Tools and Enhance Readiness (SAFE-MATTERS). SAFE-MATTERS will provide mishap awareness training support via three key components: (1) a library of contributing environment, aircraft, mission, and pilot factors relevant to SA\/SD mishaps; (2) an intuitive simulator engine user interface to enable rapid mishap scenario authoring and customization; and (3) an application that supports both the creation and distribution of a range of training media to classrooms."

        "abstract": "Laser-based anti-aircraft missile countermeasure systems use precisely aimed lasers to thwart the attack of these deadly missiles. In a matter of seconds, these systems must detect and characterize the threat, acquire the target, achieve track lock on the target, and initiate engagement of the threat&apos;s seeker with an in-band laser. The survival of our Warfighters and their aircraft during this extremely short engagement time envelope depends upon the near instantaneous application of laser energy with the proper beam characteristics required to defeat the threat. Given this critical performance requirement, the laser&apos;s performance must be verified throughout its entire operational lifespan--from initial integration and checkout of the system in the aircraft, through aircrew training and proficiency, to periodic operational performance verification. Tau Technologies has developed a modular, adaptable laser target board design concept that can provide precision laser measurement and characterization for these critical systems. The target board can be reconfigured to provide detection of various laser wavelengths. Detector modules can be positioned in various geometries and quantities on a backplane, providing enhanced beam detection capabilities. The target board concept includes a tracker source to stimulate the laser system under test, and an integrated location and orientation determination system."

The LTAB, along with the support equipment, will comprise the Portable Integrated Laser Optical Test System, PILOTS. DHPCs approach is to combine and significantly enhance the Navys two legacy measurement subsystems, into a single, safe, and easily deployable trailered system. PILOTS will provide an innovated method for laser measurement, while providing operator comfort, advanced processing and advanced communications for remote operation. Initial focus will be on measuring IRCMs ability to achieve Power on Dome and collecting a Direct Measurement of its laser beam at relevant ranges (1-10 km). PILOTS will be designed to measure the laser parameters (irradiance, beam shape, pointing accuracy, etc.) at any remote outdoor real world range environment (semi rugged). Additionally, PILOTS will include a Laser Characterization Cart (LCC), whose purpose is to quantify the laser radiation characteristics as it exits the systems pointer\/tracker assembly, PILOTS will be designed in an open, modular fashion to address growth paths to allow testing of other types of laser-based systems across the spectra in the future."

The solicitation authors want a robust tool that completely defines the 3-D RF environment and performs multiple types of spatial availability analysis, while facilitating use by individuals that do not possess a deep knowledge of RF propagation theory. Barron Associates, Inc., proposes development of the Spatial Link Analysis for Airborne Platforms (SLAAP) software tool, which will address the myriad facets of a complex electromagnetic modeling problem. A key innovation will be the ability to incorporate 3-D antenna patterns and dynamic aircraft orientation to produce a complete spatial analysis of RF coverage. The result of the proposed work will be a user-friendly GUI that incorporates the various aspects of the modeling problem, permitting easy study setup and generating, as output, 3-D visualizations that are easy to manipulate and consume. Phase I deliverables include use case demonstration, documentation of propagation models and algorithms utilized in Phase I and under consideration for Phase II, preliminary GUI layouts, and the roadmap to product transition to the fleet."

A strong emphasis is placed on dynamic scenarios with moving vehicles, and analysis to determine link availability over large regions. The full modeling suite allows for tradeoffs between fidelity and run time, supporting all relevant parts of the problem, including support for built-in antennas or detailed 2D or 3D antenna gain patterns from external computation electromagnetic codes. The basic methodology is presented for the graphical user interface, with a task outlined to evaluate alternatives and determine specific tools and approaches for the final product.

Preliminary studies have identified that poor vibro-acoustic performance of the HGU-68\/P helmet in the frequency range of E-2D operation may be the root cause. Skyward proposes a solution leveraging high-fidelity computational simulation to predict the HGU-68\/P vibro-acoustic performance and physics-based multidisciplinary optimization to explore design alternatives and potential solutions to reduce sound pressure levels and dynamic excitations experienced by the wearer. Efforts will include 3D scanning to capture helmet geometry, creation of high fidelity structural-acoustic finite element (FE) model of the helmet in the E-2D environment, validation of the model against experimental testing to reduce uncertainty in the computational models, and design optimization to explore solutions. The Phase I effort will produce a high-fidelity, experimentally validated computational model of the helmet, as well as multiple options for design modifications to reduce noise intensity and helmet accelerations, which can be explored in Phase II."

High-fidelity ANSYS FE models of the helmet composite shell including foamed liner components will be developed and used to predict structural resonance frequencies and mode shapes as well as shell vibration and ear noise levels for point and distributed pressure loads on the shell. Helmet testing on an artificial head utilizing modal and transfer function analyses will be used to characterize the helmet dynamic response to point force and distributed pressure loads, to provide validation of the FE models and to identify, along with the FE models, whether shell resonance amplifies tonal cockpit noise\/vibration components. The FE models will be used in Phase II to optimize mitigation approaches that reduce pilot exposure, including structural modification of the shell and enhanced helmet and liner sound attenuation. Other approaches such as tuned vibration absorbers on the shell and active control strategies will also be evaluated for potential effectiveness and feasibility."

This frequency overlaps with vibrational modes of the standard fixed-wing aircrew helmet, the HGU-68\/P. As a combined result, E-2D pilots are experiencing exceptionally large vibrational and acoustic (noise) loading, potentially compromising aircrew performance and mission success. Targeted improvements to the helmet system are needed to mitigate this issue. Creare proposes to apply our validated approach to solving vibro-acoustic problems and modify the HGU-68\/P to reduce its vibrational and acoustic response around the E-2D BPF. This improved Flight Head and Hearing Protection System (FHHPS) will result is less pilot fatigue and noise exposure, enabling longer missions with greater chance of success."

        "abstract": "Noisy cockpits lead to higher workload during flight, compromised radio communications and excessive fatigue in pilots post flight. Excessive noise in cockpit also results in a temporary shift of the auditory threshold known as a Temporary Threshold Shift(TTS). At low frequencies, the helmet itself starts resonating at the characteristic frequency of the helmet close to the excitation source frequency such as BPF. This causes the ear cups to break seal with the pilots head and subject the pilot to excessive noise. The existing Communications earplug and active noise reduction technology cannot eliminate the helmet vibration. Therefore there is a need for new a technology reduce resonating helmet noise. We propose to develop a Magnetorheological Active Damper with Linear Resonating Actuator(MAD-LRA) and Magnetorheological Impact Foams(MIF) for mitigation of helmet vibration. There are two key innovations; one, is to integrate magnetorheological damping along with existing Linear Resonance Actuator(LRA) to develop an active damper with tunable damping force and frequency; two, to use state-of-the-art Magnetorheological Impact Foam(MIF) pads for passive damping using magnetic sheets creating light weight MIF damping pads for effective passive damping at selected locations. Combination of these active and passive damping will provide effective mitigation of helmet vibration during flight."

        "abstract": "The Navy has identified the need for an epoxyless fiber optic ferrule and associated connector housing, and mating adapter, for optical fibers designed for transmission from 2-10 microns in wavelength. The primary application for epoxyless mid-infrared (MWIR) fiber connector technology is the PMA-272 Directed Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM) program and a secondary application is at-a-distance chemical and biological agent sensors. Other Navy applications of epoxyless low loss fiber optic connector technology, when used with other types of optical fiber, include high energy fiber laser weapons, platform interconnects, and tethers for towed arrays and undersea weapons. nPP proposes to offer epoxyless metallic ferrules optimized for laser sources in the MWIR, capable of running at the required powers and power densities (100 W, 10 GW\/cm2) that are MIL-STD810G and AS6021 compliant. Aiding the ability to withstand these powers is that the ferrule will be metallic, and so will act as a combined radiative and thermally conductive heat sink reducing the temperature rise of the fiber, something the ceramic ferrules cannot do effectively. The need for and design of a custom heat-sinking connector housing and adaptor with optimized thermal properties that mate the two ferrules ends together will be investigated, and designed if required."

        "abstract": "The Navys Multi-Static Active Coherent (MAC) system is a multi-static sonar system deployed in the ocean from an aircraft used for wide area search. Surface-drifting buoys are dropped at pre-determined locations and then drift with the currents in somewhat unpredictable ways. Acoustic source buoys are commanded to ping from an aircraft individually or simultaneously using different frequencies. The drifting receivers relay acoustic and auxiliary data to the aircraft for analysis of possible target detections followed by localization, classification and prosecution. In a GPS denied area of the globe, or without the use of any aircraft ability to localize the buoys, innovative acoustic approaches which leverage acoustic processing of the transmitted pings and incorporate innovative statistical methods are an excellent means of determining the relative position of each buoy and the overall shape of the buoy field. Understanding buoy positions and the overall position of the array will provide better localization of the target and the overall time to prosecute that target can be reduced."

The feasibility will be based on the realized accuracy gains; achieving real-time data turn-around; and the computer information processing (IP) resources needed for estimating AOUs in real time. Achieving these capabilities and demonstrating the overall feasibility requires a clear understanding of each aspect of the resultant multi-element processing information exchange. As identified in the SBIR topic discussion, the principal data input elements to be addressed in the algorithm development are: estimates of the initial buoy locations; estimates of the speed of sound in water; estimates of current velocities; and the acoustic signals [generated by the VLA source and received by the directional array sonobuoys in the deployed field]."

The area of uncertainty will be significantly reduced by incorporating advanced buoy localization methods and by retrospective multiple hypothesis tracking on selected receivers with lower detection thresholds. The buoy localization techniques will reduce buoy location errors, sound speed uncertainty, and compass bias errors. The multiple hypothesis tracker will reduce target azimuth errors by repeated measurements of the targets angle of arrival. We seek to reduce the circular error probability radius by a factor of two (2), resulting in a four times reduction in AOU. Accurate and reliable AOUs will be computed from the position probability density function of the target, using in-situ estimates of the relevant target localization parameters. The buoy localization algorithms and retrospective tracker will be used to assess the effects different buoy patterns have on the resulting target AOU."

When a malfunction disables one of these submersibles, under certain scenarios it can be recovered by towing, using a rigid sled for support. The current sled is large and heavy: too large to be carried aboard a small craft like a Navy RHIB, and too large to be carried aboard a larger ship as standard equipment. A lightweight, inflatable sled that could facilitate high-speed surface towing of a disabled SDV or SWCS would improve the Navys ability to effect recovery over a broader range of circumstances. We propose to use lightweight drop-stitch inflatable panels, combined with an inflatable RHIB-style collar tube, to develop such a sled that would provide the stability and hydrodynamic shape required to safely support a disabled submersible while towing at speeds up to 20 knots."

        "abstract": "To fabricate high-quality composite components with acceptable thermal properties and low void volume, autoclaves are typically essential to provide elevated temperature processing cycles and external pressure required for adequate compaction. However, autoclaves represent large capital and energy investments while limiting the size of fabricated parts and production flexibility. Out-of-autoclave (OOA) fabrication technologies have not matured enough to consistently produce low-void content, high-quality parts. Advanced OOA methods are required to effectively apply heat and compact the resulting composites to meet the stringent mechanical specifications of structural aerospace components. Because large ovens have many of the same fabrication constraints as autoclaves, heating films\/blankets have been employed for OOA applications. A potential improvement would be to use heating elements based on carbon nanotubes, such as those being developed by our partner at NC State University (NSCU). These systems will provide excellent temperature distribution across the composite while using less energy than conventional ovens\/autoclaves. Engineers at Luna Innovations recently developed a simple composite fabrication technology which has demonstrated low-porosity composite fabrication using a single vacuum bag for compaction. Luna will combine our expertise along with novel nano-heating systems at NCSU to develop efficient, OOA technology for the fabrication and repair of aerospace-quality composites."

(SDC) has developed a conceptual out of autoclave (OOA) composite curing patch system based on integrated nanomaterial heaters that can be applied in repair applications to support the Navys need for an energy efficient, autoclave-quality repair method to support the EQ-4C Triton Program and other composite aircraft. Current repair methods utilized in composite repair do not produce bonded repairs that are virgin-laminate quality or acceptable by the FAA for structural components. The two major flaws in the current method are the heat application and lack of quality assurance of the joint. SDCs Laminate Integrated Nanostructure Based Autoclave-less Cure (LINBAC) repair technology will provide the Navy with a method for producing autoclave-quality composite repairs in-situ without the need for the high costs and stringent facility requirements of an autoclave. The technology uses nanostructured heaters integrated into the laminate and laid out in a gridding pattern and integrated sensors for quality assurance purposes. SDC has estimated that a 50% reduction in aircraft downtime could be realized for critical assets through the use of the LINBAC system over a traditional repair method. SDC plans to develop the heater technology and quality assurance method, then realize the repair technology."

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and the PARADIM Center at Cornell University will develop photoconductive infrared detectors capable of achieving a detectivity of 2 x 10^11 cm*Hz^1\/2\/W and a noise-equivalent power (NEP) of less than 0.5 pW\/Hz^1\/2 at ambient temperature. These gains will be realized by creating fully encapsulated epitaxial films of ternary lead salts. Using vapor-phase deposition techniques, PSI and team members will grow strain-free epitaxial heterostructures consisting of a ternary lead salt photoconductive layer, custom-grown single-crystal substrates engineered to match the lattice constant of the absorber, and an epitaxial capping layer. This approach\/architecture will enable quantum efficiencies of greater than 30% by eliminating structural defects such as misfit dislocations and unpassivated surface states that compromise carrier extraction. During Phase I, PSI will demonstrate growth of single-crystal substrates and strain-free ternary lead salt epilayers. PSI will also submit a complete design for a photoconductive detector. In a Phase I option, PSI and partners will demonstrate growth of epitaxial passivation layers lattice-matched to the growth substrate and measure the photoresponse of test devices. During Phase II, PSI will create and test complete detectors meeting the above specifications for detectivity, NEP, and quantum efficiency."

        "abstract": "The US Navys Combined Electro-Optical\/Infrared Surveillance and Response System (CESARS) is seeking medium wavelength infrared detectors (MWIR) that can use spectral signatures in 2-5 m range to remotely detect and characterize explosive chemicals or chemical warfare species. Group III-V and II-VI compound semiconductors-based focal plane arrays (FPAs) have the desired properties in the MWIR for remote detection of chemical species, however they require cryogenic cooling to minimize dark current noise, which adds significantly to the size, weight, power and cost of the detector. On the other hand, narrow bandgap lead salts can operate at &gt;200 K, and are also more chemically stable. Binary lead salts have been well-studied for MWIR applications. However, mixed chalcogenides that offer wavelength tunability, are not commercially available mainly due to challenges in manufacturing device-grade material. We propose to develop a high-quality ternary lead salt detector which can operate at room temperature with high detectivity, and with cutoff wavelength spanning the range of 3.5 to 4.6 m. A novel cost-effective method for fabricating high-quality films will be demonstrated. Such films will then by integrated into Resonant Cavity-Enhanced FPA architecture to improve detectivity, QE and tunability of the MWIR detectors."

This SBIR will allow us to develop new detectors that are well suited for threat-warning applications and for commercial use with industrial inspection. We will incorporate and expand upon advances in PbSe detectors made under our participation in the DARPA WIRED program along with BAE Systems. In addition, ternary alloy lead salts are within the capability of the existing SJOS lead salt film growth facility, and will offer new possibilities for detector performance. Research by our team to date has already begun to incorporate these techniques, and shows promise to boost signal-to-noise by more than a factor of 10. This would be sufficient to realize the goals of this program based on our existing measurements. Here we propose research and development in ternary alloy lead salts in order to achieve a range of cutoff wavelengths from 3.5 to 4.6 m with a D* on the order of 1E11 Jones based on standard lead salt detector characterization practices."

        "abstract": "The US Navy has been moving towards Integrated Power Systems (IPS) for Naval ships because they separate the prime movers from the propulsion train, maximize the efficiency, reduce acoustic signatures, improve redundancy, improve survivability, and provide compatibility with the increasing power requirements from advanced weapons, sensors, and radar systems. In electric warship design the ability to rapidly test many architectural concepts by simulating operational activities is critical for successfully completing early stage design activities. Further, integration of IPS design with LEAPS is essential for compatibility with the Navys overall ship design process. Available power system simulation tools require fidelity of information and computational resources that are too high for early stage design activities. The proposed research will address this need and create an Emulator Toolkit for LEAPS. Emulators (i.e. surrogate models) will represent the time varying behavior of components and\/or subsystems of an IPS. A mathematical synthesis method will be integrating the emulators for creating a surrogate model for the entire IPS. During Phase I alternative mathematical methods for generating and integrating the emulators will be investigated and documented. A down selection of the most appropriate methods will be completed and an implementation plan compatible with LEAPS will be made."

        "abstract": "New CPES concepts are pushing the electrical power demands of U.S. Navy ships continually higher. What makes these technologies fundamentally different are their very high pulse loads and highly distributed, interconnected architectures. Ships cannot support these new technologies without considerable modifications. The ONR-funded Electric Ship Research and Design Consortium produced the Smart Ship Systems Design (S3D) tool to address shortcomings in existing tools, but S3D is still very limited. In its current state, S3D can only perform quasi-static analysis of thermal, mechanical, and electrical loads, which can miss key elements of simulating high pulse loads. S3D also lacks a statistical method for understanding variability in operational mission loads. Finally, system component definitions in S3D do not support set-based design (SBD) philosophies being adopted by other Navy tools, such as RSDE. In this effort, we propose to research and document methods to improve S3D with statistical mission emulators, fully-dynamic time-domain analysis, and surrogate modeling techniques to support early-stage ship design and SBD. Perhaps most importantly, we propose to deliver adaptable modeling strategies so that S3D can evolve and continue to offer valuable analysis as the CPES landscape is still rapidly changing."

Noise induced hearing loss has become the most costly Department of Defense disability, and in FY15, 2.5M veterans received $1B in compensation benefits for tinnitus and hearing loss. Creare will develop an improved blast nozzle design that offers improved coating removal productivity and energy efficiency while reducing noise emissions by up to 30 dB relative to existing nozzles.

        "abstract": "An abrasive blasting nozzle is a complex aero-acoustic noise source, characterized by super-sonic, two-phase flow. Noise from an abrasive blasting nozzle is comprised of three sources: (i) turbulent mixing noise (ii) shock-associated noise and (iii) jet impingement noise. It is not uncommon for abrasive nozzles to generate noise levels greater than 120 dB(A); far exceeding typical occupational noise limits. The work proposed herein will apply sophisticated aero-acoustics principals to the design of an abrasive blasting nozzle; reducing noise from the nozzle while simultaneously improving the devices productivity. The nozzle developed through this effort will provide industry with a device that represents an evolutionary step forward in safety and efficiency."

Verus Research (VR) team members have designed, built and tested similar capabilities for HPRF systems and have extensive expertise and experience in the field of effects testing and will leverage that expertise to develop a cost effective, compact solution. The concept of switching RF output to generate various pulses with a few nanosecond rise times and pulse durations ranging from 10s to 1000 nanoseconds has broad potential to the HPRF testing community. VR proposes designing and modeling a plasma switch assembly to determine the optimum physical and electrical characteristics required to create an efficient and reliable switch for multi-megawatt sources. The pulse shaping assembly consists of a pair of switches (front and tail clipping), a high-power circulator and a dual output pulser to drive. Verus Research will model and design the system with the broadest versatility and integrate its operational parameters into the design and the appropriate models."

        "abstract": "Advancements in body armor combined with better combat casualty care have greatly increased the survival rate of soldiers suffering battlefield trauma injuries. The increased survivability, however, has resulted in an increase of wounded warriors being sent home with severe injuries that ultimately reduce their quality of life post-treatment, especially amputations and damage to vascularized composite tissues. Recent research and advances in regenerative medicine offers never-before seen possibilities for new therapies and treatment of trauma injuries to vascularized composite tissues; however, many surgical and treatment outcomes are still affected by the limited amount of time avaible for organ or tissue preservation following a trauma induced injury. Surgical outcomes could be greatly improved if tissue salvage and conservation could be achieved over longer time periods. Towards these ends, TDA Research, Inc. proposes to develop a novel perfusion system for the salvage and repair of trauma injured vascularized composite tissue. This system will increase the preservation time for vascularized composite tissue, enabling advanced treatments or transplant capabilities."

        "abstract": "EpiBone is a company engineering living, anatomically precise and functionally mature skeletal grafts from autologous stem cells. Cartilage injuries affect approximately 900K Americans with &gt;400K procedures performed every year. Cartilage lesions are frequently associated with other articular injuries and can progress to joint degeneration and osteoarthritis (OA). OA affects20% Americans with costs surpassing $130B per year. Compared to civilian population, active military service members are affected with OA diseases with higher rates and younger ages. OA is among the most common causes of disability in service members who are medically retired or separated from the military. 71% of extremityinjuries suffered by soldiers in recent conflicts have been associated with intra-articular injury.  Current therapeutic practices suffer from several drawbacks, thus creating the need for novel, cell-based therapies for regenerating functional cartilage tissue.  We here propose to develop a unique class of bioreactor-cultured, stratified, mechanically functional osteochondral grafts for articular cartilage repair that are customized to the patient and defect being treated. The success of our product could have a tremendous impact in ameliorating current standards of treatment for osteochondral defects, representing a definitive solution avoiding morbidity, and leading to faster recovery and return to duty for the injured soldiers."

        "abstract": "While millions of patients are affected by the inability to bank many types of cells, tissues and vital organs, the demands on optimal preservation modalities for  mass casualty contexts are  higher and not well met.  In this context, solutions need to be transport-friendly and field ready. Our innovations allow indefinite storage of living biological matter at high subzero temperatures that enable transportation and storage without the need for cumbersome use of liquid nitrogen. The approach is universal and will enable stockpiling of (i) bone marrow (and cord blood\/peripheral blood-HSCs), natural and bioengineered (ii) skin, (iii) veins and arteries, and eventually also (iv) VCA and (v) vital organs.     Importantly our approach does not suffer the CPA toxicity, osmotic injury or ice damage inherent in all current preservation modalities. We propose a novel approach to biopreservation that combines recent advances in nature inspired, non-toxic cryoprotective and stress tolerance enhancement strategies with a novel isochoric  (constant volume) thermodynamically-advantaged storage system that enables indefinite storage at high subzero temperatures.  The commercial potential for this approach, embodying both novel techniques of biobanking and enabling devices, targets a large addressable market currently of the order of $50 billion for cell, tissue and organ units worldwide."

These devices have largely excluded pulse oximetry because non-traditional sites, such as the chest, arm and legs, pose a challenge.  We have previously demonstrated the ability to accurately monitor pulse oximetry on the chest, arms and calf.  This project proposes to develop a wearable, secure wireless adhesive patch system to monitor pulse oximetry, respiration rate and other core vital signs from non-traditional sites.  The system will provide real-time, continuous monitoring, and be able to withstand the physical environmental challenges of shock, dust, sand, and water. The battery-powered, wireless oximeter will transmit computed parameters and pulse oximeter photoplethysmograph (PPG) waveform to military-selected medic end user device (EUD).  Data transmission to the EUD enables two features: simultaneous monitoring of multiple casualties; and development of predictive models and indices independent of the monitoring device. The wireless oximeter will include technological advancements such as miniaturization, reduced power consumption, high bandwidth wireless communication and enhanced measurement algorithms. These advances will lay the foundation for further development and testing in this rugged environment and integration beyond the medics EUD into larger medical record systems."

New MEMS inertial sensors will enable the Army&apos;s next generation of smaller and lighter missiles. Tanenhaus and Associates, Inc. miniature IMU (M350) meets SWPaC requirements using its patented innovative approach of combining arrays of COTS MEMS sensors to achieve far superior performance than MEMS used alone. The MEMS arrays provide redundancy and robustness and achieve sensor low drift errors. In this Phase I SBIR will expand the use of COTS MEMS technology that has exceptionally wide angular rate range for use low cost missile stabilization systems.  A reduced size version of the M350 is proposed that will meet the 1.5 cu.in low power low weight goals of this program. When TAIs low drift error solution is applied to MEMS gyro capable of 100,000 deg.\/sec angular rates, the jitter performance is dramatically lower. The TAI IMU\/INS technology is flexible; software upgrades allow for its adaptability for a variety of uses with the same internal hardware. Both the inner electronic module and the outside case can be changed easily to meet small missile requirements."

As a repurposed SDR, this hardware radio supports firmware reprogramming to multiple waveform configurations (DoD specified), and accepts IF block down-conversions from L, S, C, X, and Ku bands. Size and power usage are only a small fraction of the legacy systems currently deployed (according to non-classified data comparisons); however, full legacy compatibility and interoperability are inherent and guaranteed by design. Further, support for future missile waveforms is supported due to the generous digital signal processing logic resources made available by the Xilinx Kintex-7 series FPGA used in the Space Micro tri-band SDR. Figure 1 illustrates the functional blocks of our dual-channel SDR."

As one of its program pillars it intends to reduce the MC footprint and replace obsolete architecture.  As an integral part of the IAMD architecture the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2 - Intercept mission will provide a robust platoon-level protection capability against all projected rocket, artillery and mortar (RAM), cruise missile, and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) threats, and subsequently is interested in expanding its complement of Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) interceptors, including, but not limited to, the AIM-9X, the AIM-120, the AI3 and the Miniature Hit-To-Kill (MHTK).    This proposal addresses the potential problem of unique\/stovepipe missile uplink\/downlink (UL\/DL) equipment, which from a size, weight and power (SWaP) perspective impacts the mobility and transportability of the MML.  The opportunity is to leverage Innoflights expertise developing and fielding compact, rugged software defined radios to design a flexible multi-channel, multi-user radio supporting missile UL\/DL implementations for multiple missiles.  The target SWaP will match the IAMDs Small Footprint Radio (SFR) supporting the IFPC platoon network communications requirements."

The Ka \/ X SCR will support 300 Mbps downlink and 5 Mbps uplinks rates using spectrally efficient waveforms.  It will offer interoperability with standard government and commercial ground stations such as the Army RGT (Remote Ground Terminal), AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network), NASA Near Earth Network (NEN), and multiple commercial service networks.      It will support advanced waveform processing include various spectrally efficient modulation techniques, forward error correction methods and simple bus interfaces.  Link confidentiality and authentication will be supported by internal AES-256 encryption suite or and external certified unit such as the Innoflight Gnome or the KI-55.  A built-in Solid State Data Recorder (SSDR) will host up to 1 Tbyte of mission data and support the full downlink throughput of 300 Mbps.      Innoflight will leverage its on-orbit heritage and market leading SCR technology as the point of departure in order to reduce the overall design risk and focus on the high risk elements of this effort."

        "abstract": "Small satellites have never lacked the capability to collect large quantities of operationally relevant data. The real limitation in fielding large constellations has been the inability to downlink the large quantities of data. Neither the ground station assets nor the high throughput communications subsystems have existed to close many point-to-point tight-beam links to low-Earth orbit. To satisfy the demand for these increased data volumes, TUI proposes to both leverage and extend its existing modular SWIFT software-defined radio (SDR) platform to create a multi-band S-, X-, and Ka-band transceiver capable of closing SATCOM links in excess of 300 Mbps to smaller, tactically placed ground stations. Key enabling technologies include the integration TUIs existing three degree-of-freedom (3DOF) COBRA gimbal for steering high-gain apertures, existing and in-development X- and Ka-band RF frontends with greater than 500 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth, and the proposed next generation SWIFT baseband processor with greater than 500 MHz of modulation bandwidth and the ability to stream significant quantities of data to and from external high-density storage subsystems. The proposed transceiver will guarantee the operational relevance of the next generation of tactical US Army small satellites."

        "abstract": "The development of laser weapons has a profound impact on military missions throughout the services. An ideal laser system must be capable of delivering hundreds of kilowatts of average power to a target at multi-kilometer ranges through adverse atmospheric conditions. The highest power within diffraction limited divergence was demonstrated with solid state and fiber lasers. However, development of multi-gain media systems where gain media (crystal or fiber) pumped by laser diodes reduces the overall efficiency of the laser system and therefore increases the total power requirements. On the other hand, high power laser diode (LD) arrays that demonstrate highest efficiency and compactness suffer from high divergence resulted from inevitable multimode regime.   The new approach we propose levels of LD control and integration. It includes a new design of a semiconductor waveguide and an external cavity geometry with volume Bragg gratings (VBGs) providing spectral narrowing and angular divergence down to diffraction limit for high pumping currents; coherent combining by means of multiplexed VBGs that enable efficient radiation exchange between individual LDs and phase locking to provide a coherent LD array; spectral combining of coherent LD arrays by a sequence of multiplexed VBGs."

        "abstract": "From 1985 to 1998, nearly $175M was invested in developing coherent semiconductor laser arrays in the Air Force PILOT program. However, the laser systems that were ultimately deployed from this program were either single-element lasers or incoherent laser arrays  no viable coherent arrays were produced.  The key remaining challenges to producing coherent semiconductor laser arrays are:  (A) Both individual emitters and coherently combined arrays fall pray to spatial and dynamic instabilities due to inherent nonlinearities in the semiconductor medium.  (B) The large number of laser elements required to reach Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) power levels dictate that active phase control of the diodes is required, impairing the overall system with a large and cumbersome overhead.  We propose a qualitatively new approach to semiconductor laser beam combination that overcomes these obstacles.  Specifically, we propose to develop a coherent semiconductor laser system that provides:  (1) Mitigation of spatial and dynamic nonlinear instabilities  (2) Strict diffraction-limited single-lobe emission  (3) Inherent scalability with no complex controls, active feedback, or phase stabilization  The new methodology is scalable both in parallel and concatenated serial application, and enables for the first time the use of broad-area semiconductor lasers with diffraction-limited beam quality."

        "abstract": "Operational availability, reliability, and performance of Army aircraft are key factors in achieving mission success. The aircraft depend on health of their systems to perform reliably over extended periods of time. Monitoring of aircraft usage trends and time spent in stressful flight regimes produces the information needed to apply prognostic health management (PHM) knowledge to operational\/maintenance decision-making at individual aircraft and fleet levels. Achieving the information architecture for maintainers and flight crews to apply new PHM technologies effectively requires an advanced, intelligent network. AVNIK Defense Solutions, Inc. proposes, with our subcontract team member Instrumental Sciences, Inc. (ISI), a flexible integrated intelligent network (FIIN) concept based on the new technologies of distributed work environments and cooperative intelligent agent architectures. This AVNIK concept will lead to a robust network to meet Future Vertical Lift (FVL) systems needs for automated handling and sharing of distributed information from aircraft operation and maintenance histories. The primary objectives of the Phase I research are to (1) determine the feasibility of the AVNIK FIIN concept and (2) characterize the potential of the FIIN implementation to improve aircraft\/system availability."

        "abstract": "To address the need for a flexible integrated intelligent network (FIIN) for prognostics health management (PHM) for Army aviation applications, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Intelligent Flexible Open Architecture Network (IFOAN). It is based on an open architecture network and Joint Common Architecture (JCA)-compliant software. Specifically, the innovation in design of a hierarchical fiber optic network and design of PHM software incorporating grid-based data mining, advanced statistical classification, and a high-performance net-centric rule engine will enable the IFOAN to provide PHM capabilities to aircraft maintainers and crew members over a FIIN. As a result, IFOAN offers such advantages as a flexible, integrated, robust, reliable, resilient, low size\/weight\/power, broad bandwidth, reconfigurable and self-healable device, compatible with both legacy and future aircraft. It provides accurate and automated damage inspection and near-real-time trend analyses and prediction of remaining useful life of aircraft. In Phase I, POC will conduct a feasibility and trade-off assessment of FIIN options and design the IFOAN architecture, addressing Army requirements and technical challenges. In Phase II, POC will develop a working prototype and assess its performance in a Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL) environment. The Phase II IFOAN will reach technology readiness level (TRL)-5."

        "abstract": "Significant strides towards sensors and prognostic algorithms needed for an integrated rotorcraft Prognostic Health Management (PHM) system have been made in recent years. Future rotorcraft such as those in the Future Vertical Lift family can benefit from a Flexible Integrated Intelligent Network (FIIN). Sporian proposes to develop a FIIN for rotorcraft PHM that will be highly autonomous, self-organizing, and self-aware. The network will be designed to be highly fault- and damage-tolerant. The FIIN will self-re-organize and continue to perform in the case of failure or damage to elements of the system. The overall concept for the proposed system is based on multiple FIIN coordinators operating in a masterless peer configuration that interface with existing non-PHM sensors as well as a suite of PHM-specific sensors or sensor systems. The FIIN will perform prognostics on sensor data and when actionable maintenance information is generated, will deliver that data to maintenance personnel on the ground. Phase I efforts will focus on defining the overall system requirements, evaluating competing FIIN options, and developing an initial design for the on-aircraft and ground portions of the FIIN system. Phase I Option will involve prototyping and demonstration of critical aspects of the network in a laboratory environment."

By following the MOSA design principles, the FIIN architecture will leverage investments made throughout the defense industrial base to produce new commercial products, practices, and technologies that will integrate advanced capabilities more easily into future Army aircraft and field superior PHM capabilities more quickly and affordably into legacy Army rotorcraft. We will look to adopt into the FIIN architecture open standards-based technologies from the automotive industry (e.g., Controlled Area Network) or IP based technologies to provide a common interface for a message-based communication protocol and integration of multiple PHM control modules from health-enabled aircraft systems. Leveraging the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) work being done by the Open Group FACE Consortium, we will consider the possibilities of integrating a communication protocol that introduces a standard interface for run-time PHM data exchange with FACE compliant and systems. This includes researching the Joint Common Architecture (JCA) to ensure that the two developing frameworks are considered in defining the FIIN architecture. We will also consider integration of actual diagnostic logic and corrosion sensors into the PHM modules."

        "abstract": "Missile seekers for precision guided munitions are key elements of modern defense systems. Seekers using laser guidance or imaging require IR- transparent protective domes. Depending on the application, these domes may plastic, glass, ceramic, polycrystal, or single crystal. Plastic and glass are relatively inexpensive and easily formed into non-spherical shapes. They are, however relatively soft and fragile. Ceramic and crystalline domes are much more rugged and suitable for higher temperatures, but using present technology are expensive and generally only spherical sections because of the difficulty and high cost of producing non-spherical, aerodynamic shapes. This effort will investigate new technology that combines the low cost and formability of strengthened glass with the ruggedness of ceramics. Chemically strengthened ceramic-glass composites can be produced at much lower cost and require little or no post processing. The costs of manufacturing and processing are comparable to that of glass, but the strength is improved through inclusion of ceramic particulates and ion-exchange in the glass phase. In this proposed effort, Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc., in collaboration with researchers at Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) will investigate the fabrication of glass ceramic domes in aerodynamic shapes using low cost processes using technologies developed by the DOD at NRL."

        "abstract": "The KAI team proposes to develop a comprehensive experimental and numerical research program to characterize the ablation, thermal, and mechanical response of new solid rocket motor (SRM) internal insulation material to facilitate ARMY&apos;s new advanced missiles. The principal aim of the project is to introduce an innovative elastomeric ablative material with superior ablation resistance and lower density than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)\/Aramid currently used as internal insulation for SRMs. The objective is to develop and demonstrate an innovative and mature solution for SRM internal insulation. The proposed SRM internal insulation material system is based on a combination of a low density elastomeric polymer, density reducer fillers, advanced organic fibers, adhesion and char promoter fillers. The combination of these components enables the design of an elastomeric insulating material with improved char retention, ablation resistance, insulation capability, superior adhesion performance with modern SRM propellants based on hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) binders, and at the same time, lower density compared to the SOTA formulations such as EPDM\/Aramid. Success of the project will lead to a scalable thermal insulation material to improve the operating lifespan of structures that undergo extreme environments for ARMY missile systems."

        "abstract": "Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. proposes new elastomeric materials for use in solid rocket motor case insulation that are low cost, easy to produce, and can integrate with existing manufacturing. CRG already has a cyanate ester elastomer (CEE) material that has been tested in a sub-scale motor and performed well, particularly in low mass flux conditions, but if properly reinforced it offers improvement across a broad performance range. Now, a new elastomeric material is in development that is based on CRGs family of high temperature organic resins, MG Resins, and it is anticipated to perform even better than the CEE materials tested previously. In this program, CRG will evaluate the suitability of MG Elastomer for rocket motor insulation. CRG will then compare its MG Elastomers with its CEE. The material that shows the best promise to displace the current EPDM material will then be carried into Phase II for processing scale up, supply chain maturation, cost optimization and sub-scale motor testing. The full, three-phase program offers multiple routes to achieving disruptive innovation in solid rocket motor insulation technology, replacing the EPDM incumbent while maintaining cost, availability, and manufacturing advantages that have made that material a dependable solution for thirty years."

        "abstract": "Orbital Research Inc. (Cleveland, OH) will develop a Multisensing Target Discriminator (MTD) for integration with existing and future shoulder launched munitions, with the initial target being 83mm platforms. The Orbital Team, including Nammo Talley (Mesa AZ), will leverage their expertise in shock hardened electronics and analog sensor conditioning and amplification. Having Nammo Talley on the team with their position as the integrator of the relevant target platforms will enable solutions to be designed in a focused fashion, specifically as to what can be fielded fastest. Key to Orbitals approach is to focus on starting to discriminate the target before impact, in order to allocate more time for a more comprehensive decision tree for discrimination. The MTD is a ruggedized sensor module that can be integrated into the nose of the 83mm round that will provide this discriminatory information to the fuze in order to best inform a multi-mode warhead. It contains three main sensor components that enable the Multisensing Target Discriminator to perform its analysis rapidly and with better results than a single sensor can. Test capabilities on-site at Orbital Research will ensure rapid and low cost experimentation to validate design concepts, including Orbitals 100,000 g Shock table."

        "abstract": "The development of precision shoulder launched munitions and other lightweight, soldier borne weapons systems requires a new class of sensors and sensor systems that can autonomously detect and discriminate between various target classes in real time. This is especially true for fire and forget munitions where the weapon has an on-board seeker system that can autonomously hone in on a desired target. Recent research shows that a wide variety of sensor systems including stand-off sensors for collision avoidance, advanced infrared and low light detectors, RF detectors, magnetometers, direct impact sensors as well as others can be used to detect various targets in and around unmanned air and ground vehicles as well as missile systems. The goal of this research is to develop and integrate several of these sensors to form a unique miniaturized sensor system that can be used not only to detect various targets but also discriminate between target classes. Specifically, the system of sensor systems will be developed to integrate with soldier borne weapons systems and will be designed to perform the detection and discrimination functions autonomously within 100 microseconds and with better than 95% accuracy."

        "abstract": "Optical switches that are simultaneously fast (sub-nanosecond), low loss (&lt; 2 dB), and add low noise (&lt; 10-4 added noise photons per mode) are not available commercially, but would be an important tool for manipulating quantum signals. It is important for such a switch to operate near 1550 nm, as this is the lowest loss wavelength in standard optical fibers and as such is desirable for distributing quantum information over long distances. Switches based on cross-phase modulation in optical fiber are capable of meeting the requirements, but have thus far for technological reasons operated near 1310 nm. We will develop new optical switches suitable for quantum signals in the 1550 nm band. Various components of the switch will be characterized to optimize the design, and the switching function will be demonstrated. Since the proposed switch geometry is essentially a long interferometer, an active phase locking scheme will be developed to enable stable and reliable operation. The locking scheme will be extended to allow for multiple cascaded interferometers which enables more complex optical processing. We will demonstrate the ability of the switch to maintain signal fidelity when operating on a quantum entangled signal, thereby showing the feasibility of the technology."

The design will cover 2 through 18 GHz signals, and will be specifically adapted to be form and fit compatible with the ALE-47 launcher already on the helicopters. This countermeasure will provide a minimum of 30 seconds of operation, giving the helicopter time to maneuver or otherwise address the threat. This approach is based on SI2s proven expertise in wideband antenna design, design of electronics for compact volumes, and design of power supplies for munitions and related constrained areas. In Phase I, SI2 will simulate and optimize the antenna, electronics, power supply, and aerobraking concepts for performance, size, and cost. We will fabricate and test proof-of-concept hardware demonstrators to demonstrate TRL4 at the conclusion of the Phase I program. We will also generate design packages suitable to proceed with prototype manufacturing in Phase II. In Phase II, we will build and test an expendable prototype to demonstrate TRL6 at the conclusion of the program. We will also perform additional analyses on the aerodynamics of the expendable and on options for long-shelf-life power supply solutions to assist in preparing the countermeasure to transition to a Program of Record."

        "abstract": "Passive expendable threat countermeasures have been the primary mechanism for defeating radar-guided threats to rotary wing aircraft. These dispenser systems interface directly with the Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) to select the best response to a detected threat. The modern generation of RF threats has become smarter and added agile emissions in order to see through passive countermeasures. DRFMs are active countermeasure systems that use memory to delay or store threat pulses and then digitally re-modulate the signals to produce realistic coherent false targets. SPEC is proposing a fast moving program to develop and field the worlds most advanced expendable active RF countermeasures for the protection of Rotary Wing Aircraft and ultimately for the protection of all airframes. A DRFM typically consists of RF up\/down-converter sections, ADC and DAC sections, and a high speed digital signal processor with memory. Recent advances in materials and technology offer unprecedented levels of heterogeneous on-chip integration of RF, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing circuits. SPEC proposes to develop an expendable active countermeasure system design for modern threats, using integrated, substrate level, heterogeneous technologies and packaging necessary to satisfy SWaP requirements, and extremely demanding aerodynamic performance specifications that account for rotor wash of the aircraft."

An active countermeasure consists of an RF transmitter that may be deployed in the same manner as passive countermeasures using similar equipment. In order to be considered a drop-in replacement, size and weight constraints are placed on these active countermeasures and introduce challenges in development of such devices. The proposed effort will develop a small form factor RF transmitter integrated with a rotor with autorotation capabilities. The vehicle is designed to reach stable descent after deployment without any extra power and minimal number of moving parts. Tests will be conducted to verify stable descent of the vehicle from arbitrary drop orientations and RF transmitter performance at 2-18 GHz."

Many tools require source code access, which may not be available. Existing tools also focus on specific software modules (akin to unit testing) or attack methods (e.g., fuzz testing) and do not provide the context needed to evaluate alerts. The result is that many alerts are false alarms or go unheeded, while critical problems are not appropriately emphasized. To address this need, ATC-NY will design and build SEASHORE, a software assurance tool for heterogeneous runtime environments. SEASHORE uses function call and API hooking to detect misuse or unexpected call sequences, via rules and machine learning techniques, then unifies the results of this analysis with external probes, configuration tests, and third-party tools in a hierarchical risk model. In doing so, SEASHORE helps the security analyst discover vulnerabilities and potentially malicious code in GPU-accelerated COTS software, then determine the risks those vulnerabilities pose to mission success."

The use of this specialized hardware opens up new cyber-attack vectors and creates opportunities for hiding malware from existing tools for malware analysis and detection. We propose to design and build an automated analysis tool that detects both unintentional vulnerabilities and explicitly introduced malicious code in software written for such heterogeneous hardware systems. The tool will combine both static and dynamic analysis components, which will work together to enable effective security analysis of heterogeneous software. The tool will operate at the machine-code level and will leverage and improve the extensive existing GrammaTech infrastructure for machine-code analysis."

The main thrust will focus on power scaling using a simple passive coherent beam combination technique. Scaling the output power of a single laser diode element beyond a few Watts presents a daunting challenge as phenomena such as catastrophic optical damage or heat dissipation typically limit the maximum power that a laser diode can generate. Use of passive coherent beam combination allows circumventing such limitations and scale the output power by simply adding more single elements, while maintaining a diffraction-limited beam quality and the simplicity of laser diodes."

C2Si innovation is in use of polymer composite with the conductive core made from a mixture of elastomer\/ionomer matrix and conductive self-aligning nanoparticle additives. The wire architecture is placement of healing\/rerouting layer between center conductor and outer insulator and protection polymer sheath with minimal modification of manufacturing process and possibility of reducing wire weight. C2Si team will perform Multiphysics modeling and design in Phase I. The preliminary design experimentation and reliability testing will be performed. C2Si team will demonstrate proposed design and produce testing results at proof-of- concept level. The proposed self-rerouting and curative interconnect technology (SERCUIT) is based on the prior research and development experience of C2Si PI and OSU PI who have worked together before on self-healing technologies for wire insulation. Successful completion of Phase I work will result in establishing feasibility of the proposed SERCUIT concepts and down selection of the technology meeting topic criteria."

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the need to develop a robust model for biological, geophysical, and anthropogenic ambient sounds in different environments. The spatial and temporal resolution of the sound level mapping tool will improve mission planning for both rural and urban environments. During Phase-I, a geospatial data-based ambient sound model will be developed and exercised for at least three benchmark CONUS locations, one of which contains significant anthropogenic noise. As part of this effort, geospatial database requirements will be established and new geospatial\/acoustic datasets incorporated into existing databases. The soundscape modeling framework will incorporate multiple unsupervised machine-learning approaches, with the novel goal of treating geospatial modeling inputs and different acoustic outputs as part of the same optimization problem. To downselect to Phase-II modeling approaches, the modeling tradespace will be studied for multi-metric predictive capability, efficiency, and robustness. The Phase-I effort will also develop strategies to eventually extend the ambient soundscape modeling to OCONUS locations, including identifying which geospatial data are available and exploring means for acquiring additional geospatial\/acoustic data. Eventual transition of the modeling tool to the military and commercial sectors (e.g. the real estate industry) will be aided by Phase-I technology transition planning and business case analyses."

Given either latitude\/longitude coordinates or an address, the GSM will provide the daytime ambient noise spectrum in one-third octave bands, the DNL, and the A-weighted Leq for all 24 hours. Prediction accuracy of these metrics will be measured by rigorous cross validation. Ambient Logic will increase the efficiency of GSM formulation and mitigate the effects of wind noise in the current geospatial database to achieve greater speed and accuracy. They will also investigate the impact of data on model predictions, showing how many new measurements are necessary to reach the desired accuracy in a region. In anticipation of expanding to OCONUS regions, properties of globally available data sources will be assessed and a method will be developed to target locations for acoustic measurements that will provide the most benefit. In Phase II, the GSM will provide expanded noise estimates for both CONUS and OCONUS locations. Similar to how current weather models rapidly update as measured conditions change, the Phase II GSM will accept fresh data to improve estimates at locations with limited data."

Our model follows an ICME framework for multi-scale AM simulation module consisting of a coarse-grain module for component level processing and a high fidelity module capturing material local behavior.Based on our experience, two surrogate models are selected for the proposed work and will be used to meet the requirements of computational efficiency; the main advantage of these techniques is their proven computational efficiency when properly trained. We also propose a novel topology optimization approach for the support structure which will help minimizing the overhang distortions; the simplicity of its computation guarantees a fast and robust solution. The target is to achieve high computational efficiency to meet the desired objective of calculating distortions of a small bracket (4x2.5x2 in3) within 5 minutes."

Thus, a need has arisen to perform a thorough investigation and design for innovative approaches that include methods like ray tracing which can scale as a rendering solution.Signature Research, Inc. details a solution which relies on the development of a benchmarking data set and benchmarking framework. This new capability allows one to quantitatively evaluate rendering system designs, gauge implementation decisions, and navigate advances in hardware and software technology. Our resulting proof-of-concept real-time rendering system design is based upon the foundation of the collection of empirical data across three aspects of the problem.1. Evaluation of a representative sample set of rendering frameworks covering open- and closed-source software, raster- and ray trace-based rendering methods, and various hardware and software optimization approaches.2. Benchmarking hardware changes such as networking architectures, processor designs, and cache layouts.3. Benchmarking software configuration changes at the operating system and rendering algorithm levels.These empirical results will then feed into our rendering system design to produce a rendering solution that can meet the performance and fidelity requirements for existing and future use cases."

For each propagation mechanism: specular reflection, diffraction, and diffuse scattering, we properly model the polarization behaviors and study their impacts on the multipath effects. Ray tracing is implemented as a deterministic method to model the ray interaction with the urban environments. In order to reduce the computational load of tray tracing process, a sighted object search algorithm, ray path discovery method and sectorized ray path validity check approach are developed to achieve time efficiency. Furthermore, we explore machine learning techniques to exploit the measured data for the purpose of accelerating physic based propagation model while maintaining high accuracy. Spatial and temporal statistics generated from the developed model are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy and runtime is estimated for assessing the potential of the proposed model. The software is designed with cross-platform functionality so that it can operate on different host platforms, and make it easier to be compatible with existing Army simulation and scene generation software and tool suites in the future."

        "abstract": "MATSYS proposes to develop and demonstrate novel tungsten-based alloys with nanocrystalline microstructure and a scalable manufacturing process for cost-effective fabrication of kinetic energy (KE) penetrators.  Depleted Uranium (DU) alloys demonstrate superior ballistic performance over conventional tungsten heavy alloys (WHA).  However, residue from DU munitions presents issues, such as the cleanup of a persistent health and environmental hazard.  The increased performance of DU is attributed to a localized flow-softening behavior, more commonly referred to as adiabatic shear.  WHA alloys are a natural candidate for KE penetrator applications because of their high density.  However, they do not generally show any strain localization desires for self-sharpening behavior.  Recent work has shown that tungsten-based alloys with nanocrystalline microstructure exhibit strain localization and extraordinary promise as a penetrator material.  Our approach is to use thermodynamic modeling to design new stable nanocrystalline tungsten-based alloys, and then use high energy milling to refine the microstructure of the powder for the selected compositions and consolidate these powders into bulk, fully dense, nanostructured material.  This effort will use thermodynamic modeling to identify potential alloy compositions, and combine our unique expertise in high energy milling and instrumented-Hot Isostatic Pressing to develop bulk nanostructured tungsten-based alloys for next generation KE munitions."

In Phase I, QuesTek will utilize our proprietary thermodynamic modeling capabilities to design a novel Hf alloy with a transformation temperature optimized to harness the thermally-assisted constitutive instabilities that arise during adiabatic heating and promote shear banding. Design validation will be performed via thermal analysis of laboratory-scale buttons. A scaled up prototype will undergo quasi-static and high strain rate testing along with microstructural characterization to validate shear band formation. These tests will serve to demonstrate the feasibility of effective self-sharpening behavior of the Hf-alloy phase to be ultimately combined with a high-density ductile W phase in a sintered composite. Finite Element Modeling will be employed in the Phase I Option to predict shear banding behavior in composite systems. The final design will optimize the tradeoff between self-sharpening behavior and high density while maintaining the desired properties of high strength, ductility, and fracture toughness to ensure penetrator integrity during launch and impact."

In a small region, very high localization accuracy can be obtained. IFTs rich experience in cooperative and non-cooperative target localization greatly reduce the rick in the project implementation. The system can be applied in indoor and outdoor environment as long as three or more platforms have their location determined. Its deployment is convenient.

        "abstract": "Micro-infrared (IR) camera packages are now possible as a result of uncooled sensor performance improvements (sensitivity and time constant) in small pixel pitch (12 m). Leveraging prior investment in miniaturized uncooled infrared camera cores, digital readout circuitry and electronics design, there is an opportunity to demonstrate a digital output micro-IR camera package with direct application to nano-unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and other very compact soldier-borne situational-awareness sensor applications. Black Forest Engineering has developed micro uncooled cameras on prior SBIR efforts using 17 m pixel pitch uncooled FPA and custom ASIC camera electronics for micro-UAV applications. The proposed Phase I effort will show proof of concept of micro-IR cameras for nano-UAVs. The design will support camera core weight &lt; 2 grams, and a packaged camera weight of 5 to 18 grams depending on optics selection. The camera will support rapid turn-on and rapid in-flight non-uniformity correction. DoD performance models will confirm the design meets the Armys system performance requirements, target detection and activity recognition as specified for the MCoE Soldier Borne Sensor. A validated sensor package design will detail sensor components and performance modeling (including size, weight and power) to asses risk and maturity of the prototype design."

        "abstract": "Current radar systems are driven by sensing requirements in the field. Today, and even more so in the future, the operation of these systems will be plagued by heterogeneous threats, each seeking to counter the sensing capability with different types of countermeasures. The traditional approach to solving this problem would be to introduce multiple individual systems (sensors and effectors) into the solution space. We view this as an inefficient and ineffective approach to solving asymmetric threats. As a game changing approach to the future battlespace, we envision a more flexible system configuration which increases the modality of future radar architectures through an RF Node architecture. Spear Research defines radar waveform diversity as the ability to transmit and receive specialized waveforms that enhance existing radar capabilities and execute alternate missions beyond standard radar functions."

(Hyperion) in an effort to address the needs laid out in the solicitation A16-112 titled Next Generation Intelligent Power Distribution Unit (IPDU) for Tactical Microgrids plans to develop an intelligent power distribution system that will make tactical microgrids more robust, while reducing fuel consumption. The key advantage of the Hyperion proposed approach to an IPDU is the ability to shed loads based on mission priorities to match the available output of the microgrid to prevent total power failure. To accomplish this, the lowest priority loads will be temporarily switched off so the prime power source is not overloaded or prevent the circuit breakers from tripping. The current approach that power managers and tactical microgrid design engineers must use is to size generators for worse case loading, which typically results in generator capacity several times larger than the average power levels. The ability to shed loads based on priority will facilitate the use of smaller generators which in turn can operate closer to ratings resulting in increased efficiency (smaller generators equal less fuel) with less maintenance (due to less wet stacking)."

SDCs superhydrophobic abrasion-resistant coating (SHARC) can be applied retroactively to existing equipment or integrated within the production line of air drop components. SDC will utilize a homogeneously layered compacted powder suspended in a superhydrophobic polymer binder to create an abrasion resistant coating that provides the necessary durability for airdrop applications. Abrasion and disruption of the surface geometry will simply reveal another layer below with identical superhydrophobic properties to the previous surface. The coating will also have a high emissivity to aid in evaporation of any remnant moisture on the surfaces of all airdrop hardware, and act as a solid lubricant for contact features in mechanical hardware, such as the parachute release.  This SHARC coating will give extensive protection over extended periods of time, drastically reducing maintenance and being applied at a low cost."

Resodyn Corporation proposes for development a durable, moisture-impermeable, super-hydrophobic thermoplastic coating (SHTC) material to address the U.S. Armys need under consideration. The SHTC will be in essence a low-melting temperature powder coating material capable to strongly adhere to steel, aluminum and textile (nylon) surfaces without causing any degradation to any of the abovementioned substrates. For metallic substrates the material may be deposited either through traditional electrostatic deposition methods or through the novel polymer thermal spray (PTS) deposition method invented by Resodyn Corporation. The proposed SHTC material will be suitable for both retrofitting existent airdrop hardware at the U.S. Army depot-level and coating brand new hardware at the OEM level. Initial pre-proposal results from an un-optimized SHTC material indicate that the proposed material technology has great potential for waterproofing of U.S. Armys airdrop related hardware and equipment. The PTS technology will allow for field repair of SHTC-coated articles."

Despite its performance under normal conditions, the Army requires new materials with improved durability for extreme environmental conditions.  The currently used material has seen significant damage in fielded systems due to i) high speed wind whip to fabric, ii) cold cracking at temperatures below -30F, and iii) high stiffness at low temperatures.  Luna proposes to develop a highly durable toughened polymer fabric coating system that will overcome the durability issues associated with traditional PVC laminates in extreme environmental conditions.  Luna will utilize our extensive experience with polymer modification and fabric construction to develop novel multifunctional textile that will achieve these stringent structural properties.  These goals will be achieved to reduce the overall ownership cost of shelter systems by improving functional durability and reducing packing weight and volume."

        "abstract": "The army is seeking a new and novel generation of precision munitions that do not rely solely on GPS for targeting and guidance. The weapons systems proposed herein will utilize GPS, however, they will also be capable of operating in GPS denied environments. These munitions will function using both visual feedback derived from real time telemetry, manual selection of target using touch screen technology, and novel algorithms designed to use the real time telemetry and other sensor input (i.e. IR sensors) to identify and lock onto a given target.     The systems developed will be lightweight, inexpensive, and easily transportable by the contemporary warfighter. Launching the munitions will be accomplished using either a mortar or a rifle, such as M16A1 equipped with a specially designed launcher (M203).     Small accurate munitions that can be launched by a lone warfighter will give the army significant tactical advantage, the ability to remain stealth, and capable of inflicting damage in any arena. The development of these technologies has many potential commercial applications, especially in the burgeoning UAV markets. These novel video systems will eventually be incorporated with other SBIR work to utilize conformal lithium ion battery technologies and miniaturized conformal electronics packages."

The current capabilities of XFS include basic Flight Management System (FMS), moving map, Primary Flight Display (PFD)\/Multi-Function Display (MFD), COMM Radio\/Transponder, Electronic Circuit Breakers (ECBs), mode control panel, environment control, flap and trim control, audio panel integration, and Global Positioning System (GPS)\/VHF Omni Directional Radio Range (VOR)\/Instrument Landing System (ILS) navigation.     The overall technical objective of this proposal is to investigate approaches to align the XFS architecture to the FACE architecture and research how the software implementations of the XFS modules can be adapted to be FACE conformant UoPs. The goal is to find the approach that takes advantage of the enhanced openness provided by the XFS software licensing to further speed the addition of new software capabilities and new hardware devices."

(C2Si), cooperating with Professor Steve Nutt of University of Southern California (USC), proposes to develop a low-cost, versatile, durable and structural properties enhancing metallic coating process for near net-shape plastic structural parts. C2Sis innovation is in the use of a cold spray technique to deposit optimum thickness of metal coating that enables minimum weight structural near net-shape parts. C2Si is proposing to utilize high-pressure cold spraying to deposit a metallic layer on plastics or short-fiber reinforced plastics to improve stiffness and strength of structural parts with minimal added weight. Cold spray deposited metals exhibit exceptional mechanical properties, and grain size and structure can generally be maintained from the powdered state to the as-deposited condition. The C2Si team possesses in-depth knowledge and direct experience of improving the cold spray deposition process (USC) coupled with modeling of advanced composite structures and low-cost environmentally suitable manufacturing process development for advanced composite structures (C2Si). Note that the thickness needed to enhance specific stiffness and strength cannot be processed cost effectively and by environmentally friendly process steps by competing deposition techniques. The C2Si team will demonstrate metal coating process and produce testing results at proof-of- performance level."

These designs often utilize a series of geometrical-complex brackets, bulkheads, and housing designs in order to minimize packing space and optimize attachment schemes. This program presents an opportunity to develop lightweight, high performance (stiffness, strength, durable), geometrically complex missile components to serve as brackets, bulkheads, housings, or covers. The approach will combine three major technologies: (1) advanced material systems, such as fiber filled molding compounds for balanced properties and cost, (2) state-out-the art material fabrication techniques, such as additive manufacturing to create highly detailed components, and (3) priority plating techniques to promote durability and mutilifunctionality (damage tolerance, thermal and electrical property enhancements). While each technology is well-understood when used separately, a strategy for combining all three technologies is still need in order to deliver optimal mechanical performance. Thus, this program focuses on design optimization and tailoring of these technologies to missile application rather than pure scientific advancement of un-proven materials."

Our past projects have been in conjunction with numerous agencies including the US Army, the US Navy, and large defense prime contractors.  In this proposal, we will leverage our recent experience to develop a low-profile antenna array system that can simultaneously handle high peak and average powers from HPEM sources in a nearly conformal configuration that is compact enough to integrate onto an MRAP or similar ground vehicle."

Under difficult and rapidly changing downrange conditions, successful engagement often hinges on rapid follow-up shots with an applied corrective hold. The limits of depth perception prevent spotters from adequately estimating the precise point at which the observed bullet trace corresponds to the vertical plane of the target. Herein lays the problem: there is no commercially available system which is specifically designed for tracking precision rifle fire.Lynntech will provide a multi-spectral computer vision based system for bullet tracking and determining the sniper missed-distance corrective offset. Lynntechs bullet tracking and correction tool minimizes the time between initial engagement and successful re-engagement while simultaneously increases the probability of a hit on target. Lynntech and its assembled team is uniquely qualified for this task, uniting institutional knowledge and individual experience in ballistics, electro-optical imaging, computer vision, and sniper TTPs.

        "abstract": "The goal for a sniper is one shot, one kill. However, there are circumstances where a second shot is necessary. The goal is to take the second shot as quickly as possible, minimizing the changes in windage or target position. Accuracy of the second shot can be significantly improved if the miss distance of the first shot is known with high accuracy.   Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) and AAI\/Textron Systems (AAI) will develop TIPOFF, a spotter assist system that will track the sniper bullet in flight, determine where it crosses the target plane and convert this information to miss distance. Whether trade studies indicate that disturbed air or infrared tracking is optimal, this is the ideal team to study, develop and implement the solution. The disturbed air solution amounts to replacing a highly-trained human with a camera and complex algorithms and the IR tracking solution amounts to undersampling the track of a fast moving bullet and extracting a high-resolution trajectory from low SNR data and then projecting it to the target plane. Regardless of the technique, quick rapid calculation of the missed distance will allow a rapid second shot with a very high probability of hit."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for lightweight, low-bulk, rugged, and launderable connectors for transport of power and data with no negative impact on the flame-retardant character of the materials Army aircrews wear while on duty, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop the new Launderable Enhanced Electrotextile Snap-Connector Arrangement (LEESA). It is based on a robust approach to seamless integration of electronics and textiles found in POCs family of e-wearables. Specifically, the innovation in low-profile, washable, self-sealing electrical interconnection with high data rate and low bit error rate will enable the LEESA connector to advance the state of the art in e-textiles while simultaneously preserving warfighter safety, which directly addresses Air Soldier requirements such as ruggedization against degradation from detergent, water, and agitation without impacting flame retardancy of the underlying garment, e-textile, or narrow fabric. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of LEESA by reaching technology readiness level (TRL)-3\/-4 in laboratory experiments and by modeling and simulation (M&amp;S). In Phase II, POC plans to develop an advanced prototype and perform validation and performance testing in conjunction with the Army, reaching TRL-5\/-6."

A key to achieving these goals is the integrated power, data, and communications links that connect the body borne equipment that make up these critical SA systems.While these enhanced capabilities will, ultimately, make the Army Aviator more informed, capable and survivable, they present some significant challenges for system wearability, comfort and performance.Nowhere is this challenge more magnified than in the area of Personal Area Network (PAN) cables and connectors.To meet this critical need, Human Systems Integration, Inc. (HSI), a leading developer of Wearable Electronics products and solutions, will develop and implement a new PAN connector system to ergonomically, ruggedly and reliably interconnect the complex electronic functionality of the modern Aviator ensemble. This objective PAN connector will be extremely low-profile and conformal, provide the requisite electrical performance, and prove to be extremely rugged in the typical Aviator environment. It will also meet Aviator equipment flame retardant standards and withstand ensemble laundering procedures."

        "abstract": "This effort will produce a design for an ultra-small size, ultra-low weight, ultra-low power (ultra-low SWaP) bi-directional tactical cross domain solution suitable for carriage by a dismounted soldier without increasing his physical load bearing burden. The CDS design will provide assured, filtered transfer of tactical command and control, situational awareness, and sensor data feeds between a classified wireless tactical network and unclassified sensors, data links and processing devices borne by the soldier. The CDS will prevent classified data spillage and cyber malware attacks through protocol and content aware deep content inspection of the data to be transferred governed by pre-programmed security policy rule sets. The approach will utilize proven, UCDSMO certified, COTS CDS software, a power efficient, high performance Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ multi-processor system on chip (MPSoC) Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with quad ARM processor cores and a secure, open source Xen hypervisor virtual machine environment to enforce domain separation. These proven COTS technologies will be combined with a small custom designed input\/output power management module featuring multi-port USB\/power distribution hubs on both the high and low sides of the CDS. The entire assembly will be designed to be packaged in a rugged, light weight enclosure."

        "abstract": "All DoD branches benefit from interoperable, robust, and accurate targeting systems for forward observers and terminal attack controllers. These systems allow personnel to report relative distance in terms of three measures:  observer current position (for example from reading a map or global navigation satellite systems, whose signal is subject to jamming), distance to target (by laser measurement, in general very reliable), and direction or angle towards the targetthe most critical being azimuth, or rotation from north. A magnetic compass is not sufficiently accurate or reliable; better are sky compasses which leverage astronomic observables, with reliable and consistent use scenarios. Sky compasses can function day or night when a celestial object is detectable.  Lynntech has assembled a team with exceptional insight for developing this desired upgrade, and we offer a particularly efficient route to a rigorously tested, reliable device. In addition we will develop custom algorithms, which help avoid IP and licensing issues. In Phase I we prove feasibility of our design by evaluating prototype components, and in Phase II we interface with stakeholders, build and test prototypes, and build an IP fence around our innovation."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for an augmented-reality (AR) live-fire training system, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Augmented-Reality Adaptive Live-Fire Training (AURALIT) system encompassing a head tracker and two visual subsystems: (1) a head-mounted display (HMD) for range scanning and (2) a weapon-mounted clip-on display for targeting. All subsystems communicate wirelessly with a central computer to generate the AR imagery. The monocular HMD supports a wide field of view without interfering with the shooters firing position. The compact clip-on display reproduces the scene as viewed through the weapon scope, regardless of scope type, thus preserving the original scopes eye relief. Finally, AURALITs AR fusion techniques require minimal image processing to add simulated target silhouettes and location of miss and hit (LOMAH) data to real-world scenery, thus ensuring an imperceptible latency. Thus, AURALIT will enable firearm training with real-time AR imagery. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate AURALITs feasibility as an integrated AR technology for training by generating real-time AR avatars and data, including simulated LOMAH positions. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a prototype capable of real-time AR scene generation, including LOMAH integration, at a live-fire range, to reach TRL-6."

The US Army is seeking to modernize Basic Rifleman Marksmanship (BRM) familiarization and qualification training by replacing the current pop-up, paper, and silhouette targets with an AR solution, coupled with a Location of Miss and Hit (LOMAH) system. This would enable more efficient, varied, comprehensive, and cost effective BRM training. AR technology will enable targets to be varied, allowing anything from silhouettes to tactically correct enemy models. Additionally, the targets could be scripted to move, pop-out from correct cover and concealment, and other advanced techniques. Environmental effects can also be simulated with AR technology, allowing advanced soldier training under a variety of conditions. Potential commercial applications for this technologyproviding an effective and improved training approachinclude, but are not limited to: law enforcement, sports shooting, and commercial\/private ranges (for pleasure and competitions). The technology could also be further expanded to be used without live fire, and thus be expanded to paintball, airsoft, etc."

        "abstract": "Infrared polarimetry has proven to enhance target detection and tracking in cluttered environments, and is of significant importance to high energy laser weapon targeting systems.  Modern state of the art infrared polarimeters possess numerous limitations that render them impractical for tracking at high slew-rates. Efforts have been made to implement micropolarization filters directly onto a focal plane array (FPA), however hybridized FPA technology limits performance through excessive polarization crosstalk and robustness issues caused by the need for back thinning.  HgTe colloidal quantum dot (CQD) FPAs, developed by Sivananthan Laboratories, are MWIR photon detectors, demonstrate high performance and fast response, have the potential for uncooled operation, and are monolithically integrated with readout integrated circuits. Monolithic integration enables the fabrication of micropolarizer array directly onto the absorber material, making high performance, compact, and robust polarimeters possible.  As experts in CQD FPA technology and computational modeling, we propose to develop plasmonic micropolarizer filter arrays, compatible with CQD technology, through computational modeling and fabrication process development as a part of the Phase I effort.  A compact and high performance polarimetric FPA will be developed with a resolution of 1344 x 784 and capable of operating at frame rates up to 4,380 fps (windowed)."

        "abstract": "QuantaSpec will modify its hyperspectral imager technology to develop a compact infrared polarimeter that has a SWAP footprint that is slightly greater than a thermal camera. Two approaches will be investigated.  One of the approaches measures the complete Stokes vector at full frame rate and full spatial resolution.   The prior art approach of using polarizers integrated on to a focal plane array (FPA) greatly degrades image resolution because a pixel is used for each polarization state. QuantaSpec&apos;s approach is superior to integrating filters on focal plane arrays (FPAs) because it does not use a pixel for each polarization state which preserves image resolution.   In addition, Quantaspec&apos;s approach is a Fourier approach which enables calibration to compensate for imperfect components or alignment.  Further, QuantaSpec&apos;s approach captures all elements of the Stokes vector simultaneously at full frame rate, unlike the prior art rotating polarizaer approach.  QuantaSpec&apos;s approach can work over much of the mid wave infrared and all of the long wave infrared.  Lastly QuantaSpec&apos;s approach uses no moving parts."

As fuel prices continue to increase and budgets are tightened, the military is concerned about reducing these costs.  In addition, the cost of a convoy with which to transport the fuel to remote locations takes a heavy tool in human life. This effort will be focused on ways to use novel engine modifications to improve fuel economy and power by examining the operating range currently used with this vehicle.  Diesel engines are designed primarily to produce maximum power while under load with the best fuel economy possible.  However, very often these vehicles are at rest, powering accessories, or are operating in a modality not requiring full power output.  These engines do not have a modality to produce only the required power at any given point.  Robotic Research, LLC intends to improve the fuel economy and power of military vehicles by exploring a range of improvements.  Specifically, we believe we can utilize our experience with Engine Control Management (ECM) improvements, as well as smart driving technology, to accomplish these goals."

        "abstract": "Ardica Technologies, Inc. has identified aluminum hydride, AlH3 or Alane, as a hydrogen storage material for ground vehicle fuel cell systems. Alane has 10.1% hydrogen by weight, and a volumetric energy density of 147 g H2\/L, significantly greater than compressed hydrogen. It operates at moderate temperature with minimal energy input, and does not require any pressure vessels. In this Phase I proposal Ardica will build a benchtop system to assess the feasibility of using Alane, and show its performance in comparison to compressed hydrogen. Ardica will then create an analytical model of a large Alane cartridge, and conduct experiments to establish material properties which will improve the model accuracy. The results of this will establish the performance and cost of a scaled-up prototype hydrogen storage system. As an option, Ardica will develop a system model to investigate different system architectures for a scaled-up Alane hydrogen fuel cell powered ground vehicle. The validation of Alanes feasibility, and the results of these models will enable Ardica to create a large-scale prototype during a Phase II proposal."

These strategizes will determine the number of interceptors to be launched, their launch times, which threats they will engage, and will coordinate their flight paths to enhance lethality and lower cost. This algorithm will be developed using a two-tiered approach. First create a large database of optimized strategies spanning many different threat scenarios by using global optimization techniques such as evolutionary algorithms or covariance matrix adaptation. Second use this database to train a neural network to create optimized strategies in real time. This algorithm will be customized to the specific capabilities and limitations of a particular interceptor system through comprehensive simulation in order to cover the complete range of potential threat scenarios."

Desired lethality levels are driving system designs that leverage increasingly complex subsystems.  This increase in complexity incurs an increase in cost (per-interceptor cost).  The innovation presented here will achieve the desired lethality levels by leveraging advanced system architectures rather than advanced systems.  By pursuing novel engagement capability, cost effective systems performing at or above desired standards can be utilized.    These alternative capability concepts include, but may not be limited to, leader-follower guided missiles, collaborative or cooperative guided missile engagements with multiple interceptors, learning algorithms for guidance of multiple missile interceptors, and optimization of multiple guided missiles for distributed lethality.  Therefore, the Cintel team will create a set of tools allowing the tradeoff analysis of different engagement architectures.  This will require the definition of new objective functions to enable the optimization of architectures.  The key deliverable for this Phase I effort will be the definition and evaluation of key defensive\/offensive missile architecture concepts with performance valuation for each concept.  Additionally, preparation for Phase II will include a proposal on a concept down-selection and maturation plan."

In this proposal, an integration effort is presented to leverage several years of DoD investment in weather requirements research to develop an in situ weather assessment capability for autonomous weather decision support in the PATRIOT missile system. When applied to several systems, this capability provides broader battlespace weather awareness and response. The proposed technology will support AMD users in training, combat readiness planning, and engagement response. Phase I will focus on developing an approach for integrating relevant DoD invested technologies into a seamless working process. In Phase II, a prototype system will be developed in preparation for operational testing. A part of the transition effort will also target user training, allowing the user to shape the future of the capability. The successful completion of this effort will provide the process for a game changing technology whereby contemporary weather information is effectively treated as an actor in the battlespace."

        "abstract": "Supercapacitors have emerged as energy storage devices exhibiting higher energy densities than traditional capacitors, as well as higher power densities than batteries or fuel cells. Current supercapacitor technology is limited by the operational temperature range of the electrolyte. This proposal will investigate deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as a novel class of electrolytes to enable high-performance supercapacitors with an operating temperature range between -45 C to 65 C. By contrast, aqueous electrolytes are limited to above-zero temperatures (freezing point of water) and have a low breakdown voltage (~ 1.2 V). Although organic electrolytes operate over a larger temperature range and exhibit higher breakdown voltages (~ 2.5 V), they also possess much lower conductivities, and correspondingly lower power densities for the supercapacitor, and can be highly flammable. DESs are expected to display wider operational temperature ranges and larger electrochemical stability windows (breakdown voltage in the range 3-7 V) as compared with conventional aqueous or organic electrolytes, resulting in supercapacitors exhibiting higher energy and power densities. The proposed approach utilizes a combination of experimental and supercomputing methods that will simultaneously maximize the probability of success and minimize the cost-per-eutectic investigated."

        "abstract": "In response to the defined need for improve conditions for warfighters to avoid problematic fungal skin infections, Luna Innovations is proposing the development of the Agastache antifungal textile treatment: a novel method to specifically target and kill pathogenic fungi.  Agastache is envisioned as a platform textile treatment, capable of being permanently applied to any common textile, and will have fast acting antifungal effects on pathogenic fungi in close proximity, however not on any other members of the normal healthy skin flora.  The Agastache platform technology has applications for specific targeting of other infectious microorganisms as well, both as a textile treatment, and potentially as an administered therapeutic.    The Agastache fabric treatment technology will be demonstrated in laboratory-scale microbial growth conditions and assays.  Successful discrimination of pathogenic fungi and commensal microbial species by the Agastache antifungal technology when attached to a solid support will enable the further development of a textile-based testing system."

This project will exploit our extremophilic microbiome drug discovery (EMDD) platform by state-of-the-art (SOTA) synthetic biology methods to discover novel targeted antifungals in a high throughput manner.  Target\/commensal specificity will be measured by minimum inhibitory and lethal concentration (MIC\/MLC) assays against targets: Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum, and commensals: Malassezia furfur, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus, and Propionibacteria. The specificity goal is a 2-fold lower MIC and\/or MLC in targets compared to commensals over 24 hours.  Targeted antifungal(s) will undergo further purification and chemical analysis by mass spectrometry to characterize the compound(s).  Finally, production will be optimized and scaled up, and best textile application methods determined for the targeted antifungal molecules."

Phase II will develop 3.0Ah prototype cells and demonstrate the functionality over a wide-temperature range, under select environmental, storage, and cycling conditions. In addition, Navitas will initiate the scale-up and design processes and develop a preliminary cost structure for the production of battery systems &gt;250 Wh\/kg and &gt;4kW\/kg."

        "abstract": "This proposal concerns the utilization of recently developed erbium-doped GaAs (GaAs:Er) containing ErAs quantum dots at approximately 2% volumetric concentration.  Such GaAs:Er displays optimal THz performance because of excellent optical and electron-transport properties for driving at room temperature with 1550-nm lasers.  The absorption coefficient at 1550 nm is &gt; 5000 cm-1, the electron mobility is &gt; 2000 cm2\/V-s, and the dark resistivity is &gt; 105 ohm-cm.  The proposed Baseline Phase-I effort will commence with studying the uniformity and reliability of the electron and THz behavior in test devices at the (3.0-inch) wafer scale. It will then improve the performence even further using thicker epitaxial layers (2.0 compared to 1.0 um) and silicon nitride antireflection coating to improve the external quantum efficiency, and a better antenna (twin-slot) to improve the impedance matching to the THz device and therefore the available power for radiation into free space.  Finally, the Optional Phase-I effort  will focus on the 1550-nm optical-fiber coupling using industry-standard pigtailing techniques to allow arrays of such devices to be driven more efficiently and packaged more robustly, than what has been done in the past."

Interconnection to focal plane readout circuit is proposed using an application specific integrated circuit to receive the read out data and electrically drive the VCSEL to transmit the data. The micro transmitter and micro receiver include integrated lens for collimation and high alignment tolerance. In order to overcome reliability  and detuning problems faced by commercial off the shelf oxide VCSELs, a lithographic oxide-free VCSEL is proposed for the cryogenic laser. Scaling to single data channel speed to &gt; 50 Gbps is proposed due to compact packaging and short lead lengths of the micro optical components. Scaling to high channel count is also possible using single mode VCSEL arrays for wide alignment tolerances of VCSEL and detector arrays."

Cooled focal plane array technology is found in many Army missile guidance systems, such as the FGM-148 Javelin. By using free-space optics to collect data from the ROIC through a window in the dewar, it is possible not only to provide a large bandwidth interconnect but to also eliminate the thermal conduction losses through copper wires, which in turn will reduce the Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) of the system."

        "abstract": "Lead acid batteries, currently used in 95% of military ground vehicles, represent in excess of $100M per year in maintenance costs.  Furthermore, the failure modes of these batteries are such that they provide no indication of impending failure.  The batteries simply do not function, leaving the warfighter exposed and unequipped with no prior warning.  The ability to diagnose state of battery health and provide prognostics on remaining useful life ensures early detection of impending faults while simultaneously reducing burdens associated with battery maintenance.  To provide visibility into lead acid battery health conditions, Luna proposes to develop a multi-modal battery evaluation system using electrical impedance spectroscopy and dynamic electrical characteristic monitoring techniques to perform in-service diagnostics and prognostics.  This monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics system for lead acid batteries (MDP LAB) will enable maintainers to identify impending faults, ascertain failure modes including loss of electrolyte, sulfation, and acid stratification, and respond with required maintenance actions prior to system failures. The system will leverage both static voltage and current characteristics along with dynamic load switching profiles and electrochemical characterizations of the battery to identify incipient faults, impending failures, and remaining service life."

They find application in a range of vehicle starting applications as well as a wide array of deep cycle uses such as grid storage, backup power and deep cycle power on a range of commercial, utility, first responder, and military vehicles. Despite being around for over 100 years, there remains no good way of determining the state of charge and diagnosing a range of potential recoverable and non-recoverable degradation faults. Mainstream proposes to develop a range of predictive models that are based on highly sensitive electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that couples battery state both at open circuit and under load. These models will estimate the real-time state of charge and capacity of the battery. Moreover, these models will be designed to identify several key conditions in the cells; which, if uncorrected, can lead to degradation and failure of the battery. These conditions include surface charge, sulfonation of the electrodes, electrode stratification and corrosion of the current collector grid in the positive electrode. In Phase II, Mainstream will incorporate these predictive models into battery monitoring module to provide feedback on early corrective strategies and provide real-time battery state of charge measurements."

        "abstract": "In this SBIR solicitation, the Army has identified a need to develop a highly accurate and efficient finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic wave propagation software that is portable onto high performance computers (HPCs). The software shall be able to simulate electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation at High Frequency (HF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) bands. Applications include modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) of mobile radio network performance in a large dense urban environment. XL Scientific proposes to build a full-wave simulation software that solves Maxwells equations using a discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD) domain decomposition (DD) method. Use of the DD technique will enable us to handle multi-scale, extreme-size computational domains. The DD method requires decomposition of the computational domain into smaller subdomains. Each subdomain is gridded independently with an unstructured mesh. Then the Maxwells equations are discretized to a system of semi-discrete ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Both explicit and implicit solvers will be developed for solving the ODEs. Theoretically, the explicit method will be equivalent to the FDTD method. But the DGTD method is more flexible and efficient than the FDTD in terms of dealing with complex geometries and time integration. The software will be parallelized and runs on distributed-memory HPC computers."

        "abstract": "Current military batteries are flammable and suffer from insufficient specific energy, which create safety and tactical burden for the soldiers. The use of solid-state batteries may offer enhanced safety and energy density; however, current solid-state technology typically relies on metallic lithium anode, which cannot be rapidly charged or discharged at low temperatures and is unsafe if exposed to air or water. Lynntech proposes to develop a conformal safe solid-state (CS3) high energy and high power lithium-ion battery (LIB) by using the combination of high-capacity flexible silicon anodes, lithium-rich layered oxide cathodes, as well as flexible and conductive solid electrolytes. This approach will offer a CS3 battery with a long cycle life over a wide operating temperature range, high rate capability, low inherent materials and systems safety risks that can conform to the desired shape. During Phase I, Lynntech will develop all solid-state Li-ion cells, and evaluate the capacity, rate capability, cycle life, specific energy, and specific power at the full cell level. Flexibility testing will also be performed. During Phase II, Lynntech will develop a prototype CS3 battery to meet the Armys performance requirements. Lynntech will also perform preliminary cell abuse tolerance testing and design of scalable cell manufacturing."

(Solid Power) proposes to advance its solid-state battery system to exceed the energy density, stability, and safety of conventional Li-ion cells while also allowing for mechanical flexibility. Solid Power will leverage its highly energy dense solid state material system while replacing the typical Li metal anode with a high capacity alloy anode.

The solution includes onboard sensor hosting and communication with an intelligent autonomous system (IAS) swarm and ground control. AERO can leverage favorable environmental conditions to expand flight time, improving the swarms mission capabilities. AEROs innovative architecture allows for integration of various environmental sensor type for route optimization and collective data sharing. With its dual-mode capabilities, AERO is designed to function by ingesting data grids and sharing onboard sensor data. When connectivity is not available, AERO becomes self-reliant, using internally-stored data and sensors to continue the mission.AERO can be further expanded to additional Defense and Government (e.g. FAA, NASA) needs as well as other emergent federal, civil, and commercial applications (e.g. Homeland Security and Customs, Border Patrol, UAS manufacturers, Amazon, Google, etc.)."

Such high-throughput front-ends support broadband data transmission (multi-Gbit\/s) for a wide variety of sensors and unmanned platforms in situational awareness, monitoring, and reconnaissance. Their wideband nature also supports the deployment of broadband communication\/radar combo-systems, as well as numerous emerging commercial applications such as 5G networks, augmented reality (AR)\/virtual reality (VR) devices, and hyperspectral imaging systems.The transmitter often governs the total output power, energy consumption, linearity, and bandwidth of the communication\/radar front-end, which respectively determines the communication distance, energy efficiency, signal-fidelity\/emission, and modulation rates. Although mm-Wave transmitters supports large signal bandwidth, existing designs exhibit limited output power and compromised efficiency, in particular at deep power-back-off (PBO) situation. Moreover, the linearity of such high-throughput transmitters cannot be enhanced using conventional techniques, such as feedback-based digital pre-distortion (DPD), which are unable to support multi-Gbit\/s bandwidth and require impractical baseband computation complexity.In phase I of this SBIR project, Digital Analog Integration, Inc. and Georgia Tech team will work closely to investigate, design, and simulate watt-level broadband dual-mode mixed-signal mm-wave Doherty transmitter in all-silicon and silicon\/GaN heterogeneous integration platforms with our novel Doherty PA based highly efficient transmitter architecture."

        "abstract": "The Army has an ever-growing need to provide electric power to soldiers on the battlefield.  Of particular need is an efficient, power dense, jet fuel-powered system for charging batteries.  The Army has invested heavily in thermal-to-electric power conversion, most notably in thermoelectric generators or TEGs.  Because the conversion efficiency of TEGs is relatively low, and because the hot side temperature of high efficiency TEGs is high, a high efficiency recuperated burner is needed to achieve high conversion efficiency for the overall system.  This topic calls for a high efficiency burner technology for thermal-to-electric battery changing in the 30 We power range.  We propose to develop a unique, recuperated burner for this application capable of operating on jet fuel or a range of other conventional fuels including gaseous fuels, biodiesel, and gasoline.  Our burner technology is general and could be applied to different thermal-to-electric conversion technology including TEGs and thermophotovoltaic systems (TPV).  In Phase I, we will complete a system-level design to define requirements for our burner, and then prototype and test an initial embodiment of the burner.  In Phase II, we will iterate the burner design and integrate and demonstrate the burner in a prototype battery charging system."

Over the years, many new and innovative technologies have emerged that have made some progress towards this goal, but the gap between high performance and low-cost has been difficult to bridge, until recently.  Since the development of colloidal quantum dots, which can be synthesized readily with simple low-cost equipment, there has been a significant push towards developing a CQD IR camera.  We propose innovative chemical reactions to make well-passivated air-stable MWIR absorbing CQDs that are n and p-type.  We also propose an innovative method to deposit p and n-type CQDs that will yield superior charge transport properties  yielding IR devices with a high quantum efficiency (&gt;30 %).  The successful completion of our Phase I effort will ultimately lead to the development of a low-cost MWIR CQD IR camera."

        "abstract": "Environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) are coating systems that are applied to the surface of Si-based ceramics resulting in protection against moisture-assisted oxidation-induced ceramic recession. These coatings require many attributes to be successful including: good stability in the presence of water vapor; a mechanism for limiting the transport of oxygen and water vapor to the ceramic substrate; good chemical compatibility at the interface; high temperature phase stability, to limit volume changes resulting from phase transformations in the coating materials; and the ability to provide thermal protection. These requirements also must be retained in the presence of particle laden environments. Particle interactions with the coating systems in service can result in both the gradual removal of material (i.e., erosion) and the cracking and immediate removal of significant amounts of material (i.e., impact or foreign object damage). At higher engine operating temperatures, particles ingested in the engine will melt and result in the formation of glassy deposits on engine components that reduce coating durability.  The work is this program is designed to utilize a baseline T\/EBC system and, then, incorporate and test multiple protection concepts that are anticipated to result in improved durability in particle laden environments."

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposed SBIR project is to develop a computational tool capable of predicting the atomization of liquid injected through a practical I.C. Engine fuel injector under realistic operating conditions. The goal of the present study is to advance an existing state-of-the-art simulation methodology in several areas to substantially reduce the computational cost while still providing a predictive capability of the atomization process. To achieve this goal, a hybrid volume-of-fluid method (VoF) will be developed that enriches the interface reconstruction with Lagrangian marker particles to improve the ability to capture under-resolved interfacial structures. The breakup of under-resolved liquid structures will be modeled by theoretical instability theory to predict post-breakup droplet sizes. The resulting droplets are then represented in a Lagrangian particle\/parcel description and undergo secondary atomization with evaporation. In this modeling approach, a significant reduction in computational cost will be achieved by relaxing the severe resolution requirements of thin ligaments and sheets\/bags in high Weber number flows. During Phase I, efforts will be made to develop the subgrid breakup model based on the hybrid VoF method and to validate using the problem of turbulent atomization of liquid fuel with comparison to Direct Numerical Simulation data and experimental measurements."

        "abstract": "In propulsion systems, liquid fuel is atomized and burned in a way that maximizes engine efficiency and minimizes emissions. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to design injectors and nozzles that lead to adequate mixing of fuel and air. Unfortunately, mathematical models of liquid atomization for CFD are still far from adequate to design injectors and nozzles. This atomization has been divided into three stages (i) primary atomization in which the liquid jet breaks into blobs of fluid termed primary drops henceforth; (ii) secondary atomization in which these primary drops break further into smaller drops; and, (iii) the later evolution of the spray. It is evident that the primary-atomization stage sets the initial conditions for all subsequent processes. Thus, the accurate modeling of primary atomization is critical for the overall accurate modeling of atomization. Unfortunately, primary atomization is the least understood of these three processes. Classic models need a calibration process that is onerous because primary atomization involves many physical parameters disregard most of the physics. Combustion Science &amp; Engineering, Inc. proposes a solution to the above dilemma by developing a novel subgrid-scale (sgs) model of primary atomization based on the so-called Linear-Eddy Model (LEM) \/ One-Dimensional-Turbulence (ODT) framework."

        "abstract": "Fuel injection is a strongly multi-physical process, involving the effects of droplet breakup, deformation, atomization, evaporation, turbulence, and non-ideal thermodynamics, among others, not all of which are strictly deterministic at the present time. In the work proposed here, HyPerComp Inc. seeks to transition an advanced high-fidelity simulation software suite (being used extensively in aero-propulsion) to model heavy fuel injectors at high injection pressures. The solver will be built upon a Large Eddy Simulation code written for turbulent combustion. It will deploy a free surface capture method in the vicinity of the injector where the flowfield is dense (i.e., high liquid volume fraction), and couple it to a Lagrangian spray model in the far-field where the flow is dilute. We will augment this code with sub-models for spray properties, leading to a tool capable of modeling primary atomization and jet penetration, as well as dispersion, evaporation and mixing, with particular emphasis on high-pressure injection systems. The staff at HyPerComp Inc. has close to three decades of association with computational fluid dynamics modeling in aeronautical applications. HyPerComp will work jointly in this project with Prof. Suresh Menon of the Computational Combustion Laboratory (CCL) at the Georgia Institute of Technology."

Advanced cycle engines which generate large amounts of electrical power either for weapons or electric propulsion, while retaining the capability to directly propel the vehicle are necessary. Requirements exist for sustained high altitude operations of UAVs which would normally tax the system in terms of power generation capabilities. In the Phase I effort Spytek plans to leverage assets from its recent Phase II and current phase III SBIR efforts with AFRL. These assets include the dual ITB FI304 engine which was tested under a Phase II and has high interest for potential use from UAV builders. Using Spyteks innovative Inter Turbine Burner (ITB) technology, variable nozzle guide vanesand J304 engine core, Spytek proposes the advanced cycle TI304 engine, an ITB equipped turbo-shaft engine for high altitude UAV use, with capability for low altitude VTOL type hybrid operations in response to this solicitation.What is proposed is an advanced cycle, hybrid operation capable, turbo-shaft engine designed for high altitude operations while not compromising power generation capabilities at low altitude."

Recently,SHEPRA and its development partner the University of Dayton demonstrated a carbon nanotube metal matrix composites produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) that demonstrated a 16% increase in elastic modulus and 22% increase in yield strength at 2% carbon nanotube volume loading.These results are consistent with academic literature that shows a 50% increase in modulus and 100% increase in strength at 5% carbon nanotube volume loading in aluminum. These results will meet the requirements of this program.SHEPRA will leverage prior experience to deliver to the Army a carbon nanotubealuminum metal matrix composite for use in Additive Manufacturing of long rod penetrator sabots that utilizes commercial off the shelf materials and AM manufacturing systems. In addition a supply chain has been established that integrates a DOD prime OEM to ensure successful technology transition and commercialization."

        "abstract": "The use of kinetic energy projectiles relies on a sabot structure to trap and transfer the expanding propellant energy to the penetrator.  While the sabot is critical to projectile acceleration, it negatively affects the lethality performance of the penetrator.  Therefore, lighter sabots are needed to increase penetrator kinetic energy.  While traditional composite methods developed for large caliber projectiles have been successful, these approaches have not been scalable for small and medium caliber projectiles.  Corvid Technologies proposes to design a new sabot utilizing a light weight metallic support structure with a polymer overmold. This methodology differs from those previous by shifting the problem from material design to structural design. The sabot structure will be designed with topology optimization to yield an optimal lightweight metal structure. This structure will be fabricated using additive manufacturing which affords both rapid fabrication and the realization of optimal solutions unattainable through traditional manufacturing.  A polymer overmold is applied to structurally reinforce the sabot and maintain the current designs near-net external geometry. In this way, the metal structure and polymer overmold are designed in tandem to achieve optimal structural, aerodynamic, and kinetic energy performance.  Corvid will provide material testing to validate material properties and performance."

        "abstract": "Missile launcher armor is needed to protect propellants from unintended ignition when struck by ballistic projectiles and fragments.  Allowing fragments to penetrate the armor at low speed limits the chance of ignition while lightening the armor.  The closely-spaced shot pattern and thickness and weight limits still make a significant design challenge.  Safe has selected materials suitable for the threat, which are the highest-performing ballistic materials that can be commercialized in the ground vehicle market.  The approach eschews simulation and moves directly to testing to demonstrate feasibility.  Tests are framed within a Design of Experiments approach that develops a design equation from test data on coupons built at potential design points, to assure that the lightest possible design is found that meets all requirements.  The project team includes engineers with extensive experience designing and producing armor.  The commercialization plan relies on the relatively low cost of the materials to foster widespread market penetration, and includes a potential strategic partner for high rate manufacturing or surge demand.  The combination of a statistically based design approach, thoughtful material selection, experienced team, and solid commercialization plan assure the best possible chance to solve this problem and commercialize the resulting product."

        "abstract": "Currently Army missiles are vulnerable to bullet and fragment impact even when housed within their protective canisters. Missile canisters are generally made of lightweight metalsor composites offering little defense from ballistic impacts. Recent advances in Insensitive Munitions (IM) lightweight armor design indicate the feasibility of a solution for developing practical MIL-STD-2105D compliant canisters. Bullet and fragment impact test data has demonstrated effective impact resistant armor applicable to canister design, making them compatible with both space and weight constraints of typical mobile missile launchers and handling equipment weight limitations.American Technical Coatings, Inc. (DBA ATC Materials, Inc.) of Westlake, OH is a leader in IM armor technologies and is currently producing the NAVY\/MDA qualified MIL-STD-2105D Type VI+ Transportation Protection System (TPS).ATCs lightweight armor for canisters is an offshoot of TPS technology and has demonstrated successful IM response reduction of energetic materials in several Army tests.This armor can be easily fitted to any canister or missile launcher, providing enhanced warfighter safety and preservation of scarce munitions so critical during combat operations. Lightweight armor technology can also be used for related applications such as ballistic shields for protection of personnel or hazardous and high-value cargo."

        "abstract": "Personnel and vehicle ballistic armor can be damaged in handling and use, and by severe ballistic and shock impact.  Dropping a ceramic armor plate onto a hard surface, or diving for cover, could fracture the ceramic, cause fiber\/matrix damage in the retention layer, or could de-laminate any of the adjacent layers.  Adhesive bonds can degrade slowly over time and their integrity is highly dependent on the surface preparation when applied.  A field portable unit is acute for the deployed testing of body armor and vehicle ballistic armor at the point of manufacture, field testing in active combat zones, and depot testing as deployed armor is recovered and stored for future use.  Novel non-linear acoustic and impact resonance NDI techniques are proposed to detect submillimeter delamination of ceramic-composite interfaces.  These techniques can identify micro-deformations and micro-cracking before they evolve into critical defects capable of weakening or threatening the structural integrity of the material, detect weaknesses in adhesive bonds before they disbond; and identify millimeter cracks in ceramics.  NLA Diagnostics is uniquely qualified to deliver a field portable unit based on its current RECON, a portable instrument designed to accurately detect and assess micro-cracks and fractures in structures using multiple NDI techniques."

        "abstract": "The Army uses software applications and databases throughout its tactical systems to provide mission critical services.  With mission software moving towards laptops and mobile devices in network disconnected environments, there is a need for a single-instance database solution which provides cell-level visibility with data provenance as information traverses the database.  This will allow the Army to enforce protection of database information through third-party applications.  Architecture Technology Corp (ATCorp) proposes SecureDBC, a software Application Provider Interface (API) product to provide database cell-level visibility to applications while tracking data provenance.  SecureDBC protects information stored in a database and only allows applications to view database query results (at the cell-level) if they are permitted access.  In addition, SecureDBC maintains pedigree and provenance information of data stored and accessed through the database.  SecureDBC will be designed similarly to the Open Database Connector (ODBC) API and architecture which enables it to be application and database agnostic.  This will reduce development costs of Army applications by mimicking standard database connectors familiar to programmers."

As spectrum congestion increases, through spectrum auctions such as AWS-3 for example, the impact of cosite and adjacent channel interference on radio operations will increase. For example, JTRS training sites operating in the 1755-1850 MHz band may experience more interference from cellular transmissions. Similarly, meteorological ground stations operating in the 1695-1710 MHz band may experience more interference from cellular uplink transmissions. Position, navigation and timing (PNT) signals such as Global Positioning System (GPS) are among the weakest signals received at a receiver. Therefore, these receivers will be impacted the most because of cosite interference due to tactical radio operations in for example 1750-1850 MHz."

Operations in an increasingly congested electromagnetic spectrum, constantly intensifying demand for data at the tactical edge, and the diminishing extent of electromagnetic spectrum provisioned for the military has resulted in the need for advanced technologies to mitigate Global Positioning System (GPS) interference due to co-site interference with C4ISR . Metamagnetics FSL technology has the potential to provide the Army with a powerful innovative interference mitigation tool that is much needed on the battlefield. Unlike other common approaches such as tunable filter banks, antenna radiation pattern adjustment and signal diversity, the FSL is a completely passive high power RF signal processing tool. Current SOA methods fall short in that they require copious extra components to sense and tune the electronics to mitigate the interference, or they rely on geometry and position of antenna elements, which can be difficult to maintain while moving and is cumbersome. The FSL is a compact passive device that can be placed in the RF front end to protect sensitive downstream components without compromising or taking away from the overall system performance."

This device is based on a design utilizing planar elements backed by an artificial magnetic conductor for size reduction. Specifically, the LOMUA system will radiate efficiently in the frequency bands of interest (gain = -3 dB at UHF, gain = 0 dB at L-band), and have a 360 deg operational azimuth, while supporting both right-hand and left-hand circular polarization. In Phase I POC will develop a proof-of-concept electrically small, multiband antenna through simulation and analysis, and will perform sufficient analysis to verify that the designed antenna can efficiently radiate frequencies in the UHF and L-band and meet the required antenna capabilities. In Phase II, POC plans to optimize the LOMUA design, quantifying performance metrics and enhancing the design through modification, and to fabricate and deliver a prototype. POC will also prepare a transition plan and evaluate LOMUA in a representative vehicular platform environment at technology readiness level (TRL)-5\/-6."

These new waveforms require significant bandwidth and efficiency from the corresponding RF sensors.

When operating high power radios in close proximity to one another, it is just as important to clean up the transmit spectrum as well as the receive spectrum to maintain good signal to noise ratio and link performance. Indiana Microelectronics is proposing a bank of reconfigurable filters using solid state switches and varactor diodes to cover a wide band of interest with fast tuning speeds, while still maintaining enough linearity to operate in the transmit path of a radio. The ability to control the center frequency, bandwidth, and number of poles of the filters will allow the system to optimize performance across a wide range of operational environments. The use of reconfigurable resonators consisting of lumped-element and substrate-integrated components where necessary allows for a compact, high performance, multi-pole design that can fit into applications where size and weight are critical."

        "abstract": "There is a growing interest in shifting the wavelength of ultra-short pulse (USP) lasers systems to new spectral regimes, in order to harness the unique properties of USP lasers for new applications. For many of these applications high peak powers, on the order of terawatts (TWs), are desired. Due to the lack of laser gain media that are able to produce emission directly at mid-IR frequencies, current laser technology relies on nonlinear processes to generate light in this region of the spectrum. Optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) has been shown as a viable method for generating TW peak powers; however, these systems often utilize complex geometries and several stages of nonlinear conversion to reach the mid-IR. In an effort to simplify these systems and provide a path from laboratory proof-of-principle to fieldable technology, Q-Peak is offering an enabling technology that replaces the complex optical setups required to generate broadband, ultra-short, seed pulses with a monolithic, alignment-free, optical fiber based approach. Q-Peak will develop and demonstrate nonlinear conversion of ultra-short pulses to mid-IR frequencies using Raman-assisted Soliton Self-Frequency Shifting (SSFS) in IR transmissive optical fibers which can be used as a seed for high peak power OPCPA laser systems."

        "abstract": "To address the Army need to automatically detect and track small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) from ground vehicles equipped with distributed aperture systems (DAS) of infrared (IR) cameras, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop new software for Automated Detection, Identification and Tracking of Unmanned Aerial Systems (ADITUAS), based on an innovative combination of machine vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms will enable real-time extraction of data relevant to counter-UAS (CUAS) systems from raw DAS output. The algorithms will work on moving DAS platforms, being able to filter out platform movement before attempting UAS detection. Specifically, innovations in image registration, in using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect moving objects in cluttered environments, and in structure-from-motion (SFM) ranging will enable the software to detect, identify, and track UAS using DAS video output, and optionally translate UAS positions to 3D world coordinate systems. As a result, the software will provide actionable input to CUAS systems, which directly addresses the Army requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the ADITUAS approach by developing a Technology Readiness Level (TRL)-3 software implementation. In Phase II, POC will build a TRL 6 ADITUAS system based on COTS GPU hardware."

        "abstract": "Driving ground vehicles in heavily degraded visual environments brings significant risk since course corrections cannot be made safely without visual cues. Infrared imagery can improve visibility in degraded visual environments, however when heavily degraded, this method alone is insufficient. Noise sources can be rapidly categorized and suppressed in near real-time by applying modern image processing techniques with machine-learning-based classification strategies. Noise sources will first be analyzed in degraded imagery including the temporal component of the noise. A supervised machine learning approach will categorize these noise sources, allowing for rapid identification of the optimal noise removal method. These noise signatures will be next replicated, and then transforms developed that can repair damage done by such noise sources. Finally, a limited scope implementation will be done to ensure high-speed application of these image enhancements is suitable while driving a vehicle. Phase II efforts will fully implement the method and target below 80 ms latency.  Phase III efforts will focus on widespread implementation."

Locating ADC function in-pixel will provide much higher dynamic range and frame rate for uncooled longwave infrared (LWIR) imaging in large array formats. Benefits are also expected for production costs, signal-to-noise ratio, and CMOS foundry flexibility for commercial applications. The proposed Phase I effort will show, by design, proof of concept of digital in-pixel circuitry to achieve 1280x1024 format imaging in 12 m pixel pitch with 16-bits signal dynamic range and frame rate 240 Hz. The Black Forest Engineering (BFE) ADC approach utilizes an ADC circuit compatible with both scaled CMOS and 3D IC stacking. On Phase I, BFE will compare implementation methods addressing performance, cost, and risk. On Phase II the all-digital ROIC will be fabricated with bolometers and wafer level vacuum packaging. The ROIC will be integrated into a camera system prototype to demonstrate capability (performance and features) of digital in-pixel circuitry."

        "abstract": "Warfighters responsible for planning and conducting A2\/AD entry operations require up-to-date, high-quality information within dynamic littoral zones. We plan to develop an easily deployable day-night measurement capability to accurately measure bathymetry, topography, currents and water surface temperature in near real-time from sensors and small computing capabilities housed within small multi-rotor vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UASs. For decades it has been known that nearshore bathymetry can be estimated using gravity wave dispersion relationships derived from a sequential set of downward-looking images (time series), but the current implementation is insufficient to meet the needs of the warfighter. Our approach integrates the cBathy and three-dimensional Fourier based gravity wave dispersion algorithms using thermal and visible imagery to produce robust nearshore bathymetry with a well-understood uncertainty estimate. The sensitivity of the algorithms to direct georeferencing will be explored to reduce the need for ground control points and fiducials for nighttime operation. Structure from Motion techniques using both visible and thermal imagery will generate topographic subaerial dense point clouds with RGB and temperature overlays. Small low power computing components will enable on-board real-time processing so information can be transmitted to ground personnel in near real-time."

        "abstract": "The Army desires observations of an area over time in order to perform littoral terrain estimates, hydrodynamics estimation, and estimation of geological properties in turbid environments. Analysis options include 3-D terrain generation (structure-from-motion photogrammetry) and bathymetric processing (e.g. bathymetric inversion). The Army requires the data collection to be performed with a hand-launchable SUAS. SUAS-based photogrammetry and bathymetry processing require geo-registration of images from a moving platform. The current state-of-the-art for SUAS image collection and geo-registration is not suitable for near real-time tactical applications. Current registration algorithms degrade over water and cannot reliably quantify performance.  In Phase 1, Prioria will collect SUAS data of coastal environments using high-resolution camera array of COTS cameras and use the data to demonstrate the feasibility of robust geo-registration with error estimate for coastal land, surf zone, and littoral regions. In our proposal, we describe a novel data acquisition concept using the array camera which should mitigate traditional failure modes for registration over water. Finally, in the option, we will perform a preliminary design of an objective payload which will establish SWAP and performance tradeoffs of the passive array and optional LIDAR across the spectrum of hand-launchable SUAS."

        "abstract": "One of the tenets of Army doctrine in Field Manual 100-5 Operations is agility.  A crucial component of agility is the soldiers load.  Today the average US soldier carries at least 60 pounds of gear, with an extended patrol often doubling that weight.  Lightening the load a soldier carries into combat is essential as the challenges during field operations continue to evolve and expand.  Army rations are an integral part of any soldiers gear, and therefore, reduction of the water content and volume of ration components while ensuring nutrient retention has been identified as an important object of research and development lately.  In response, Lynntech proposes to develop and mature a novel, versatile, high-efficiency food concentration technology that promises to produce lower weight and volume rations with increased stability and uncompromised nutritional value and quality.  In the Phase I effort, we will aim to demonstrate the technical feasibility associated with our proposed technology towards reduction in weight of the food.  Target foods will be identified and a detailed assessment of the applicability of the proposed technology towards concentration of different food types will be performed, along with estimation of processing costs and savings from the use of the developed technology."

The AK is conducts highly expeditionary field feeding operations with limited space and may not always have a FSC present.  For the system to be expeditionary it needs to be assembled every time it is used and then repacked and moved.  The AK needs a Compact Sanitation Center (CSC) that is designed specifically for the space constraints and unique requirements of expeditionary field feeding. Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc. (TRI\/Austin) will establish technical feasibility by demonstrating that the CSC for the AK will meet the operational and environmental requirements.  The technical hurdles will be addressed with laboratory environment testing and performance characterization through experimentation.  The supportability, safety, and human factors concerns will be addressed along with estimates of size, weight, cost, safety, and performance.  A prototype will be fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the conceptual design. A production cost and weight estimate will be developed.  The knowledge gained during the development process will ensure that the full-scale performance requirements will be met in Phase II."

Their primary function is to clean cookware and dishes used during preparation of meals throughout the day. The current pack-off volume of the FSC-2 (the legacy FSC system which began deployment in 2006) is excessive and requires a separate vehicle for transportation. There is a critical need for a Compact Sanitation Center (CSC) that can fit within a 25 W x 28 L x 42 H volume while providing the same functionality and increased efficiency compared to the legacy system.    Mainstream proposes a Mobile and Efficient Sanitation System (MESS) as a modular three sink compact sanitation center (CSC) that integrates an automated temperature control system (TCS) capable of providing the Army with an energy-efficient and mobile solution for forward operating bases. The unit is easily packaged within a 25 W x 28 L x 42 H volume, capable of maintaining sink water temperatures of 110, 120, and 171 F with a 60,000 BTU\/hr burner firing rate, and has an estimated large scale production cost of less than $9000 per unit."

        "abstract": "The high cost of polyaramid fibers used in the Flame Retardant Army Combat Uniform (FR-ACU) has driven the development of flame retardant treatments for nylon-cotton (NYCO) blends used in the less expensive Army Combat Uniform (ACU). The most cost effective of these treatments are based on halogenated chemicals, which have been shown to evolve toxic gases when combusted. Though effective on cotton, these halogenated flame retardants are not as effective when used on nylon or nylon blends. Whereas cotton forms a char upon exposure to fire, nylon tends to melt and drip, potentially causing burn damage. Blending the nylon with cotton actually makes the issue worse do to a phenomenon of cotton scaffolding effect. Since cotton is less flammable, its char holds the fiber within the flame and this effect actually increases the combustibility of the nylon. Luna will use our expertise in nano and fluorinated silicates to stabilize the nylon 6,6 resin so that it can form a stable, non-dripping char upon combustion. The incorporation of a high temperature stable nanosilicate, will result in a nylon 6,6 fiber that will not propagate flame or drip, while providing the necessary strength characteristics for a FR-ACU fabric for the Army."

        "abstract": "Warfighter field feeding has many shortcomings including limited variety, inadequate nutrition, and the inability to tailor nutrition to an individual. Soldiers have a wide range of caloric and nutrition requirements based on body type and activity level, and based on environment temperature, humidity and altitude. To address these problems, the Army and other military branches would benefit from utilizing 3D printing technology to create energy dense food items that are available in a variety of taste and texture profiles, and are tailorable to an individuals caloric and nutrition needs.    To address these needs, SMRC proposes the FoodRep on-demand food replication 3D printer. FoodRep is a durable, rugged, three-axis motion platform integrated with a multi-ingredient positive displacement dispense system to produce precisely measured, accurately formed food items with tailorable nutrition, calorie content, taste, and texture. FoodRep food items can be used as a stand-alone soldier feeding solution, or can be used to augment traditional feeding solutions such as MREs. Additionally, FoodRep has great promise to enhance injured soldier care in field hospitals or other medical facilities by being able to accurately control calorie and nutrition intake as well as having the ability to introduce medication and probiotics into the soldiers diet."

These MREs have limited choices; shorter shelf life and theyre not tailored to individuals needs. BeeHex proposes to use a 3D food printer system capable of dispensing variety of macro- and micro-nutrients (in paste, powder and granular forms) to provide food tailored towards individuals preferences and physiological needs. BeeHexs 3D food system will have a simple software interface, computational algorithm to interpret nutritional value based on physical activity and a complete hardware system with 1) 3D Food Printer for paste deposition 2) CNC robot for powder\/granular micronutrient deposition, and 3) IR heating system for quick baking. BeeHex has tested and evaluated variety of technologies to print food of various textures. The system is designed to be USDA compliant with integrated self-cleaning mechanism. We have tested system in a relevant environment for more than 100 hours and our experience will provide a very strong foundation for Armys 3D food printer system."

        "abstract": "To address the U.S. Armys need for a high-bandwidth, compact, wireless, millimeter-wave soldier-borne datalink, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a novel, low-cost Adaptive Millimeter WavE (AMWE) transceiver system capable of enabling data rates of over 2Gbps in a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) multipass environment. This short-range communication system, built on a unique integration of industry-leading millimeter wave (~60GHz) integrated circuits and application-specific adaptive beamforming algorithm dynamically controlling an ultra-wide-band antenna array provides uninterrupted, duplex, low-BER NLOS communication channels free of any mechanically steered or moving components. The innovative AMWE system with built-in software upgradable electrical interface to soldier-borne sensors and devices is a miniature system-in-package (SiP) ruggedized device with integrated micro wafer level chip scale circuits mounted on a ceramic powder-filled and woven microfiberglass-reinforced PTFE composite microwave substrate. In Phase I, POC will develop board-level transceiver prototype resembling\/modeling the WiGig communication link between soldier-borne devices to demonstrate in-hardware feasibility. Simulation results and hardware testing will lead to a final paper design of the link to be developed in Phase II. We anticipate that at the end of Phase II, the SiP AMWE prototype will reach high TRLs and be ready for initial testing at the PEO soldier test facility."

The developed system can either operate on enhanced mode that provides secure and reliable mission-critical communications capabilities, or switch to degraded mode that uses commercial Wi-Fi or LTE network to deliver high-speed voice and data with high throughput rates. Technically, in order to maximize spectral efficiency and support multi-user communications, multi-user superposition transmission is deployed to enable data streams intended for multiple receivers to be transmitted over the same frequency band with differentiated transmission power levels. Noise-modulated covert communication is used to accomplish physical layer security by transmitting an additional masking signal on top of the superposed communication signal so that the eavesdroppers channel capacity can be intentionally degraded. It modulates the superposed signal with a Gaussian noise signal so that transmitted noise-like signal can provide a high degree of confidentiality, and enhance the covertness of data communication. Furthermore, a secure channel hopping scheme is proposed to demonstrate jam-resistance and a hierarchical wireless routing protocol is implemented to reduce route loops and ensure reliable message exchange in battlefield."

We will develop different software components for CHAOS to perform cross-layer spectrum analysis, reconfiguration and routing to form multi-hop networks with time and location dependent spectrum occupancy. We will also implement software modules that enables a CHAOS device to process soldiers BAN sensor data using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and UWB interfaces (as needed to support state-of-the-art BAN sensors). A user-friendly and platform independent application for CHAOS will enable users to configure and program the device.

        "abstract": "The Army has a need for squad-level counter-UAS (C-UAS) systems to protect against the growing threat of UAS attacks. Current C-UAS approaches are typically designed for stationary or vehicle-based systems where size, weight, and power are not of critical importance. In addition, these systems are often very expensive to implement, which will not be a successful future strategy to address the exponentially growing incidence of many small, inexpensive UAS threats. As a result, current systems are unable to provide C-UAS capability at the squad or individual soldier level. In order to address this issue, many C-UAS system manufacturers are developing portable versions of their standard C-UAS devices, which will help to address squad-level C-UAS needs. These layered systems typically address location, tracking, classification, and soft engagement of UAS threats, but there are few, if any, compact solutions that provide hard-kill capability as a last line of defense. A new low-cost, hard-kill solution is needed fill this critical void in the layered C-UAS approach. Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) proposes to develop a low-cost hard-kill device and combine it with an existing layered open-software system approach."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The size, shape, and velocity distribution of fragments are critical for the complete characterization of high-explosive fragmentation process. Such information is needed for the qualification of new energetic materials as well as for warhead design. Current methods to characterize such fragmentation processes are time consuming because they are performed manually. Such methods are limited by their resolution, inability to provide measurements in environments with high luminosity fireballs, and inability to map the trajectories of fragments traveling at high speeds. We propose to develop an ultra-fast volumetric digital imaging technique for mapping the shape, size, and velocity of explosively driven fragments. The proposed turnkey system will allow dynamic 2D and 3D mapping of fragment trajectories, and provide center of mass and velocity of the fragments in various graphical and tabular formats in near real-time.; BENEFIT: The proposed technology will address the often incredibly demanding requirements for imaging otherwise concealed, near-instantaneous and\/or transient events and structures, where optical imaging or other means of information capture or gathering are impossible, inadequate or insufficient individually. Specifically, the proposed technologies are ideal for imaging and discerning the behavior of objects moving at high-speed, such as the positions and activities of pistons, valves and\/or other metallic, ceramic and\/or composite components in engines during fuel injection and combustion, air bag deployment testing and determining the effects of impacts on auto body components, and testing protective gear such as helmets for construction, motorcycle\/bicycle and sports activities. It will also find widespread use in medical, industrial, and homeland security applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The current procedures for ground based arena tests are time consuming and costly, while only producing a fraction of the desired data. In the current method, the device under test is surrounded by switch screens to record fragment impact time and bundles of foam insulation to capture fragments. Fragments must be recovered by hand to be weighed and measured, requiring weeks of labor. This process is time consuming and gives no way to correlate fragment mass and velocity. Additionally, only a fraction of the fragments are recovered. To meet the need for an automatic method of full hemisphere warhead fragmentation characterization, McQ has developed the Fragment Size Analysis and Tracking (FSAT) system which replaces the ring of switch screens with a network of sensors containing high speed cameras. FSAT will record and analyze video of the warhead fragmentation then automatically produce a report describing the mass, size, speed, and trajectory of each fragment. In Phase I, McQ will enhance the FSAT system by focusing on improvements which will make the system easier to use as well as improve the accuracy and consistency of capturing statistics for a wider range of size\/speed fragments.; BENEFIT: The proposed work will provide the Air Force with the critical capability of quickly and accurately performing warhead fragmentation characterization in arena tests. This will offer significant benefit over the current methods which are costly, labor intensive, and incomplete. Due to the incomplete data produced by the current method, past characterizations have been conservative to ensure a minimum guaranteed effectiveness. To match the current need for munitions with minimal collateral damage, higher fidelity fragmentation data is needed. The proposed McQ FSAT system will provide the capability to capture this critical data. The FSAT system will provide complete hemispherical characterization of mass, size, speed, and trajectory for each fragment in an automatically generated report. Additionally, the fragment data will be available for import into existing fragmentation modeling software. The proposed system will be scalable to match the needs of numerous military and commercial high velocity projectile tracking applications. The modular design will allow immediate use for arena testing, yet the flexibility to provide enhanced performance in the future as COTS high speed cameras and other front end components are developed to provide additional capabilities of interest."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Modular EP Diagnostic Instrumentation Cluster (MEDIC) is a self-contained plasma diagnostic instrument suite uniquely suited to the task of characterizing and comparing thruster operation in ground test and on-orbit environments. Of paramount importance to the qualification of electric propulsion (EP) systems is the measurable influence of the ground testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) facility background pressure and walls on the behavior and performance of electric thrusters. The complexity of these facility effects has prevented predictive models from extrapolating the measured performance of an electric thruster to in-space conditions. The discord between flight, ground T&amp;E, and predictive modeling capabilities requires a novel state-of-health (SOH) diagnostic system that can monitor thruster behavior both in space and in different vacuum test chambers  providing a direct comparison between the different environments. MEDIC accomplishes this task through the combination of advanced EP plasma diagnostics, such as high-speed (100 kHz) Langmuir probes, ion energy analyzers, and UV emission spectroscopy, with remote measurement capabilities - all within a self-contained 1U CubeSat unit. At the end of this program a fully operational MEDIC system will have been developed and characterized, and the measurement capabilities of MEDIC demonstrated on an operating xenon Hall thruster at multiple US facilities.; BENEFIT: A protoflight MEDIC system will be demonstrated and delivered to the Air Force with fast (up to 100 kHz) measurement capabilities, low power (15 year lifetime), and unprecedented versatility. This novel diagnostic will be capable of operating advanced plasma diagnostics in terrestrial T&amp;E facilities and on-obit, thus giving the EP industry a critical tool to correlate in-flight and ground test data in support of thruster qualification. The in-situ measurements enabled by MEDIC may lead to much longer lived thrusters, accurate prediction of on-orbit capabilities, higher efficiency thruster systems, and on-orbit real-time monitoring of thruster behavior. In addition to providing a valuable tool for the EP industry, the low-cost, modular design of MEDIC gives it the flexibility to operate with a diverse array of plasma diagnostics that would be of interest to in-space scientific endeavors, such as characterization of Earths magnetosphere, the Heliosphere, and different planetary atmospheres."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Busek proposed to develop an instrument package for high fidelity measurements and long-term state-of-health monitoring of plasma properties from solar electric propulsion (SEP) plasma sources in test chambers and the space environment.  The proposed system will include a Faraday probe, a Langmuir probe, and an ion energy analyzer.  The instrument suite will be capable of periodic, time-averaged measurements as well as time-resolved capabilities to periodically evaluate plasma oscillations up to ~100 kHz.    The probes together with the electronics that control them constitute a High Speed Plasma Probe and Electronics Suite (HSPPES).  The probes used for ground testing would initially be discrete units that may be translated within the plasma plume to collect data throughout the thruster plume that is required to validate and calibrate thruster plasma and plume models.  For ground testing, the Electronics Module (EM) will initially be rack mounted and constructed from commercial parts.  For in-space applications, the EM will be repackaged as a cube targeting a 10 x 10 x 10 cm form.  The probes themselves could be mounted within the cube.  Individual boards and probes may be removed or added as required for different missions.; BENEFIT: The proposed system will be used to characterize plasma thruster plumes on the ground during the test and evaluation phase of development, and in-space during thruster operations.  Data taken in space may be correlated with ground measurements taken with the same probes, and with predictions made by plasma simulations.  This will validate spacecraft-plume simulations, enabling their use for risk reduction associated with future missions. In-space probes may also be used for state-of-health monitoring over missions which may last 15 years or longer.  The proposed system may fly on an Air Force or National Security missions, also carrying a Hall effect thruster.  The system would also be used in Electric Propulsion laboratories throughout the United Stated for test and evaluation.    Potential applications for Hall thrusters include station-keeping, orbit raising, inclination changes, and de-orbiting."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Two separate diagnostic techniques are proposed for measuring concentrations of neutral xenon in Hall thruster research: radar REMPI and a variant of laser-induced fluorescence. Both methods have the potential to provide nonintrusive measurements at millimeter-level spatial resolution and microsecond-level time resolution, and both have already been demonstrated at xenon molecule concentrations of around 10^18 per cubic meter in non-optimized setups. In the proposed study, optimization of both techniques will be explored to determine the feasibility of detecting lower concentrations, with a target of 10^13 per cubic meter, which is needed for obtaining a better understanding of Hall thruster processes. The two methods will be compared and contrasted, and a recommendation will be made on which is most likely to enable the desired diagnostic.; BENEFIT: A diagnostic capable of measuring neutral xenon concentrations in plasmas will help elucidate fundamental plasma physics in practical test facilities. This improved understanding should lead to improvements in several plasma based technologies, such as longer lasting more efficient satellite thrusters. Modeling of plasma dynamics in Hall thrusters is currently limited by the lack of available data needed for validation. The diagnostic would help provide data that enables better models, leading to cost savings in future satellite propulsion systems. Other plasma technologies that could see cost benefits include water decontamination and purification, plasma processing, and plasma micro\/nano-fabrication."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: An innovative diagnostic, Time-Resolved Electron Beam Fluorescence (TREBF), will be developed that possesses the measurement capabilities needed to understand test facility effects on electric propulsion (EP) systems. Even the most advanced test and evaluation vacuum chambers are incapable of replicating the pressures encountered in geostationary earth orbits. These elevated background pressures influence thruster stability, performance, lifetime, and plume behavior. The fundamental processes driving these effects are at present unknown, obfuscating predictive models and precluding standardized test conditions or physics-based performance corrections. A deeper understanding of neutral dynamics in non-equilibrium, partially-ionized EP plasma flows is required to address the facility effects problem; however, state-of-the-art neutral diagnostics do not possess the requisite spatial and temporal resolution. TREBF overcomes these limitations by exciting plasma neutral particles with an incident electron beam and measuring the resulting fluorescence. Using commercially available materials and sensors, TREBF is able to measure neutral particle densities down to 1017 particles\/m3 at temporal and spatial resolutions on the order of 1 s and 1 mm, respectively. At the end of this program a fully functional TREBF system will have been developed and characterized, and its measurement capabilities will have been demonstrated on an operating Hall thruster at multiple US facilities.; BENEFIT: The Time-Resolved Electron Beam Fluorescence (TREBF) system proposed here is a portable, cost-effective diagnostic that is uniquely capable of probing neutral gas dynamics on length (~1 mm) and time (~1 s) scales relevant to electric propulsion (EP) plasmas, making it a crucial tool for the testing and evaluation of electric propulsion systems. Compared to laser-based diagnostics, TREBF possesses improved versatility because the electron-induced fluorescence manifests from the collisional excitation of plasma ions and neutrals. As a result TREBF is able to examine the ion, neutral, and molecular species of various propellants and erosion byproducts by simply observing the appropriate emission line. The ability to monitor these systems may lead to much longer lived thrusters, accurate prediction of on-orbit capabilities, higher efficiency thruster systems, and on-orbit real-time monitoring of thruster behavior. Beyond this, the ability to characterize thruster behavior at relatively high back pressures allows the testing of advanced propellants and higher power thruster systems that cannot be tested in conventional facilities. In addition to being a valuable tool for the EP industry, TREBF has potentially valuable commercial applications in the fields of plasma processing and waste treatment."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: After a certain amount of service time, many aircraft components need to be cleaned and the coatings on those parts need to be stripped. Prior to the chemical cleaning and stripping processes, those parts are routinely examined by inspectors to locate the part numbers and find their matches on a list. Such a visual inspection process is not only time consuming, but also prone to human errors. Additionally, visual inspection is often plagued by the fact that the part numbers may not be visible as the fielded parts are typically covered by coatings, oxides, and surface contaminations. When the incorrectly assigned alloys are subjected to the caustic chemicals during the stripping processes, it could lead to collateral damages, which may render the parts useless.  In this proposal, AlphaSense details the development of a novel, low cost and handheld sensor for metal identification in fielded aerospace parts. If successful, the merits of the proposed sensor and its advantages over existing techniques include the following: a) Compact, handheld and low cost, b) Sensitive for metal alloy identification, c) Capable of interrogating parts without the need for surface preparations, d) High throughput measurement process, and f)Easy and safe to the operators.; BENEFIT: The outcome of this research is coupled to a very clear commercialization path. The proposed sensor can be used for many military and civilian applications. The most straightforward military application of the proposed sensor is to be used in various Air Force and DoD maintenance and repair facilities to quickly and accurately identify different metal alloys prior to the chemical stripping\/cleaning processes. The deployment of the proposed sensor can replace existing visual inspection process to dramatically reduce the inspection time and enhance the identification accuracy. Therefore, not only can it lead to significant time and cost savings in the metal alloy identification process, but also minimize\/eliminate the collateral damages in subsequent chemical cleaning\/stripping process due to incorrectly assigned alloys. Consequently, the parts can be repaired in a timely manner to enhance the mission readiness of various aircrafts and ground vehicles. In addition to metal alloy identification, the proposed sensor may also be used by DoD to detect sensitization in both aerospace and marine aluminum alloys, which is a precursor for intergranular corrosion and stress corrosion cracking. For civilian applications, the proposed sensor can be used by commercial aerospace and aviation OEMs to identify, sort and recycle metal alloys. Additionally, the sensor may be used to detect defects present in a wide variety of materials and platforms. Consequently, defects including corrosion, material degradation, aging and sensitization present in polymer, metal, composite and ceramic material system can be potentially detected with the proposed sensor technology."

The goal is to develop a hand-held alloy identification method that can be performed within a few seconds and one that requires only a few minutes of setup time.   The JENTEK MWM and MWM-Array sensing technology can reliably measure the electrical conductivity of alloys, as well as characterize coatings, typically used in aircraft structures and engines. Both directional conductivity measurements and multiple frequency methods will be used to enhance discrimination, as appropriate. JENTEKs new hand-held product will be updated in this SBIR to deliver reliable alloy identification. This SBIR will also investigate complimentary sensing methods and available component information that can improve alloy discrimination confidence when combined with the MWM data.; BENEFIT: JENTEKs new 7-channel hand-held instrumentation is an extension of its 8200-series instrumentation which provides increased data acquisition rates, reduced noise and thermal drift as well as simultaneous data acquisition at multiple frequencies. This easily portable, low-cost system developed under this SBIR will provide value for rapid alloy identification, in a wide range of commercial markets from automotive to commercial aerospace. Together with the MWM-Array technology, the method can provide high confidence alloy identification through dirt, paint and coatings, including metallic coatings typically used in aircraft engine components.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Support for legacy aircraft systems is critical to the warfighter.  The Air Forces sustainment responsibilities encompass thousands of airframes and engines, representing some systems that have been out of production since the 1960s and 1970s.  Among the most critical out-of-production components are those made from aluminum, steel, and magnesium castings.  These castings are essential to gearboxes and housings, which are in turn essential to virtually every aircraft in the Air Force inventory.  Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex has reported that a single gearbox housing has a lead time of 24 months and a cost of $80,000. A game changing solutionleveraging leading-edge  additive manufacturing capability that provides step-function improvement in schedule and costis proposed to address the need for these steel, aluminum, and magnesium castings.  Accomplishment of this solution is made possible through the combination of reverse engineering capability, additive manufacturing, and accompanying technologies that will form ceramic tooling\/process aids to produce investment castings in a fraction of the time, with dramatically reduced cost relative to conventional methods.   Renaissance Services, in conjunction with its partners Aristo Cast and BASF, will leverage their combined experience to provide a system for Rapid Engineered Casting Replacement with Additive &amp; Formative Technologies (RE-CRAFT).; BENEFIT: The proposed system will reduce the lead time for critical ceramic process aids (cores and molds) for investment castings by a minimum of 95% by eliminating the need for hard tooling and replacing it with CAD data that will be input directly for 3D printing of necessary cores and molds.  As such, a process that typically requires 180 days will be reduced to 7 days.  In addition to the lead time reduction, the elimination of this hard tooling will save between $100,000 and $750,000 in non recurring costs for each casting part number.  While these lead time and cost savings are significant, the greatest benefit will be increased responsiveness to the needs of the warfighter, as critical steel, aluminum, and magnesium castings for gearboxes and actuator housings are made available in a fraction of the time and cost when compared to current processes."

However, there are still many problems and limitations to the technology for cost effective high resolution, high throughput manufacturing.  The beam alone is currently 2X larger than the program requirements for AF161-010 with a second barrier of throughput for larger, high resolution parts. Throughput is the gating factor for large part Direct Metal Laser Sinter (DMLS) which is compounded by smaller beam size for high resolution printing.      Digibeam is presenting an innovative solution using a different beam and growth process that directly addresses both resolution and throughput limitations to meet and exceed USAF SBIR AF161-010 requirements.  3D Printing will be performed in a single tool using a process called Direct Metal Adsorption Printing (DMAP).  DMAP uses a novel high speed pulsed ion beam to print 2D patterns from CAD and then non-thermally growing multi-layer materials from the printed patterns at room temperature in separate chambers.  The repetitive 2D print and growth allows 3D additive manufacturing of high resolution precision structures.; BENEFIT: High resolution, precision castings manufactured by a new self assembled, low cost additive manufacturing technology."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Advratech will work with the University of Dayton Research Institute and Lockheed Martin Corp. to develop a novel reverse engineering process for the Air Force sustainment Center.  The key technologies include 3D scanners (with 30 um accuracy), additive manufacturing (AM) software with automatic support structure development, a selective laser melting (SLM) testbed, a subtractive micromachining laser, and a laser-line profilometer.  By integrating these technologies into a single process we will be able to reverse engineer parts with only a single software handoff, demonstrate in situ dimensional validation of the part, as well as post-build dimensional validation.  3D scanning and build preparation take only a few hours combined, so every part will be reverse engineered and built within 5 days.  The most novel aspect of this project is modifying our SLM testbed by adding a subtractive micromachining laser to perform in-process micromachining.  This will allow us to build components with more accurate dimensional accuracy, and importantly, with smooth surface finish that is required of many Air Force components.  Therefore, we can adjust this build process to meet the end-use requirements of any single part.; BENEFIT: The project will create a new process that will facilitate rapid reverse engineering of components of interest to the Air Force sustainment center (AFSC).  Benefits include:      1) Easy 3D scanning of components with no available CAD file.     2) Reverse engineering and correction of damaged and worn out parts.     3) In-process dimensional validation of areas embedded in the part that cannot be scanned post-build     4) Post-build dimensional validation to ensure the part meets geometric requirements.     5) Parts can be built with smooth surface finish, rough surface finish, or somewhere in between to meet end-use requirements.       6) Short turnaround time will enhance AFSC efficiency.    Future research on this process could also enable a unique form of closed-loop feedback control, thus improving process reliability and further enhancing AFSC capability.  Potential commercial applications of this process are vast, as they are for any additive manufacturing advancement.  Initial customers of interest will include aerospace prime contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMCO), Boeing, or Pratt &amp; Whitney.  LMCO sees potential benefits to several of their current Air Force programs, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, B-2,C-130, and several others.  In fact, because of their strong interest in commercializing this technology they have joined the project team as a subcontractor.  Advratech also currently has strong relationship with NASA, where this technology could also be useful for reverse engineering and producing components for NASA platforms.  We also envision interest from industries outside of aerospace, such as the automotive industry."

        "abstract": "To address the Air Force need to detect the earliest stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in an aircrafts life cycle, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Corrosion Stress Assessment (COSTA) method and system. It is based on innovative combination of in-situ thermal strain monitoring, allowing detection of strength anomalies, and measurement of hydrogen concentration level, which accompanies earliest SCC formation. The COSTA will also enable detection of existing cracks, and evaluate crack growth rate in situ and in real time. The standalone COSTA system operates on both painted and unpainted structures and needs a few minutes to inspect a 1x1 ft area. The lightweight and compact system can be used for condition-based maintenance on military aircraft, which directly addresses the Air Force requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the COSTA method and system through modeling, simulation, design, development, risk evaluation, and testing of a bench-top prototype reaching technology readiness level (TRL)-3. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a full-scale system prototype that enables automatic detection and analysis of the earliest SCC formation and existing SCC found on validated and verified stress corrosion specimens, reaching TRL-5."

        "abstract": "Reliable diagnosis of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in aircraft components at an early stage is critical for maintaining mission readiness and safety. One of the primary challenges associated with maintenance management for aircraft components is that SCC does not grow at a steady rate over the life of the component, but rather the majority of the remaining useful life is spent before macroscale SCC initiates. Many traditional inspection technologies failed to effectively detect microscopic SCC in aircraft components. FBS proposes a novel nonlinear ultrasonic guided wave inspection approach and device for detecting microscopic SCC at an extremely early stage along with guided wave imaging capability of accurately identifying and characterizing macroscale SCC. Nonlinear guided waves are sensitive to microstructure change of the material and can be utilized to evaluate material properties even before the initiation of macroscale SCC. Linear guided wave scan can be used to generate damage imaging of SCC at a later stage. Another benefit of guided wave inspection is that it is able to perform long-distance inspection of hidden or inaccessible regions of the aircraft, and the sensors can be completely contained within the airframe."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: TRI\/Austin will develop a method for generating 3D digital models of aircraft components and structures by piggybacking on data from commonly used in-service depot inspections.  Modern cost saving programs, such as Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) and High Velocity Maintenance (HVM), developed and implemented throughout the Air Force, rely on digital data flows and analyses.  Unfortunately, older mission critical aircraft, such as the B-52 and C-130, were designed before the advent of the digital era.  TRI\/Austin proposes to use its NDI modeling and experimental expertise to develop techniques, algorithms, and software to generate digital 3D models of aircraft parts using data from one-sided inspection techniques.  Unlike current methods for reverse engineering aircraft parts to generate 3D models, which require their removal from the aircraft, these one-sided inspections techniques do not and can be performed in tandem or in parallel with existing inspections performed in the depot environment.  Data from multiple inspections and multiple inspection techniques will be correlated to refine the digital models.  Software with a simple interface will display all correlated data and 3D model renderings.  The generated surface mesh will be output in common file formats so that they may be used with other existing software packages.; BENEFIT: Having a digital twin for components and structures is needed in manufacturing, as well as at repair facilities, to preserve the digital thread.  The total market associated with solely imaging unknown structures is probably on the order of &lt; 10 systems, based on the number of facilities where the repair of aging aircraft is expected to occur.  Being able to apply this technique to new production is key to developing a commercially viable product.    It is envisioned that this method for 3D part modeling using NDI data would be integrated into TRI\/Austins NDEToolbox software system, and could easily be deployed to support the management of weapon systems by the specific Program Offices.  The NDEToolbox has potential customers outside of defense which utilize nondestructive inspections.  These include oil and gas, automotive, structural maintenance, etc.    The F-35, the KC-46, and the next generation bomber are the largest programs underway at the Air Force for new aircraft.  Each of these program offices are a potential customer for the outcomes of this program, as new designs drive down structural factors of safety and increase the need for accurate digital twins.  These are just a couple of TRI\/Austins long term opportunities to provide the product developed for this solicitation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The majority of the current USAF fleet of aircraft was developed prior to widespread 3D modeling software thus all subsequent developed technical data is flat 2D. Developing these models for the aging fleet will allow these benefits to be obtained.  Developing 3D models for the USAF aging fleet will be achieved in a multipronged approach including leveraging current models, direct scanning, manual modeling, and scalable vector graphics then outputting the models in the required formats as needed.  Once developed, these 3D models can be leveraged in a visualization system capable of tying models with technical data directly interacting with approved systems including 202, 107, and ETIMS.  Eliminating unnecessary labor to describe and detail a 3D task with 2D data along with the current manual effort to document its results will reduce time and save money.  During Phase I, ES3 will develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a system that will develop 3D models and output them in the required format for the identified uses.  ES3 will also demonstrate the feasibility of visualization for developed 3D models tied with approved data sources to improve a USAF selected maintenance task such as NDI on the wing of the KC-135.; BENEFIT: ES3 anticipates the results of the Phase I work will validate the feasibility and need for immediate pursuit of Phase II efforts.   After successful development and implementation of the 3D Model Generation and Task Visualization Software System:    Decreased flow days for PDM of selected aircraft(decreased cost)   Improved PDM productivity through task visualization and improved process control through decreased dependency on tribal knowledge (increased quality)   Increased throughput capability of the repair depot due to decreased time to detail task and record and share test\/maintenance results(increased surge capacity)"

The temperature detection instrumentation proposed is a combination of a moderate cost long wave thermography camera, together with a shortwave infrared interferometer applied through a process known as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). In each case, the optical instrument will be coupled with physical optics (including lenses) that allow focus and enlargement of the laser heat affected zone. Software will curve-fit the temperature field of each layer, and its change over time, comparing this to analytical predictions for a CAD-modelled component being manufactured. Deviation statistics will be calculated, and compared to deviation amount and characteristics that signify insufficient bonding integrity or other defects (e.g. improper constituency of a particular grain of material). Components that are faulty will be rejected before additional production time is wasted. More importantly, the proposed system will allow the AM manufacturing facility to determine the point in the process where the problem has occurred, allowing on-going process improvement.; BENEFIT: The proposed innovation is expected to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in additive manufacturing inspection systems, while creating the standard for in-process inspection and quantification of structural integrity associated error in aerospace critical components.  The anticipated direct benefit of this project is to transform and further develop military depot prototyping, sustainment and production centers.  OBIES will provide direct position-related anomaly detection coupled with structural integrity quantification via the OCT technology employed.  By defining acceptable error in the production process of aerospace critical components, the foreseen benefit would be to maximize production efforts while minimizing wasted time and material.  Furthermore, many other U.S. government agencies would greatly benefit from the industrial production advances that MSIs process would present. Commercial application directly parallels with the proposed innovations advancement of additive manufacturing processes.  Virtually any commercial production process either currently using additive manufacturing or that would benefit by employing additive manufacturing technology would capitalize on reduced production costs and times."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Additive manufacturing (AM) is a very promising technique for rapid, low-cost production of aerospace-related parts directly from a CAD file. AM is especially appealing for complex parts that would be costly or impossible to fabricate by machining or casting. It is also attractive for repairs to existing parts and fabrication of prototype parts.  At present there are no reliable, cost-effective process control techniques to minimize defect production and for qualification of finished parts. Studies at several government agencies have noted this gap and urged increased efforts to develop techniques for part qualification. In this project we will demonstrate the feasibility of applying laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) to inspect each deposited layer in real time as it is formed. This in-line inspection qualifies the part layer-by-layer, ensuring finished parts that require no further testing. We will work with Air Force personnel to select or prepare simulated aerospace critical parts for testing. We will then optimize the beam configuration for the best defect sensitivity, and also develop signal processing algorithms to enhance defect detection. We will then test the selected samples and demonstrate the detection of critical defects. In Phase II a prototype in-line inspection system will be developed and tested.; BENEFIT: Additive manufacturing is finding broad applications for the fabrication of high-value, safety-critical components. AM of components for rocket engines and spacecraft thrusters is particularly advanced. NASA is pursuing AM of critical engine components for future heavy-lift space launch systems. Aerojet Rocketdyne is developing a liquid-oxygen\/gaseous hydrogen rocket injector assembly built by additive manufacturing. The SuperDraco engines for the SpaceX Dragon V2 manned spacecraft have 3D-printed combustion chambers that enable the engines to produce 100 times the thrust than the Draco engines in current unmanned versions of the Dragon. Aircraft engine suppliers have been investing heavily in capacity for AM parts manufacturing. Key high-value components such as injection nozzles are found multiple times in a turbine engine. The use of AM will reduce engine weight and cost. Components designed with complex cooling channels that were expensive or even impossible to make can now be produced by AM. The introduction of in-line, real-time laser ultrasonic testing to characterize 3D-printed parts supports Executive Order 13329, &quot;Encouraging Innovation in Manufacturing.&quot;"

        "abstract": "To address the Air Force need for remote detection of low-level Earth surface vibrations via detection of diffusely modulated light, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Vibration Detection and Material Identification (VDMI) sensor. It is based on a new design that measures the relative modulation of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of light scattered by the Earths surface and objects and provides simultaneous scene imagery from hundreds of kilometers. Specifically, the innovation in sensor design will enable the VDMI sensor to measure vibrations and spectral signatures of inspected surfaces from space and airborne platforms. As a result, this sensor offers microradian vibration sensitivity at bandwidths over tens of kilohertz, and reliable material identification based on collection and analysis of photometric data in Space object identification In Living Color (SILC) wavelengths, which directly address the Space Vehicles Directorate requirements for instrumentation for passive sensing of diffusely modulated signatures. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the VDMI sensor with a scalable sensor prototype reaching TRL-3. In Phase II, POC will develop a sensor applicable for airborne platforms and verify its performance under different environmental conditions and in varied locations, reaching TRL-6."

        "abstract": "In order to reduce the costs and schedule required for ground system deployments, a Common Simulation Environment (CSE) can be used that allows both the factory bus\/payload integration and operational TT&amp;C systems to integrate quickly and effectively. With the advent of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) and the Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) Bus there is the opportunity to provide a CSE by adding plug-in code to existing frameworks to mimic all the scarce and difficult-to-integrate components within EGS.  The functionality provided by Ground Resource Manager (GRM) through the Service Interface Specification Document for the MMSOC would enable encapsulation of all the EGS functionality into a simple and easy to use\/deploy Software Simulation.   With CSE in place, it could then be supplied for use to both the factory and TT&amp;C developers, allowing a common test framework that significantly reduces risk on the path to operations.  A common command and telemetry definition can also be developed that allows the CSE capability to be used with different vehicles and programs.  Finally, with a common ground interface and command and telemetry definitions in place, the amount of reuse that can be expected for a given TT&amp;C system is greatly enhanced."

The end result will make satellite ground system development and integration easier and reusable across satellite programs, while also speeding the satellite development process, and reducing the end-to-end program technical risk.  We call this system Bench-to-Orbit, or B2O.  The objective of this Phase 1 SBIR is to develop a ground architecture that promotes ground system reuse between Integration &amp; Test (I&amp;T) and Operations, and from program to program.  The proposed ground architecture incorporates key lessons learned in the development and deployment of both Common System Integration Laboratory (CSIL) and quantumCMD.  It also highlights how the architecture is modular and supports new functionality via commercially supported open standards.  From a Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) compatibility perspective, the architecture developed will promote end-to-end interoperability with the overall USAF Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) architecture.   Finally, the architecture will utilize cross task touchpoints and data products identified during Phase 1 to streamline processes and functions within the system."

Detection and characterization processes both for real-time and after-the-fact analysis will maintain themselves based upon user goals and thus will not require substantial expert interaction to create and maintain rule sets. The resulting new Enterprise Ground Satellite Command and Control (E-GSCC) system will learn normal behaviors in real satellite telemetry off-line and then in real-time provide historical pattern matching and unknown abnormal pattern discovery across missions and threat locations. The E-GSCC detection and reporting processes will decide when to retrain, what data to retrain on, what to test on, and when to promote to on-line operations. Operators will monitor processes, set thresholds in real time for detection and reporting of events with supporting correlations to historical events, likely attribution, and response recommendations. We have experience in delivering these types of capabilities at TRL7 which reduces risk. We will leverage these capabilities to index, export, and search large volumes of archived data, across streams of telemetry and mission data from multiple satellites to demonstrate high performance searching for valid disparate balanced training set selection, off-line data-pattern learning, and on-line abnormal measurand correlation detection, event cause characterization, and response recommendations."

We will research and analyze the human factors affecting operator function and performance across multiple satellite systems, and the common and unique aspects of space systems currently in use. We will develop logical constructs for the visualization of health and status information; anomalous condition alerts; resource scheduling; and a process for command identification, selection, and distribution within the EGS construct. We will develop configuration rule-sets to control the UDOP visual layout, and operator roles to enable multi-satellite monitoring from a single console, while preventing dual commanding of the same satellite from multiple consoles. The limited scope of the Phase I effort will be constrained to the development of representative use cases to support user screen navigation methodologies, configuration controls, and permissions. Use cases will be chosen based on initial data collection and analysis to best represent normal and anomalous operations. The final Phase I product will consist of a proof-of-concept demonstration of the user interface, a draft design interface specification to guide further UDOP development, and preliminary measurement and analysis metrics."

        "abstract": "The United States relies heavily on force multiplying, space-based navigation, communications, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) satellites.  Military space programs have begun a paradigm shift, from small constellations of large spacecraft, to large constellations of small spacecraft.  These large constellations will require complex support requirements for the ground station network and satellite operations resources.  Until recently, most satellite programs were controlled via contractor proprietary, unique ground control systems having one-of-a-kind user interface systems.  Telemetry and command displays were different for each spacecraft system, requiring time-consuming and expensive training for space operations crews, and ineffective tabular data displays.  Spacecraft designed three decades ago typically had several hundred telemetry points, all with unique names (mnemonics) that had to be learned by crew personnel.  Modern spacecraft designs, incorporating new technologies, can easily have several thousand telemetry points.  This incredible increase in information available to crew members presents significant challenges for crew training, and effective use of this data by space operations crew members.  Tau Technologies has conceived a new telemetry and command user interface system that exploits commonalities in spacecraft design,  new information systems technologies and in-house space operations and software engineering expertise  to provide an intuitive,  user-definable satellite telemetry display system."

In addition to detecting rapid spikes or gradual drifts in telemetry data, Durgas methods can discover periodic and seasonal patterns, as well as connections between data features that can assist operators in diagnosing and handling complex non-deterministic scenarios. These analytics, collectively called the Cognitive Engine, are powered by new advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and they form the core of a complete system architecture that also defines methods for data acquisition and storage according to a uniform data model, and standards for data visualization and user interaction. The architecture enables the system to scale in data volume and velocity from an initial prototype in a single Space Operations Center to a global system-of-systems deployment, and it provides a pathway for incremental growth in complexity by adding new features into the data space and by adding new algorithms to the Cognitive Engine. The full Durga architecture also contains a powerful condition-action Rules Engine that enables expert users to create deterministic responses to specific events."

However, significant work is still required to transition NASA&apos;s existing  automated mission planning software to Air Force satellite operations.  The Air  Force is moving to standardize its satellite ground control systems based on  the emerging Enterprise Ground System (EGS) architecture. While the EGS  architecture diagram includes roles for mission planning, mission execution,  and mission monitoring, the standard components to fill those roles have not  yet been selected. Here, we propose to clarify the Air Force&apos;s needs for these  automated components and to evaluate the ability of existing high-TRL NASA  technology to fill those needs.  In particular, we will evaluate  JPL&apos;s TRL-9 CASPER\/ASPEN planning and scheduling system, building on our prior  experience with the HAMMER onboard satellite autonomous control system.  The resulting MC-HAMMER proof of concept will show how automated ground-based mission planning  can improve satellite efficiency, reduce human workload, and increase responsiveness and optempo."

        "abstract": "Alphacore proposes to design and implement the desired Analog to Information Processor (AIP) converter capable of directly converting RF (radio frequency) signals to information. Analog to feature\/direct-information converters has been widely researched across various methods of implementation (including use of optics, magnetic field storage and so on). The hardware implementation of such systems has not yet been evaluated for RF (radio frequency) bandwidths due to the impact of circuit impairment on performance limitations. Although the AIP architectures facilitates slower ADCs, the signal encoding, typically performed by a mixer-like circuit, still occurs at the Nyquist frequency of the input to avoid aliasing. The jitter and aperture of this mixing stage limits the achievable AIF resolution. Alphacores solution to this problem is our innovative high input bandwidth and high linearity (&gt;12 bits) non-uniform input sampler and filter which has a very low jitter at these Nyquist frequencies. Since the architecture do not require an ADC with sampling rate higher than 200Megasample per second (MS\/s), the power savings will be significant, potentially more than 90%.  The computational load for the DSP will also be reduced to a fraction as compared to existing solutions."

        "abstract": "Electric orbit-raising offers significant advantages to GEO spacecraft users and operators.  Electric propulsion decreases the required spacecraft fuel mass by as much as 90%, and enables the elimination of large tanks, thrusters, valves, and other propulsion subsystem components when a conventional hydrazine or bi-propellant system is not required.  These optimizations can reduce the launch mass of a spacecraft by as much as 50%.    However, the fuel efficiency of electric thrusters comes at a cost.  Their maximum thrust is a tiny fraction of a conventional orbit raising thruster, requiring five to ten times as many days to arrive on-station.  This extends the orbit raising period from several weeks to over half a year.   This issue of requiring additional time to arrive on station can be mitigated by increasing the power available for electric propulsion during the orbit-raising period.  If a spacecraft was able to deliver additional solar array power during this orbit raising period to the orbit-raising thruster, it could shorten this period by as much as 40%.  That improvement would enable in-service operation months ahead of time.  Cubic Aerospaces HPPT design enables the utilization of additional BOL solar power for electric propulsion, reducing the transfer orbit time required."

        "abstract": "The project focuses on the development of a low cost, compact, low tank pressure, high performance nanosat propulsion system which could be scaled to larger spacecraft. The technology, based on micropumps developed for hydrazine, MMH, NTO, AF-M315E and LMP-103S, has been demonstrated in hot-fire tests with hydrazine, and hot fire tests are planned for a 100 lbf class MMH\/MON-25 thruster. The proposed effort leverages developments made as part of several on-going programs and integrates them into a high performance system. The Phase I effort also includes hardware manufacturing and test to reduce development risks. With a micropump, the pressurization system is eliminated, the propellant storage and feed system can be designed for low pressures, and lighter, conformal tanks can be used for greater compactness. This reduces system overall size and mass thus providing increases in performance. Hardware costs are significantly less (fewer components). Furthermore, many of the components can be made affordably and quickly using additive manufacturing techniques.  The technology can be used for steady-state burns, in pulse-mode, and for throttling if needed for optimum mission operations, and is applicable to all propellant combinations and scales ranging from CubeSats and Nanosats to larger satellites such as GPS and AEHF."

        "abstract": "Spacecraft frequently use pressurized helium for propellant tank pressurization, which while safe and effective carries a weight penalty that becomes burdensome as tank size increases. In this project, Ultramet will investigate pressurization systems wherein the pressurant will come from either the thermal decomposition of a solid or from the decomposition of existing liquid propellant on the spacecraft. Both approaches eliminate the need for a helium reservoir. In one approach, a solid will fill the pores of an electrically heated monolith of ceramic foam, and gas will be generated on demand by passing electricity through the foam to thermally decompose the solid. An endothermic solid will be used so the system cannot undergo thermal runaway. In the other approach, small volumes of propellant will be fed into a small reaction vessel filled with electrically heated foam. In both approaches, the resulting gases will be fed into the pressurant side of the propellant tank to provide pressurization. Such systems will reduce the mass relative to a helium-based system. Because the hardware mass for this concept is independent of propellant throughput, the benefits become more pronounced with larger spacecraft. This approach also enables tank pressure to be regulated for reduced impulse variability."

        "abstract": "Despite much progress obtained in the pioneering MIPE research well documented in the literature of the 1960s, the available switching technology of the day was slow, heavy, expensive, and unreliable at high voltage and current. Switches needed to be switched at hundreds of kilohertz to achieve high exit velocity and high Isp. With modern Si, SiC, and GaN high voltage IGBTs or switching MOSFETs, many MW of power can now be switched reliably with losses of a percent or less. In this proposal, DTI proposes to leverage decades of expertise in state-of-the-art high power switching to study, design, and build a modernized version of the MIPE thruster. This lightweight, electrodeless thruster will exhibit high thrust and high specific impulse capabilities, with the added benefit of minimizing plasma-wall interactions through careful control of geometries and magnetic circuit design."

        "abstract": "Electrospray thrusters are superior to plasma based electric propulsion with respect to thrust efficiency and thrust to power ratios (T\/P), with difficulties predominantly being scaling to high power applications.  Specifically, Busek contends that such applications require more conventional propellant delivery mechanisms, which include latching and proportional flow control valves to manage the large amounts of propellant commensurate with kW-level electrospray propulsion.  As part of the Lisa Pathfinder mission, Busek has flight qualified and demonstrated on orbit such a feedsystem.  Busek proposes to develop a modularized electrospray emitter design suitable for production of arrays that are tailored for attachment to pressurized propellant sources.  Thruster performance shall be optimized for high efficiency and T\/P, targeting emission of small ion clusters.  A four emitter array (~20W) shall be demonstrated in the Phase I, with scaling to 100W or greater performed during the Phase II effort, and larger systems produced from additional stacking and\/or scaling.  Additionally, using novel power converter technology, Busek shall demonstrate increased high voltage generation efficiency, a key requirement for attaining system efficiencies approaching 70%.  Lessons learned will be implemented to develop scaling laws and designs necessary to approach the desired power levels in subsequent efforts."

        "abstract": "Green monopropellants have numerous performance and handling benefits over conventional propellants such as hydrazine. Many are derived from Ionic Liquids (IL) and are therefore well suited for use in electrospray electric propulsion systems. This affords the possibility of a multi-mode propulsion (MMP) capability, where both chemical and electric thrusters share a common propellant. Recently, Busek became the first to operate an electrospray thruster in space via the NASA ST7\/ESA Pathfinder mission. Busek is also a leader in developing novel green monopropellant thrusters and is therefore poised to create and demonstrate MMP systems. Busek proposes to address presently gating challenges associated with electrospray-MMP systems. First, high thrust density emitters will be developed within the strict material compatibility constraints imposed by candidate propellants. Subsequently, an inline propellant processing unit will be developed to both appropriately distribute the liquid phase propellant and provide electrical isolation. In Phase I, the thruster head performance will be optimized towards high T\/P and Isp &gt;1000s, through targeting efficient nanodroplet beams, and demonstrated with propellant supplied via the inline processing unit. In Phase II the technology will be scaled towards a high power, 100s of W, system operated end-to-end with Buseks existing green monopropellant compatible tanks and valves."

        "abstract": "The Electric-Based Combined Cycle (EBCC) thruster is a new approach to spacecraft propulsion that combines the high thrust of a chemical combustion system and the high Isp of an electric propulsion thruster into a single thruster. In EBCC, a chemical propellant is burned in a sub-100 N rocket within a pulsed EP system. That decomposed, hot, neutral gas is then accelerated in a 5kWclass neutral entrainment thruster. Neutral entrainment uses molecular charge-exchange and dissociation processes in a pulsed electromagnetic accelerator to lower ionization losses and dramatically increase the total thrust-to-power. This coaxial geometry decreases overall system mass and complexity, while simultaneously increasing performance. By harnessing the momentum and chemical energy of the combustion propellant and entraining it in a plasma stream, a T\/P can be increased to 110+ mN\/kW at 1000 s on these lightweight propellants. This Phase I program will answer the challenges associated with combining a high flow chemical system with a low flow EP thruster. An experimental investigation will demonstrate the operation of a neutral entrainment thruster with a pulsed, high temperature gas injector. Additionally, this program will increase the fundamental understanding of the molecular species dynamics within a neutral entrainment process through analytical and experimental investigations."

        "abstract": "The current surface activation process used to activate the surface of landing gear parts uses an aggressive grit blasting technique prior to electroplating. This technique is effective, but requires large amounts of blast media, requires a pre-cleaned surface and the process removes up to 0.1mils of substrate, much more than necessary. There is an urgent need for a process that can easily and effectively activate surfaces for electroplating without removing more than a few atoms of substrate. Atmospheric Plasma Solutions, Inc. (APS) has developed an Atmospheric Plasma Surface Treatment (APST) technology that can quickly and effectively surface activate a wide variety of substrates using only air and electricity by producing a cold, atmospheric pressure plasma beam which is directed at the surface to be activated.  Any organic surface contaminants and loose inorganic debris is etched away leaving a nearly atomically clean surface.  This proposed effort will focus on development of a conceptual design of this application, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach, and ensuring the ability of the APST process to meet stated DoD requirements. This effort will also lay the groundwork for subsequent scale-up of the process and further engineering development."

        "abstract": "During the overhaul process of aircraft and landing gear at Hill AFB, various high strength (HSS) aircraft components must have surface plated coatings periodically replaced.  Some of those coatings include chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), electro-less nickel (E-Ni), cadmium (Cd), low hydrogen embrittlement (LHE ZnNi) and phosphate. To achieve acceptable adhesion properties from the plated coatings, the HSS surface must be activated and all corrosion\/contamination must be removed by blasting the components with 120-grit aluminum oxide. After which, some plating process require that 300M HSS components, which has a high silica content, have additional activation in an ammonium bifluoride H2SO4\/NH4HF2 bath. The ammonium bifluoride bath chemistry is intermediate rout to hydrofluoric acid, which is a very hazardous chemical, poses high risk to personnel, and is corrosive to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. Additionally, grit blasting, if not done properly, can be abusive to HSS landing gear\/aircraft components and contaminated grit can cause galvanic corrosion. Consequently, during this SBIR Phase I project, ES3 proposes to complete the research necessary to demonstrate feasibility of replacing the current surface activation process with a alternative surface activation technology that is be safer for plating personnel and less abusive to landing gear\/aircraft components."

ES3 will demonstrate AM feasibility for landing gear, manufacture and qualify an AM landing gear part, and commercialize AM for landing gear. Phase I focuses on suitable AM processes and materials for landing gear with a feasibility evaluation for design, analysis, AM materials, AM processing, post processing, NDI, qualification, and facility requirements for AM landing gear parts. Based on our industry involvement, ES3 believes that the feasibility study will support pursuit of Phase II funding for rapid development and qualification of this emerging technology. Final commercialization is realized with an AM production specification and AM production parts."

This fabrication technology is based on direct-write technique using helium focused ion beam (FIB). In this project, we will capitalize on the already achieved results showing SQUIDs with much lower flux noise than typical HTS SQUIDs. We will investigate the effects of non-uniformity and dimension on linearity, dynamic range and noise. We will simulate and design magnetometer and gradiometer circuits integrating a helium ion beam HTS SQUID and a flux concentrator to substantially increase sensitivity. Designs comprising both planar washer type direct-inject and multilayer SQUID input coils will be simulated, designed and evaluated. In Phase II, we plan to develop a compact, portable prototype magnetometers and gradiometers . These sensors will be characterized in a flux-locked loop to determine their sensitivity, bandwidth and dynamic range. Devices will be operated in a micro-dewar and\/or on compact cryocoolers to determine practical size and weight requirements, noise properties and other capabilities. In Phase III, we will produce and market magnetometers and gradiometers for  biomedical and non-destructive evaluation instrumentation."

        "abstract": "An integrated measurement sensor for carbon-carbon (C-C) structures is needed for testing in arc jet facilities to meet testing needs for current and future hypersonic flight systems.   A commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) high frequency response pressure sensor and a fabricated temperature, heat flux, and recession sensor built directly into a C-C substrate will be integrated into a test article for future arc jet testing. Utilizing a redundant sealing architecture, this work will also demonstrate that the as-designed sensor assembly and integration methodology enables rapid repair and\/or replacement of the individual sensors on the assembly if a single sensing device fails in the field. The entire sensor assembly does not require active cooling and therefore this test assembly is suitable for incorporation into future flight test programs. The sensor assembly will utilize a super high temperature Kulite pressure transducer for pressure measurements, and one of two types of temperature \/ heat flux sensors. The first design uses a novel W-Re thin-film thermocouple (TFTC) array for surface temperature measurements, subsurface temperature measurements, and C-C recession rate. The other design, implemented for schedule risk reduction, uses a conventional temperature plug design based on individual thermocouples buried in the C-C substrate at known depths."

        "abstract": "LumArray, Inc. is developing a low-cost maskless photolithography system that will meet the resolution, placement-accuracy, overlay, throughput and multilevel-alignment requirements of integrated photonic and electronic devices. The University of Utah has developed methods to design and characterize a new class of metamaterial-based photonic devices that, compared to existing photonic devices and proposed plasmonic devices, offer higher levels of integration, higher photon efficiency, novel functionalities and compatibility with CMOS.  The designs take into account the practical aspects of nanofabrication, thereby enabling efficient photonic-electronic integration on the same chip.  The highly compact metamaterial devices will provide: (1) efficient coupling of light from fiber to waveguides; (2) conversion from multi-mode to single-mode propagation; (3) efficient mode separation based on polarization; and (4) efficient mode separation based on wavelength.   In Phase 1, Univ. Utah will design exemplary photonic-metamaterial devices. These will then be patterned at LumArray using its maskless photolithography and etching capabilities, and returned to Utah for characterization and design iteration. In Phase 2 the team will demonstrate a system that integrates the novel photonic devices with simple electronic devices in a CMOS-compatible process. In Phase 3, we will pursue commercialization in conjunction with OpSis and similar foundries."

        "abstract": "Continuing demands for increased compute efficiency and communication bandwidth have led to the development of novel interconnect technologies with the potential to outperform conventional electrical interconnects. Nowadays, optical communication with passive photonic waveguides which supports GHz data rate and multiple communication channels (WDM) has been widely applied in large scale optical net-works in order to improve the energy efficiency. However, due to the intrinsic properties of light such as diffraction limit and adjacent crosstalk, the passive photonic waveguide is still hard to be densely integrated on-chip on the footprint aspect comparing with electronic wires. This also further limits the adaptation of high performance optical devices and still makes the conventional electronics communication network hard to beat in the on-chip level. For active devices such as modulators, this means fulfilling optical switching operations within light propagation distances of just a few wavelengths.  In this proposal Dr. Dalir from Omega Optics Inc. in collaboration with University of Texas at Austin propose a photonics integrated circuit for ultrafast- sensing and switching based on ultra-dense packaging."

        "abstract": "To address Air Force needs for a low-latency multispectral helmet-mountable near-to-eye augmented-reality system, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new See-through All-weather Laser-projection Augmented-Reality Digital Multispectral Vision Goggles (STALAR-DMVG) with a wide field of view (FOV) and a high-resolution multispectral imagery overlay via common-aperture sensor blending, enabling low-latency performance with low size, weight, and power (SWaP) in a rugged structure. STALAR-DMVG is based on unique integration of key POC technologies: (1) a thin see through ellipsoidal off-axis collimator lens; (2) a scanning laser projector light engine providing high definition resolution, wide-FOV three-color imagery with near eye-limiting-resolution; (3) an integrated common-aperture multispectral imaging sensor based on an extremely compact wide FOV monocentric objective lens; and (4) a field programmable gate array-based low-power parallel-pipeline electronic processor providing low latency computing hardware and software. Innovated use of scanning laser display and narrowband coatings allows simple distortion correction and low light leakage enhancing situation awareness. In Phase I, POC plans to develop a low-SWaP, high-performance STALAR-DMVG design suitable for battlefield airman use, demonstrating the feasibility of meeting Air Force needs. In Phase II, POC will develop a working proof-of-concept prototype and demonstrate its capabilities for integration into Battlefield Airman Operation (BAO) kit."

        "abstract": "In this proposal, we propose Data Driven Activity Based Intelligence with Probabilistic Knowledge Graph. address the ABI bottlenecks of current approaches by developing comprehensive methodologies to leverage available multi-INT data to extract entities and correlations to enable pattern discovery and abnormal detection of activities. Because large amount of data via persistent sensors are available, advanced processing architectures with unified representation to accommodate big data are required. We propose to leverage existing state-of-the-art technologies to incorporate Multi-INTs using Knowledge Graph representation with the lambda framework to analyze data in both batching processing and streaming processing. We seek to develop a framework and technical underpinnings for Data Driven Activity Based Intelligence and apply the framework to address challenging problems in the current multipolar military threat environment. Specifically, the proposed technologies are grounded in the advanced georeference discovery algorithm, probabilistic Knowledge graph representation and inference, hypothesis management, and pattern discovery. The goal is to provide a solution for the case of unknown-unknowns for intelligence analysis where no models or signatures are given to discover activities. The resulting technology will enable advanced intelligence analysis by allowing a more complete understanding of the Activity Based Intelligence operational picture."

The technological foundation is a massive multi-analyst multi-domain analytics laboratory (M3AL) that models analyst interactions as an ecosystem platform beyond just an aggregator tool. The ecosystem of analytics is a unified, cross-domain experimentation platform for multiple analytics that will be used to identify causalities among variables across domains, predict tool evolution and survival, analyze analyst behavior and reproduce results. We will develop the novel analytics ecosystem M3AL to discover and recommend the most relevant analytics (across domains) mapped to different missions tasks. M3AL will produce a real world network of analytics and apply advanced machine learning and graph analysis techniques to automatically select the most suitable tool or set of tools from this network for a mission within the given domain. We will first develop a stack of analytics categories. Then, we will build an analytics ecosystem platform tunable in terms of frequency of usage, description and controlled variables representative of these analytics. As output, it will generate a set of causalities among analytics and their variables, analytics performance, analytics description, analytics tags (explicit or hidden), and underlying mechanisms to assure effective mission tasking."

        "abstract": "To address the Air Force need for a GPS-denied relative navigation (RelNav) technology to be used by Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) refueling, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Airborne Unmanned Refueling Multi-aperture Optical Navigation (AURUM-ON) system. The proposed navigation system is based on a novel compound-eye insect optic(s) and proven avionic components to achieve a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) mature system design. The innovation in wide field of view, multi-aperture configuration, customized beacons, high bandwidth, and custom embedded processing will enable the AURUM-ON system to detect, track and guide RPA during air-to-air refueling. As a result, AURUM-ON offers accuracy, availability, continuity, and wide-angle tracking without gimbals in a high-integrity solution directly addressing the Air Forces air platform requirements. In Phase I, POC will design a system and demonstrate the feasibility of AURUM-ON through analysis of expected required navigation performance (RNP) capabilities in terms of accuracy, integrity, availability, and continuity; discuss data and equipment requirements; and identify government-furnished equipment (GFI) required for Phase II. In Phase II, POC plans to build an AURUM-ON prototype for laboratory testing with hardware-in-the-loop simulation to evaluate RNP metrics and certification impacts."

        "abstract": "The ability to refuel piloted aircraft in flight is considered a strategic military asset and has been a critical element of success in nearly every US and NATO military engagement of the jet age. Equally important going forward will be the ability to refuel remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) in flight. Current USAF RPAs rely on cruise at low speeds and small payloads to extend endurance to accomplish their missions without refueling. But future RPAs will need speed and larger payloads, therefore decreasing endurance and creating greater operational need for these future RPAs to be equipped with automated aerial refueling (AAR) technology. Despite the many challenges of automating aerial refueling, AAR has been successfully demonstrated with the X-47B AAR program and previously with AFRL AAR flight test demonstrations. However, while successful, these AAR technologies depend largely on Global Positioning System (GPS) as the primary signal for relative navigation. GPS has proven to be extremely vulnerable to deliberate and inadvertent jamming, spoofing, and other effects. To break the dependence on GPS, CTSi proposes a multi-band, multi-sensor system capable of providing a robust, high reliability, safe positioning capability for AAR using independent sensors that are available at all times in all environments."

Through MAI expertise in spacecraft design, APL expertise in weather sensors and weather data, and Emergent expertise in cluster flight, our solution will provide the Department of Defense (DOD) critical and timely global weather imagery. Our innovative commercial system will deliver weather data as a service to replace gaps that will eventually arise due to the retirement of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This system will utilize a constellation of small satellites hosting a sensor suite including low-light visible imagers (LLI), short-wavelength IR (SWIR), medium-wavelength IR (MWIR) and long-wavelength IR (LWIR) cameras. In Phase I, we will achieve a CDR level design (exceeding the required PDR level of maturity), enabling us to rapidly develop a fully qualified satellite in Phase II. Our Phase II\/III baseline delivers a 6U CubeSat hosting APL LLI and LWIR cameras and Emergent flight software to demonstrate our concept with a NimbuSat pathfinder."

        "abstract": "The upcoming gap in satellite weather data may be a significant crisis in the early 2020s, with the cancellation of the NPOESS satellite program, and the loss of the DMSP-19 Satellite. Weather sources resources are stretched thin, which may make the US reliant on foreign weather data. We propose a new Cubesat satellite called Gemini,  which would be a pathfinder satellite for an Operational Responsive Meteorology Constellation called MetNet. The Gemini-A instrument proposed here is a multi-spectral imager which uses 32 MODIS bands for fast and simple theater weather imaging, all within a 1.5U CalPoly CubeSat standard.  This is made possible through the innovative use of newer technologies, such as the High Operating Temperature MWIR FPA at 120K and a newly available Low-Light-Level CMOS Image Sensor. The most significant challenges will be the system, thermal, and electrical design involving integrating four cameras into a 1.5U form factor. Gemini-B would be a separate 3U Microwave Sounder, such as the Mirata CubeSat built by MIT-Lincoln Labs, and would be part of a later effort. As with AURA and JPSS, the combination of IR and Microwave Sounder would work synergistically to provide a total solution for Cloud Characterization."

We bring significant innovations into this spacecraft design including the Busek BHT-600 Hall Effect Thruster electric engine using iodine gas propellant sublimated from highly dense solid iodine in a compact tank, the high performance MMA R-HaWK Solar Arrays carrying 33% efficient IMM solar cells, and Lawrence Livermores 35 cm Aperture Compact Monolith SSA sensor for performing the mission. For this SBIR, Millennium will work with subcontractors Busek and MMA Design to do trade studies on the propulsion, power, and spacecraft options and develop preliminary design-level satellite.  In considering the Agile Inspector Satellite design, there is a significant trade to be done on spacecraft sizing. The smaller the spacecraft, the less expensive and easier to find a ride. However, the smaller the satellite, the smaller the payload carried. In addition, Solar-Electric Propulsion systems do not scale down effectively and lose efficiency affecting overall performance."

This solar electric satellite inspector could be launched as a low cost secondary payload.  For primary propulsion, the spacecraft will carry a high specific impulse Hall Effect thruster (HET).  The available change in velocity (V) will exceed 6 km\/s, allowing unprecedented orbital maneuverability including transfers from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary orbit (GEO) coupled with additional maneuvers in GEO.   In Phase I, Busek will conduct system trades to identify an inspector satellite mission concept that will provide better than 0.1m resolution imagery of several GEO satellites. The work plan will include requirements definition, mission analysis, spacecraft design, and program planning.  Appropriate sensor\/telescope options, orbital configuration, and downlinks will also be identified.  The spacecraft will be designed to survive a slow journey from LEO to GEO through the radiation belts."

The enabling technology at the heart of the coherent optical transmitter array is a state-of-the-art silicon photonic frequency comb generator and high extinction ratio wavelength demux.  The transmitter array will consist of 60 emitter channels, an inter-channel spacing of 100GHz and 200W of output power with 45dB sidemode suppression per channel.  The system architecture design will reduce chip complexity by minimizing the total number of unique SiP and CMOS components along with providing a chip layout that provides a reduced footprint of &lt; 1mm2.  The total noise performance of the chip will be modeled, yielding an determination of the level of optical signal coherence within and across all emitters.  Lastly, the resulting complete SiP transmitter chip design will be shown to be compatible with commercial foundry procedures and will provide a viable path to achieve the scalability and the increased per channel output power required by the next phase target specifications."

        "abstract": "Coherent communications and general optical sensing rely on highly coherent, low-noise optical carriers, by which information carried in phase quadratures and spectroscopic signatures can be decoded with high confidence. While the need for low-noise carriers is currently fulfilled by discrete single-wavelength emitters, the scaling of discrete emitter arrays for supporting typical sensing and communications needs easily violates the SWaP envelope of mobile and airborne platforms, rendering deployment infeasible. Besides these scalability limits, disjoint optical construction of individual emitters renders the frequency and phase of optical carriers uncorrelated and wandering in time, thereby forbidding joint detection of channels in which the relative phase of all channels must be known. Contrary to discrete arrays, a chip-scale emitter array can be constructed with optical performance comparable to discrete counterparts. This monolithic approach will allow orders of magnitude reduction of size and power consumption, brought by shared packaging and environmental (temperature) control. Furthermore, phase-coherent emitter arrays can be built with strict phase correlation among channels, rendering joint channel detection possible. RAM Photonics proposes a new class of emitters with  80 carriers, at  300 microWatts each and OSNR of  45dB, spaced on 100GHz or denser ITU grid."

        "abstract": "This Phase I SBIR proposal addresses the Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) using the process of Die Extraction and Reassembly (DER). The DER process takes an IC die equivalent to the obsolete die from an undesirable and outdated package and reassembles that die into the needed package, hybrid or MCM. DER is an innovative and cost effective alternative solution to other higher cost solutions such as redesign of obsolete ICs.   The tools, techniques, and knowledge needed to certify DER parts for military use are still under development.  Innovations, as proposed in this project, would lead to tools and techniques that will eventually result in a certification process similar to those in place for MIL-STD-883 compliant parts.  Key aspects of Phase I of this program are as follows: 1. Die Extraction of a complex high pin-count plastic package. 2. Reassemble extracted die on LTCC Substrate along with passive components towards a self-contained Multi-Chip Module (MCM), with embedded passive components and thermal management structures. 3. Perform MIL-STD-883 compliant testing such that the new part created from DER process meets or exceeds all military standard specifications. 4. Develop transition plan\/business case analysis, with industry partners."

A critical component for enabling anti-jam techniques for implementation in GPS receivers is a high performance Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).  The ADCs must have high conversion frequencies to support the modernized and future GPS receiver architectures while having a very high resolution to provide the dynamic range required to counter potential jamming and interference threats.  RBS Technologies, LLC has developed a technical approach which combines a unique asynchronous N bit ADC with pipelined and oversampling techniques to obtain the required performance objectives.  The asynchronous ADC completes an N-bit conversion is one clock cycle with N comparators.  The combination of energy efficiency and high conversion frequency makes the ADC an attractive building block for a high performance and high resolution ADC.  RBS Technologies will exploit the previous experience of key personnel with designing and fabrication of CMOS Nano-technology ADCs and Anti-jam GPS receivers."

A proposed solution is to use frequency hopping techniques to communicate in a spectrum space free of hostile jammers and an all digital radio in which the agility and robustness is provided by high dynamic range and ENOB (16 bit) data-converters. To this end, broadband high dynamic range ADCs are needed to cover the broad-spectrum of interest allowing full coverage from GPS L1 to L2. To meet this demand, MaXentric proposes to take advantage of our previous program success in L-band ADC design Phase I and expertise in digital pre-distortion linearization correction. Our solution is comprised of classical pipelined ADC IC design married with advanced digital correction techniques to meet the solicitation of &gt;100 MS\/sec and ENOB of 16 bits."

        "abstract": "US Department of Defense (DOD) branches utilize aluminum and steel alloys for components throughout the different weapon systems. Traditionally brush cadmium (Cd) plating is used for local touch up after Cd plating operations and during repair and overhaul.  Both the Cd plating process and the hex-chromate conversion coating typically used have proven to be toxic (unlike other processes such as chromium plating, where a hazardous process yields a non-hazardous coating).  Consequently, ES3 successfully completed research via SBIR topics AF071-320 and AF081-101 for Cd replacement with LHE Alkaline Zinc Nickel Electroplating with non-hex chromate conversion coating for high and low strength steel aircraft general and threaded components and fasteners; and on aluminum and steel electrical connectors under SBIR topic AF161-007.  ES3 will leverage lessons learned during these previous efforts to develop, test and evaluate brush plating chemistries that can be utilized in lieu of existing brush Cd and Zn-Ni chemistries currently approved.  In Phase I, ES3 will investigate\/develop brush Cd plating chemistry alternatives, including hex-chrome free conversion coatings, and conduct the feasibility study and testing necessary to demonstrate USAF preliminary evaluation criteria for steel and aluminum applications that were previously Cd or Zn-Ni plated or IVD Al coated."

Moving antennas away from Brigade and Battalion command posts is critical to improving their survivability against an opponent that can find and attack our command and control (C2) assets. Correctly designed, the same antenna remoting equipment can also improve command post agility with reduced setup and teardown times, plus simplify command post configurations. To achieve the best feasible and operationally desirable approach to antenna remoting, Syntonics applies our systems engineering expertise to: Perform an all-encompassing trade study of alternative methods for remote combat net radio\/antenna placement; Analyze approaches and opportunities for signal aggregation based on command post radio and platform distribution, and antenna aggregation for multiple transmitters and receivers; analyze the potential for aggregating transceivers by band; and Analyze packaging and power approaches for the remote systems. We develop a comprehensive white paper that substantiates findings, draws conclusions about how best to remote antennas and, during the Option period, develop a conceptual design for the Phase II prototype system."

        "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing (commonly known as 3D printing) is fast growing technology that reaches the point of increased adoption in various production environments. This unique technology allows fabrication of complex parts rapidly and cost effectively.Additive Manufacturing (AM) of plastic parts is well developed and several methods exist to fabricate components such as Filament Extrusion, Vat Photopolymerization, and Binder Jetting. While plastic AM is mature, the barriers for adoption of the technology, particularly, for military applications are significant.Parts created by plastic AM methods lack functionality due to limited selection of materials and poor performance.Lynntech proposes to develop an electroless plating approach for the deposition of tribological coatings on parts produced using Fused Deposition Modeling and Stereolithography. Electroless plating will allow uniform coating throughout the part regardless parts complexity. Lynntechs unique coating formulation will provide enhanced wear and friction resistance, hardness, high temperature protection, and improved mechanical performance. We will evaluate performance of printed parts as a function of coating conditions to develop process specifications and guidelines. The developed technology will be well defined, predictable, and reproducible. Ultimately, Lynntechs plating method and formulation will greatly enhance manufacturing of unique, high value, low volume components for military applications."

        "abstract": "The Army is seeking the development of achromatic lens technologies to reduce the space and weight of optical systems. To address this Army need, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a novel Single Element Achromatic Lens (SEAL) technology based on metamaterials, dielectric nanoantennas, and form birefringence. The novel use and arrangement of the dielectric nanoantennas allows for achromatic focusing. The SEAL uses a monolayer metamaterial, which is thin and ultralight. Its achromatic behavior allows for focusing over a broad band of light without additional color correction features. Additionally, the SEAL is highly configurable to offer the desired lens properties. The simple SEAL design allows for cost-effective fabrication using advanced nanoimprint lithography. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate SEAL feasibility by designing, simulating, fabricating, and testing a prototype. In Phase II, POC plans to further develop a fully operational SEAL by refining and optimizing the design, developing the complete manufacturing process for mass production, and conducting thorough evaluation of optical performance in comparison to conventional lenses. By the completion of Phase II, we will have a mature working prototype that meets all Army requirements."

This 640x512 6um pitch InGaAs imaging system will be able to image light from 0.4 to 1.7um enabling the precision engagement of targets during the day and night as well as in fog and through smoke using the advantages of SWIR imaging. In addition this imager will enable the user to image and track laser designators and pointers deployed on the battlefield. The advantage of InGaAs SWIR imagers is their ability to conduct long range imaging through the atmosphere better than visible while being an uncooled infrared technology. We have shown that InGaAs SWIR imagers survive the 20,000g gun shock. We will be manufactured a small 300 frame per second needed to meet the imaging needs of the user to track targets while inside small gun launched projectile."

        "abstract": "The accuracy and integrity of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) sources are critical components of modern military operations. These requirements must be met in all operational environments, including situations where GPS signals are degraded or denied. While selective-availability anti-spoofing module (SAASM) enhanced GPS receivers provide greatly improved performance over civilian systems, they are not capable of providing accurate navigation solutions in all operational environments. This limits the mission effectiveness of existing systems and creates a need for improved performance. To address this need, we propose to develop a Portable Aided Navigation and Timing for Human Enabled Reckoning (PANTHER) system, designed to operate within the Nett Warrior common operating environment (COE). PANTHER is an innovative approach that seamlessly combines the full range of embedded sensors, an optimal robust nonlinear fusion engine, and a modular system architecture which enables us to greatly increase the PNT accuracy, availability, and integrity of the Nett Warrior system. PANTHER offers soldiers a system that is lightweight, intelligent, and mission effective."

        "abstract": "Carbon nanotube (CNT)-based copper hybrid-conductors, density ~5 g\/cc, at copper level conductivity potentially have an ampacity of two orders of magnitude above bulk copper. In this proposal, we posit that by improving CNT wire conductivity and coupling with copper infiltration we will achieve these goals. This extraordinary ampacity and conductivity come from suppressing electromigration coupled with the extreme charge-carrier mobility through the CNT pathways. Achievement of these goals encompass two processes: (1) Removing the fundamental structural\/physical obstructions to charge carrier transport in CNT conductors by doping to a higher density of charge carriers, addressing alignment factors, atomically cleaning the surfaces, reducing the effect of Schottky barriers and minimizing growth defects through processing. Our goal is &gt; 20 x 10^6 S\/m for CNT yarn alone, and then (2) Infiltrating this CNT fiber with copper to take advantage of the very high CNT charge carrier mobility and high charge carrier density in copper. The demonstrated suppression of electromigration by CNTs within copper is key to ampacity increases. We will have a plied composite Cu\/CNT cable fabricated commercially. A new manufacturing process to produce Cu\/CNT hybrid wire by infiltrating molten copper inside the CNT fiber is described."

This process includes measuring key sensor parameters and also tuning control parameters so the vehicle will operate properly. This proposed research will develop techniques for self-calibration of sensor parameters and automatic tuning of control system parameters for autonomous ground vehicles. The sensor parameters will include sensor locations, orientations and scale factors required for accurate measurement use. An Extended Kalman filter framework is proposed that allows key sensor states to be augmented into localization filter that exists on the vehicle. The automatic tuning will improve the control of the vehicle while driving in autonomous mode. A Model Predictive Control framework is proposed to make this possible. The MPC gains will be improved by monitoring the actual trajectory of the vehicle against a benchmark optimal trajectory. The difference between the paths is used as feedback into the controller gains calculation. The actual gains used in the MPC will converge to optimal values over time. This work will be implemented in simulation and also initial results will be obtained from actual vehicles."

        "abstract": "MATSYS proposes to develop and demonstrate warheads capable of perforating light armored vehicles and unmanned aerial systems, coupled with a follow through mechanism that will defeat various targets. Shaped charge liners require explosives to drive the collapse of the liner and subsequent formation of the jet. This is an inherently inefficient process because only 10% of the liner mass is used to form the jet. In addition, the energy transfer from the detonation products into kinetic energy of the liner is woefully inefficient, primarily because of the shock impedance mismatch between the detonation products and the typical copper liner. Lower density materials, such as aluminum, have better impedance matching to the explosive, and therefore the transfer of energy is more efficient. Unfortunately, aluminum liners do not make good jets. This problem can be alleviated through the development of bi-metallic liners, with the liner material placed closest to the explosive couples well with the explosive (i.e., impedance matching) while the material on the other side forms a well-performing jet. The selection of reactive materials will further enhance performance. Our approach is to use modeling and simulation to identify novel material combinations, and develop designs for bi-metallic liners and associated prototyping technology."

        "abstract": "Current supercapacitors have a very long cycle life, high charge\/discharge rates, high specific power, but relatively low specific energy compared to batteries. The theoretical energy and power of supercapacitors is determined by their capacitance, working voltage windows, and conductivities of electrode materials\/electrolytes as a function of temperature. With recent advances in nanomaterials-based electrodes, the electrolyte primarily limits the performance of supercapacitors. Organic electrolyte-based supercapacitors are approaching their energy and power limits. Therefore, a safe cost-effective electrolyte with high conductivity and wide voltage windows over wide temperature ranges is needed for next-generation supercapacitors. Lynntech proposes to develop low-cost deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to widen the operational and storage temperature ranges while improving the electrode\/electrolyte interface for high energy and high power supercapacitors. During Phase I, Lynntech will develop advanced electrolytes based on appropriate eutectic mixtures utilizing DESs. The ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability will be evaluated over a wide temperature range. A preliminary cell fabrication and testing will be performed. During Phase II, Lynntech will fabricate and evaluate the prototype supercapacitors based on the optimal electrolytes and graphene-based electrodes, and deliver prototypes to the Army for validation. The large scale synthesis of electrolytes and electrode materials will also be explored."

As such these products are limited in both current capability and the ability to extend to new intelligence missions. Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop and implement advanced sensor fusion algorithms for EO\/IR and 3D point cloud data. The algorithms leverage measurement data fused in the image and 3D space to perform Aided Target Recognition\/Detection (AiTR\/AiTD) as well as persistent target tracking. Toyon proposes to utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to detect specific objects of interest, such as military vehicles, in the fused data."

        "abstract": "EPIR Inc. and Brimrose Corp. propose to design and fabricate an adjunct sensor consisting of four spectrometers to cover the wavelength range from ultraviolet (UV) to long-wave infrared (LWIR). Each spectrometer is an integration of an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) with either Si- or HgCdTe (MCT)- based photo-detector (PD). The sensor will be used to aid the existing Missile Warning\/Hostile Fire Indication Systems. Due to our success on a recently finished NASA project, our efforts in this Phase I project will be concentrated on (1) the design and fabrication of MCT PDs in the infrared ranges, (2) the design of AOTFs for the correspondent PDs, and (3) the design of the sensor system accommodating all four PDs with low size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP). In Phase II we will fabricate and demonstrate the functionality of the prototype system based on the design finished in Phase I.MCT is the dominating choice of material for infrared applications. AOTF offers excellent waveband selection capability with no moving parts, and is insensitive to mechanical vibration. The combination of MCT PD with AOTF offers significant advantages to meet the requirements and to lower the SWaP of the system."

        "abstract": "Geopolymers are a class of inorganic polymers that that are made from calcined clays or industrial waste products such as fly ash and slag. Geopolymer composites are fire resistant and stable to high temperatures such as 950C. These composites are half the weight, can be 5 times stronger than high-strength concrete, and can set at ambient temperatures. The BASE project will develop geopolymer composites reinforced with basalt fiber reinforcements in the form of chopped fibers, randomly oriented fiber mats, weaves, dog bone-shaped Minibars or auxetic basalt fibers.The resulting composites will be especially suited to high-performance, lightweight, multi-use purposes including building construction, force protection, and force projection applications. The project will then optimize for two specific applications: 1) road repair as an alternative to asphalt and 2) deployable structures such as helicopter pads. The geopolymer composite for road repairs will be optimized for setting time and maximum mechanical strength. Preliminary work will be done on the unfolding geometry of deployable structures for flat helipads. This will illustrate the principles for other rapidly deployable, transportable structures.The OPTION will perform initial tests of the composites in environments simulating real-world applications."

        "abstract": "Tissue engineering technology is of particular import to the Army for the matter of producing tissue replacements for the repair and regeneration of various organ systems (liver, heart, muscle, lung, etc.) for wounded patients. Unfortunately, the production of masses of tissue with thicknesses greater than ~1 mm presents a challenge due to diffusion limits of nutrients into the tissue and waste out of the tissue. This is solved through proper vascularization. Providing vasculature for lab-grown tissues (in addition to providing the correct nutrients, growth factors, etc.) is essential to keeping them alive and functional for any relevant length of time. In order to meet these challenges, Lynntech is proposing the development of a hybrid bioreactor\/3D-printing system in order to engineer vascularized tissue. We will demonstrate feasibility through the production of 1 cm thick, vascularized pieces of tissue. The Phase I development process will include fine-tuning the individual components of our system and evaluating the tissue for vascularization, health, and function over weeklong timescales. Testing will include metabolic assays, imaging of the vasculature, and mechanical testing. Methods and materials that meet the Armys objectives will be recommended for further development in Phase II and beyond."

These threats include LADAR, radar, and multi-spectral and hyper-spectral imaging sensors. While current camouflage systems provide concealment against most of these threats, they fail to protect against LADAR. Through holes in the net, LADAR systems can sense assets concealed below the net. Additionally, the smooth catenary or bowl-shaped appearance of deployed nets can cue LADAR detection.ThermoAnalytics Inc., together with Saab Barracuda USA and Milliken &amp; Company, will develop preliminary designs for strategies that deny or confuse LADAR detection of camouflage nets and assets. In the Phase I effort, the team will evaluate and estimate the performance of the strategies, create 3D models of net designs to identify strategies that can minimize catenary effects, and generate 3D point clouds using a LADAR simulation to investigate the effectiveness of the most promising strategies. Throughout the effort, the team will design in compatibility with the other requirements for ULCANS including concealment from other threat sensors, ventilation for thermal and wind loading, durability in field environments, lightweight, low cost, and short strike and erect cycles."

        "abstract": "Fire can act extremely quickly. In as little as 60 seconds a tent can be destroyed by fire, requiring very quick soldier reaction time to even survive. Improving fire safety begins with understanding the fire dynamics associated with each system. All current military shelters are evaluated for fire safety on a component basis only; there are no specifications for how the overall system design relates to generation of flame, heat, and smoke. As such, the Army needs a three-dimensional, reliable and validated fire model to simulate system-level shelter fire scenarios. The needed model will provide the Army with an effective, inexpensive method to perform iterative design, material, or configuration changes to any shelter design at low cost, avoiding the time and monetary investment in destructive live-fire testing. ADA Technologies proposes to leverage the extensive work done to develop FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator) and modify its solver to a stochastic one, called MC-FDS. In Phase I, ADA will develop an initial version of MC-FDS, and use it to perform modeling of corresponding small-scale experiments similar to ASTM D6413 using cotton sateen and PVC-coated polyester. Side-by-side comparison of the model output and tests will demonstrate the capabilities and promise of MC-FDS."

The US Army has a large stockpile of unused propellants and energetics that have exceeded their useful life and must be disposed of. Algenol proposes to build off of previous contract work that demonstrated the use of hydrolyzed M6 propellant waste nitrogen as a nutrient source for the biological production of transportation fuel. This next phase of that research would leverage Algenols proprietary algae based technology platform to use nitrogen, in the form of nitrate and nitrite, generated from the alkaline hydrolysis of M6 propellant to produce algal biomass in semi-continuous cultivation as a precursor to the production of biocrude via hydrothermal liquefaction. Utilization of M6 propellant in this manner would circumvent the need to dispose of the material by open burn\/open detonation and instead augment algal biomass growth and biofuel production thus reducing emissions and yielding a product that can be used as a transportation fuel by the general public or for military vehicles."

Therefore, reducing water demand, by treating greywater and reclaiming potable water, is needed to reduce the number of convoys necessary to deliver potable water and remove greywater from the field. 1.2 Technological advances which can create a more consistent filtration, smaller footprint, lighter weight and longer life will support this need."

Working with Jankel, an industry leader in military seating that has sold more than 70,000 seats worldwide, NanoSonic will employ a rigorous design of experiments that will enable the correlation and combinatorial optimization of the molecular composition, physical properties, and bulk morphology of its viscoelastic HybridSil foams to produce game-changing seat cushion padding that provides a previously unavailable combination of vibration isolation, pressure distribution, and blast protection. Direct comparative analysis demonstrating the value proposition of HybridSil seat cushion padding over legacy systems will be completed by Jankel team members through pressure distribution mapping, MAST vibration transmission analysis, and drop tower testing. NanoSonics seat cushion padding will be tailored to meet the objective weight requirement and have immediate utility as a replacement cushion or component in a new seat design. This program will build from NanoSonics innovative energy absorbing, fire resistant HybridSil materials that have independently validated ballistic \/ blast durability in excess of polyureas, transition to flexible insulating silicate networks at elevated temperatures, and a health rating of zero."

        "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems require wider bandwidth lasers. As such, domes for these systems require high transmissivity in the region 300 nm8500 nm. Current IR dome materials, such as sapphire or Y2O3:La, exhibit sufficient transmission to 300 nm (as expected for these wide band gap materials), but do not meet the IR transparency requirements. By contrast, ZnS domes exhibit sufficient transmission to wavelengths longer than 8500 nm, but ZnS also absorbs in the near UV. To satisfy the wideband transmissivity requirement of next generation IRCM systems, new materials must be developed and novel methods to discover these materials must be employed. Lumenari proposes to use a combination of supercomputing and experimental methods to rapidly screen optical and mechanical properties of crystalline materials to elucidate UV and IR absorption cutoff wavelengths, as well as factors contributing to durability, coefficient of thermal expansion and water\/air stability. This proposed approach will simultaneously maximize the probability of success and minimize the cost-per-material investigated. The work conducted in this Phase I project will yield a number of materials synthesizable in high purity at large quantities that are compatible with the IRCM transmission and durability requirements."

        "abstract": "Orbital Traction proposes to demonstrate, through research and modeling, the fuel efficiency and performance gains achievable on military vehicles through optimization of the driveline using an innovative torque multiplication technology. This system replaces the existing torque converter, thereby addressing energy inefficiency within the driveline in ground vehicle transmissions. The reduction in fuel consumption would enable longer mission durations and\/or increase operating ranges for the vehicles.Implementation of the new system, in conjunction with proper controls, is expected to yield a reduction in fuel usage, over standard mission profiles, by greater than 20%.Orbitals solution is a drop-in replacement for the torque converter and can be used to upgrade existing military transmissions.Leveraging prior DoD research, Orbital proposes research on a torque converter replacement with the novel application of an infinitely-variable speed transmission.Orbitals infinitely-variable transmissiontorque multiplier would eliminate many of the limitations of existing torque converters for heavy duty vehicles.The unit would provide a gear-neutral allowing input rotation with zero output rotation while maintaining output torque.At low speeds, substantially more torque can be produced.Packaging the system within the existing space claim minimizes the level of modification while maximizing performance improvements for optimum benefits."

        "abstract": "Conventional vehicle armor has evolved considerably over the years, including homogeneous plates, composite materials, and reactive substrates.Variable orientations have also been implemented, including curved, sloped, angled, and spaced plates.A common characteristic among these conventional armor solutions is that they are static and incapable of changing in response to local threats.Adding a means by which the armor panels of a vehicle can adapt, or change under the direction of an occupant, would provide an improvement in protection capability. Many conventional actuation technologies exist that have the required performance capabilities for adaptive armor, but are limited in practical utility primarily due to their weight.As such, InnoVital Systems, Inc., in collaboration with the University of Maryland, proposes to develop an innovative adaptive armor actuation system using our patented, light weight, pneumatic artificial muscles. Building upon our extensive experience and related patent portfolio, we will perform analyses and detailed design work in Phase I of the project that will end with prototype bench-top demonstrations of an armor panel actuator.Phase II will be focused on further refinements, closed-loop control, and integration into functional hardware capable of realistic operations in a relevant environment."

        "abstract": "The basis of this proposal is to introduce robotic and automation techniques to better remediate foreign object debris (FOD) form hangers, taxiways and engine bays. This increases the effectiveness of existing FOD technologies by (1) eliminating or minimizing problems with the manual manipulation of these technologies and (2) enhancing FOD removal systems by adding multiple remediation technologies (i.e., more than one FOD technology). In both cases, RTT will use when possible, off the shelf and commercially available technologies modified for specific FOD applications. Current FOD remediation techniques are generally good at removing most FOD, as much as 95% or more. However, if the FOD technology cannot reach or simply misses the FOD, the FOD remains. RTT has brought automation and automatic control to a number of industrial environments to increase a variety of performance characteristics including productivity, quality and consistency. The focus is on the operational side of demonstrating that roboticized FOD systems can work in the field. Research is focused in motion control, navigation, operational control and monitoring. The net result is to address the hard to get FOD that creates billions of dollars of damages annually in the airline industry."

Expensive noble metals are used as electrocatalysts and these precious metals contribute to approximately 25% of the cost of the electrolysis cell. Greatly reducing or eliminating the amount of noble metal electrocatalysts would significantly reduce the cost of the electrolysis cell stack. The Navy estimates that the cost savings would be ~$200,000 per electrolysis stack. Non-noble metal electrocatalysts are being developed, but so far no alternative has matched the performance of current Pt electrocatalystsThe objective of this Phase I project is to develop active electrocatalysts for PEM electrolyzers. We will prepare electrocatalysts using functionalized carbons as metal supports.We will optimize the metal content, as well as the physical properties (e.g., surface morphology and pore size distribution) of the new carbons and screen them based on their activity.We will prepare MEAs using the most promising materials and test their electrochemical performance under representative conditions.Based on the experimental results, we will carry out an engineering analysis to estimate cost of the new materials and compare them to current electrocatalysts."

CO has previously demonstrated significant benefits for organ preservation in small animal models, however, there were safety issues that impeded translation to the clinic. The immediate objectives in this Phase I feasibility proposal are construction of a CO releasing device prototype in collaboration with Lorenz Meinel, University of Wurzburg, and demonstration of effectiveness in a rat hind limb model. Expert surgeons from Johns Hopkins University will supervise limb procurement methods. The CO releasing devices will be placed in bags of organ preservation solution and activated prior to flushing and preservation of rat hind limbs. Our objectives will be addressed in three tasks:In Task 1 construction and preliminary evaluation of a therapeutic device designed to deliver 40 M CO will be performed. In Task 2 we will evaluate the CO releasing therapeutic device by rat limb flushing and static storage on ice. In optional Task 3 we will compare the impact of different CO concentrations on limb preservation. Evaluations will consist of skeletal muscle and vascular tissue physiology, metabolism and histology studies."

Cryopreservation is considered the answer, but remains a highly interdisciplinary problem that has yet to allow the successful full viability recovery of cells, tissues, and organs for on-demand applications. The use of cryoprotective agents (CPAs) like DMSO is hindered by their innate cytotoxicity and unfavorable effects in patients infused with DMSO containing HSCs. Opportunity lies in the development of a highly effective CPA or media system that significantly reduces or removes the use of harmful CPAs from cryoprotectant solutions. A cutting-edge preservation method and protocol is needed.Biomedical applications of hydrogels are ever growing with the advancement of antibiotic and traumatic wound care, time and location specific drug delivery, tissue engineering scaffolds, cell preservation, etc.X-Therma has engineered an advanced biomimetic cryoprotective matrix system for eventual use in bone marrow preservation. Phase I will focus on feasibility studies to assess the inherent cryoprotective effect of the matrix system. CD34+ cells will be encapsulated, subjected to a cryopreservation protocol and rewarming procedure. Simple cell assessment by live\/dead and metabolic activity assays will be used to show feasibility."

Surgical airways, the default procedure in many instances, are often unsuccessful and have high complication rates. Endotracheal intubation, the preferred approach to airway management, is often not possible because of environmental limitations, inadequate user skill or experience level, or patient limitations (e.g., airway trauma). Building on experience with device development for the combat medic, InnoVital will develop an unpowered, semi-autonomous system that leverages magnets to enable blind intubationimproving the success and ease of airway management in military and civilian pre-hospital settings. The approach also takes advantage of years of study of magnet-assisted intubation, refining and redirecting the solution for relevance to pre-hospital care. The SureTube system will be iteratively developed and prototyped to demonstrate feasibility in the Phase I effort. The envisioned solution will be familiar to medics in that the appearance and functioning of system components will be similar to commonly used airway tools. In addition to InnoVital Systems specific experience with the development of procedural aids for pre-hospital and acute care providers, existing relationships with relevant industry partners puts InnoVital in the best position for delivering a useful product."

First responders, combat medics, and casualty evacuation medics perform vital TC3 roles but are often overburdened by multiple casualties and overwhelmed by an increasing excess of sensor data that can be difficult to interpret in stressful and chaotic environments. Furthermore, injuries can be difficult to identify when symptoms are not obvious and treatment can be difficult to perform, depending on the skill of the performer. To address these challenges, we propose to design and evaluate Ensemble Prediction for Intelligent Combat Casualty Care (EPIC3), a mobile application that uses an ensemble of classifiers, frequently tuned via machine learning, to predict life-threatening and difficult-to-detect injuries. We will present the steps to treat those injuries through a simple, easy to use interface that tailors itself to the needs and skill level of the user."

        "abstract": "Using catheters to achieve venous access is extremely important during combat casualty procedures, and they are only getting more important in the 21st Century. Hemorrhage is a major cause of battlefield death, and indeed caused more than 90% of preventable deaths between 2001 and 2011, and rapid replacement of blood volume is thus extremely important to saving the lives of our warfighters. Catheters also are used to deliver drugs, like pain medications. A major problem with catheters is their propensity to lead to infections, namely catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSI). These infections can quickly become deadly, especially if they are caused by drug-resistant strains of bacteria or fungus. There is a clear need for new, effective methods to clean and sterilize catheters and their connections in combat environments. RemPhos Technologies LLC has developed a simple, hand-held, portable and reusable high intensity ultraviolet light source for automated simultaneous disinfection of hemodialysis catheter lumens and luer connectors. Under this project, the company will fabricate safe, operator-independent, high-intensity, miniaturized hardened device that is complete with miniaturized electronics; perfiorm UVA and UVC intensity measurements; and conduct definitive in vitro antimicrobial studies."

Repeated attempts are painful and lead to catheter failure due to other painful processes such as inflammation, infiltration and infection. Expert providers have higher first-pass success rates and lower incidence of IV failure, which translate to reduced pain for the patient. Through deconstruction of the most important and error-prone steps in IV placement, InnoVital Systems will design and build a device that allows novice users to perform like experts, increasing the ease and success rate of the procedure while reducing patient discomfort. The combined engineering and medical skillset and experience of the InnoVital team lowers the risk of the effort and enables its success. Furthermore, InnoVitals specific experience with the development of procedural aids for pre-hospital and acute care providers and existing relationships with relevant industry partners puts it in the best position for delivering a useful product."

        "abstract": "Chronic neuropathic pain is a commonly occurring condition and a painful and debilitating problem for millions of Americans. The bulk of these neuropathic pains result from induced peripheral neuropathies, most commonly associated with diabetes, chemotherapy-treated cancers, and extremity injuries. Many drugs that have been shown effective in pain management when taken orally have extremely narrow therapeutic windows to prevent toxicity or undesirable side effects. In order to address the issues with drug-treatment of peripheral neuropathy, Luna Innovations proposes the development of a unique and highly-controllable nanofiber-based transdermal drug delivery system known as TuneCoat-2TM for the delivery of liposome-based nerve targeting drugs. The drug delivery nanofiber dressing will be used topically at the site of injury, will be applied by the patient, and will be designed to function with compression garments to permit use by patients who also suffer from secondary lymphedema. The fabrication protocol will allow for inclusion of multiple drugs in a single bandage with control over the delivery of each drug. Lunas TuneCoat-2TM dressing will significantly advance treatment of peripheral neuropathies and will be designed using only FDA-approved polymers and drugs, providing a relatively straight-forward approach towards clinical studies, FDA approval, and marketing."

        "abstract": "Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) is a painful debilitating condition caused by progressive subcutaneous nerve damage due to diabetes, chemotherapy or as a result of traumatic combat injuries. Current treatment options for PN are only moderately effective but have numerous drawbacks such as systemic effects, inefficient drug delivery and toxicity. Furthermore, long term use of some PN therapeutics can potentially lead to dependency. Lynntech, Inc. proposes to develop a biocompatible epicutaneous gel system for topical and controlled delivery of a unique combination of targeted therapeutics to effectively treat peripheral neuropathy. This novel combination therapeutic and delivery strategy will be designed to perform the dual action of mitigating pain and blocking\/limiting nerve damage. The epicutaneous gel can be easily administered due to its familiar topical gel format. Phase I will provide proof-of-concept for efficacy of the combination PN therapeutic and delivery strategy using an appropriate in vitro 3D skin equivalent model. During Phase II development, an appropriate in vivo model of PN will be used to further develop the topical gel system for improved skin barrier penetration and optimal neuronal targeting ability. This innovative epicutaneous gel-based combination therapeutic system may significantly improve the quality of life of our soldiers with PN."

        "abstract": "The Army Operating Concept (AOC), published in 2014, describes the challenges faced by the Army when attempting to achieve victory in a complex world. In light of the concepts formalized in the AOC, it is clear that expeditionary Army operations are increasingly vital to maintain stability and security in a wide variety of complex, multi-faceted scenarios. Megacities, with populations over 10 million citizens, provide a unique challenge to expeditionary operations as they are deeply interconnected systems. As likely sources of future conflict, megacities are important in maintaining global stability and security. If the Army is to deploy expeditionary forces into megacity situations, it must be able to train its Soldiers to operate within them. Charles River Analytics, Inc. proposes to design and prototype a Multi-resolution Modeling and Simulation Toolkit (MultiMAST). MultiMAST will consist of a suite of component models for simulating megacity operations at both high and low resolutions, including a high-level model that integrates all component models and dynamically determines what resolution each section of the megacity will be modeled at, an interface that enables integration with other models such as OneSAF, and a trainer tool that allows intuitive authoring of training scenarios."

Progeny believes integration of open-source software solutions with existing computer-controlled test and monitor systems that provide system status to predict failure will significantly decrease equipment maintenance costs by automatically recommending corrective hardware maintenance prior to failure occurring.Progenys proposed solution will leverage automated data acquisition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), big data storage techniques, and automatic calculation system-subsystem fatigue status and life remaining to recommend corrective maintenance.Our true innovation for this effort will be to provide a capability which automatically receives component fatigue damage assessment, calculates impacts to dependent hardware, and recommends condition-based maintenance. The resulting software will support unsupervised receipt and capturing of monitored damage assessment reports through integration of our solution with existing monitoring sensor hardware and reporting systems."

        "abstract": "KCF Technologies understands that new CBM technology is required for realized Total Ownership Cost (TOC) reductions on many Navy platforms including winches. In particular, advanced solutions are needed to accurately predict component performance and maintenance from which overhauls can be reduced, work task times shortened, and maintenance logistics optimized. The lack of advanced monitoring technologies necessary to perform high fidelity diagnostics and prognosticswithin the constraints of most Navy platforms and logistics infrastructurerepresent a key technology gap that must be bridged to derive increased operational readiness and cost saving. In this project, advanced diagnostic and prognostic algorithms will be combined with KCFs mature commercial industrial machine monitoring solution. This marriage of technologies will be tailored and applied to the unique requirements of Navy winches."

(FTI) will develop and demonstrate an innovative, predictive condition-based maintenance forecaster that detects and diagnoses system performance degradation and forecasts time to failure as a means of reducing maintenance costs and increasing operational availability.The inability to anticipate corrective maintenance results in unscheduled outages that increase mean time to repair, decrease operational availability, and drive up costs.The forecaster will monitor system performance in real time, detect indicators of degradation and failure, diagnose the cause with a low probability of false alarm, determine time to failure and mission impact, and report to system stakeholders. The ability to predict the window for corrective action before an unscheduled system failure enables maintenance to be scheduled with the optimum use of time, people, tools and spares.The forecaster technical foundation consists of data-derived system performance analysis algorithms and processes using statistics, pattern recognition, machine learning and signal processing. At the completion of the project FTI will have demonstrated a forecaster that meets the requirements of the topic, can produce a report such as report such as, hardware A has a 90% probability of failure within the next 72-96 operating hours andcan meet the operational needs of the Navy."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for a real-time capability for anomaly-based detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in Internet Protocol based Combat System networks, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Statistical Intrusion Detection System Generating Policy-based Responses to Cyber Threats (STINGER) based on Markov decision processes and intelligent action policy. This combination provides artificial intelligence needed to detect and mitigate the APTs and both known and new cyber-attacks. STINGER monitors network traffic, dynamically detects and classifies attacks using statistical analysis and an anomaly-based intrusion detection mechanism. STINGERs infrastructure-agnostic intrusion detection\/response mechanism enables detection of currently undetectable new generation of cyber-attacks, such as highly distributed and coordinated attacks and low frequency attacks, as well as classification and mitigation of attacks. In Phase I, POC will develop STINGERs overall system architecture, framework and algorithms, and demonstrate feasibility by assembling and testing a prototype. In the Phase I Option we will refine the system design and prepare detailed technical specifications for the software to be developed in Phase II. In Phase II, POC will develop an advanced prototype to demonstrate real-time attack pattern detection and attack classification prediction model capabilities in representative enterprise networks and environments."

Boston Engineering has developed multiple underwater vehicle systems that deliver customer payloads, already overcoming common payload delivery issues such as changes to hydrodynamic loading and variances in system stability due to addition or removal of mass while providing high reliability attach\/detach mechanisms. Our solution is inexpensive and easily assembled to a COTS ROV. The compatibility of this system with existing demolition charges avoids impacting the controlled explosive supply chain. Our system is passive, removing cost and complication related to electrical or software integration into the COTS ROV. Phase I focuses on verifying the robustness of our design and proving individual subsystem functionality, minimizing risk to Phase II. We propose to provide a functional, TRL6 prototype, capable of neutralizer placement on bottom, moored, and floating mines at the conclusion of PHII or sooner."

        "abstract": "Organic mines are serious threats to U.S. naval ships. As a result, the Navys Airborne Mine Countermeasure Systems are in place to negate these threats. One of the systems, the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS), is a mine countermeasure that is intended to detect, classify and localize sea mines. The system is mounted on the MH-60S helicopter.The heart of the ALMDS is the streak tube imaging LIDAR, which allows a high area search rate capability for reconnaissance and assessment of mine threats in littoral zones, confined straits, choke points and amphibious objective areas.One ALMDS objective is to detect mines as deep under the water surface as possible. This objective requires a detection system with a very large dynamic range when the ALMDS operates inside turbid harbors, where the laser light quickly losses its intensity in the water. Unfortunately, the streak tube has relatively low dynamic range. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques to improve the dynamic range of the ALMDS.SA Photonics is pleased to propose the development of OPAL, which can improve the ALMDS dynamic range by more than 20 dB. OPAL is a complete add-on system; no ALMDS hardware alternation is needed."

The ability to accommodate glint, while maintaining sensitivity will also be demonstrated. The results of these tests will be used to develop the design of a fine-pixel-pitch 1,024 element linear avalanche photodiode (APD) receiver, which will be fabricated and demonstrated in Phase II, and shown to provide enhanced probability of target detection, with lower false alarms, compared to existing lidar receivers."

The trade study will use an innovative set of improvements that incrementally expand receiver subsystem performance in sensitivity, noise, resolution and fixed pattern noise. This validation leverages existing physical models of the receiver and the environment, and focuses on the existing camera-tube assembly as a base for high payoff, low risk incremental upgrades. The innovation in STIL-optimized CMOS imaging and streak tube integration will enable the program to significantly advance its detection performance without incurring excessive TRL risk. In Phase I, TSG will exercise models and conduct lab experiments with in house technology to produce a camera design and Phase 2 plan of action. In Phase II, TSG will build and test the new camera.In Phase 3, TSG will work with the program to displace the current production model using the Phase 2 camera design."

As the mast tilts in rough seas, the antenna can be operated in a dynamic mode that selects either the low-angle or high-angle gain pattern to maintain optimal gain toward a UFO\/MUOS satellite. This mitigates the gain rolloff that occurs with fixed-pattern mast antennas in real-world operational scenarios. Reflections off the sea that lead to scalloping of the gain pattern over the low elevation angles will be reduced by raising the antennas phase center to the top of the antenna when selecting the low-angle gain pattern and to the bottom of the antenna when selecting the high-angle gain pattern."

The innovation in electromagnetic field conditioning will enable reliable, high-gain, low-elevation-angle antennas for SDV in a small form factor. The Sub-GLEA is a monopole, wideband, high-gain, right hand circular polarization antenna, optimally designed for UHF SATCOM frequencies, that fits within an existing radome configuration. Therefore, this technology offers improved gain and elevation angle, which directly address the Navy requirements. Phase I focuses on conceptual design of the innovative low-elevation-angle UHF SATCOM antenna; POC will design the system, and will evaluate it against factors such as beam forming capability, gain, elevation angle, polarization, size, weight, power, cost, and radiation characteristics such as field of regard, instantaneous field of view, beam width, spectrum, and pattern tuning. In Phase II, POC will develop and demonstrate the feasibility with a prototype antenna and relevant drive electronics, through testing in an anechoic chamber or other suitable test facility."

        "abstract": "SARA proposes an approach for developing a vacuum pressure sensor based on a piezoelectric resonator capable of monitoring pressures ranging from 1 microTorr to &gt;2 atmospheres.Relatively small pressure-dependent shifts in the resonant frequency of such devices have been observed and reported in literature over the pressure range of interest. SARA intends to exploit this phenomenon using a proprietary control-circuit method that will enable significantly higher accuracy of the device relative to that of the published literature.This capability will enable pressure monitoring with acceptable accuracy over the full pressure range using a single low-cost sensing element. Development of this system will lead to a compact, fully-integrated, hermetically-sealed, and orientation-insensitive device capable of real-time vacuum pressure reporting. As the sensing element is built on the high reliability, long lifespan, and low cost of piezoelectric resonators, the device will allow for permanent integration into vacuum systems for system lifetime monitoring."

The antenna array emulates GPS satellite constellation by moving on rails, which emulate GPS satellite orbits. Each antenna emulates one GPS satellite and has the same angular speed with the GPS satellite it is emulating. In the GPS satellite emulation process, all antennas point their main lobes to the emulated earth center (or the GPS receiver antenna under test). The same length cables are applied to connect the multi-channel GPS satellite signal generator and antennas, which maintain the same phase\/time delay for all the antennas\/channels, and the phase delay difference due to the emulated orbits are calibrated. At the GPS receiver antenna, the delay difference is only due to the GPS satellites movement, which is generated by the multi-channel GPS satellite signal generator."

Our proposal is to leverage the results of our earlier work on advanced PEM electrolyzer catalysts into a project aimed at productionizing and optimizing the best candidate material. Since anode catalyst loadings are approximately one order of magnitude higher than currently proven cathode catalyst loadings we expect to concentrate our development efforts on the anode materials. We propose to run optimization experiments on the low PGM anode catalyst to optimize the anode loading at or below 0.25 mg\/cm2 which has been demonstrated to provide equivalent performance to our standard anode catalyst at 16 times that loading level. During the optional portion of the Phase I we propose to longevity test the down-selected catalyst loading at Navy submarine cell stack operating conditions. Our initial cost studies indicate that successful conclusion of this effort will definitively lead to a greater than 20% reduction in stack cost from the $1M figure stated in the solicitation to less than $800k."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a non-noble metal proton exchange membrane based electrocatalysts and engineered nanostructure for improved oxygen generator for submarines, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Cobalt Oxide (Co4O4) Nanocubane-based Oxygen Generator (CONOG) system. The proposed oxygen generator system is based on a novel design that utilizes electrospun Nafion nanofibers as the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM). In CONOG system, Co4O4 nanocubanes are used as efficient oxygen evolution catalysts. As a result, the proposed approach offers high proton conductivity at the pores of the Nafion nanofibers. Particularly, utilization of cobalt oxide nanomaterials as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, enables the system to improve oxygen generation and significantly reduce costs. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the CONOG system by fabricating a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) structure incorporated with cobalt oxide nanocubanes as catalysts for the water oxidation process. In Phase II, POC plans to build a prototype 4-cell stack incorporating improved electrocatalysts and novel MEA structures capable of operating at equivalent current density of 1000 ASF and at an equivalent oxygen generation rate of 225 SCFH."

        "abstract": "Third-generation focal plane arrays allow US Army soldiers to view high-resolution, high frame rate imagery across multiple infrared bands. To properly utilize the capabilities of these new sensors, including their high sensitivity across the SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR bands, third-generation imaging systems employ advanced optical systems with multiple refractive and reflective components. The number of surfaces, the large refractive indices of some of the infrared materials, and the large range of angular incidence associated with fast optics make it difficult to obtain multi-element infrared optical systems with high optical transmittance across a broad, multi-band spectral range. There is a need for new techniques and processes that can increase the spectral transmittance of the optical system components (infrared lenses, windows, and beamsplitters), and allow third-generation imaging systems to achieve their full potential. Nanohmics, Inc. and the Optical Structured Surfaces Laboratory at the University of North CarolinaCharlotte are working together to apply optimized random anti-reflective surface structure (rARSS) technology to address the spectral transmittance requirements associated with the optical components of third-generation imaging systems."

        "abstract": "The goal of this program is to develop and demonstrate a wiring system with the ability to detect faults and autonomously mitigate them through self-healing or self-rerouting. The wiring system must be ruggedized to survive the harsh operating conditions and environment that exist in the hull of military aircraft; this includes nearly constant vibrations, temperature extremes, and potential exposure to chemicals. To be implemented, the system needs to be as compact, versatile, and low weight as possible in addition to being comparable in cost to traditional wiring systems. The system also needs to be designed such that it can be retrofit in existing aircraft without the need for specialized equipment. Nano Terra will team with North Carolina State University (NCSU) to develop an integrated self-healing wiring system. This will build on the developments at NCSU for self-healing technologies, and the means to control their re-routing. Nano Terra will integrate these technologies in the wiring system and will lead the network sensing and control efforts as well as overall system design and integration."

(HMC) herein proposes a novel approach to drastically reduce the instances of FOD damage to the U.S. Navy AV-8B Harrier. This system, coined the FOD-Vacuum Removal System (FOD-VAC), will satisfy the U.S. Navys requirements by providing a highly capable debris removal system. Development and implementation of this innovative system will result in a significant improvement over current mechanical and manual equipment. The proposed system will deploy a novel probe designed to remove domestic FOD from AV-8B Harrier from within engine bay and aircraft compartments. In addition, a tracking system is proposed to aid personnel in ensuring FOD removal of flight line surfaces. Successful deployment of the FOD-VAC will provide effective debris removal, both on the flight line and within confined aircraft compartments, in turn preventing FOD damage and the cost of engine removal, repair, replacement, and downtime. Hy-Tek Manufacturing (HMC) believes that the deployment of the proposed FOD-VAC system in conjunction with an FOD Prevention Plan will result in a significant reduction of FOD related incidents."

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for technology and methodology to cost-effectively image through non-spherical infrared missile domes, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Digital Aberration Corrector for Aspheric Domes (DACFADO), utilizing an innovative combination of computational imaging algorithms based on Extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) theory of diffraction. These algorithms will work in a highly parallel manner on a modern graphics processing unit (GPU), enabling 30 fps real-time aberration correction. POCs innovation in computationally-assisted imaging will enable stationary and gimbaled infrared imaging missile seekers equipped with the DACFADO system to reliably image infrared radiation sources through a variety of aerodynamically optimized, non-spherical dome shapes. As a result, this technology offers a unique, highly adaptable infrared imaging capability, requiring only inexpensive, low size, weight, and power (SWaP) digital processing hardware, and enabling the use of low-drag domes in missiles, which directly addresses the Army requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the DACFADO system by developing a Technology Readiness Level (TRL)-3 prototype. In Phase II, POC plans to build a TRL-6 prototype implemented in a low SWaP processing hardware."

The system uses a fiber optic based, eye-safe wind LADAR, initially designed for UAV systems, brought to bread board level on Army and NASA programs. The system leans on existing telecom fiber technology allowing low cost and miniature sizing. The sensor features a coherent fiber optic transceiver with a narrow band seed, AOM (Acousto Optical Modulator) for frequency shift and pulse forming, a three stage EDFA amplifier, all operating at eye-safe 1550nm. The LADAR uses phase encoded pulse trains allowing a 13\/1 signal to noise improvement and 13x smaller range cells while preserving Doppler accuracy. This LADAR allows air current Doppler detection beyond 3km. The sensor output is Doppler shift in 3D pixels (voxels), 90 degree vertically 360 degrees horizontally, stabilized in global coordinates using a MEMs IMU\/GPS input, giving full ship area wind profiles. The original UAV specifications meet the system requirements, with additional range capability. Electronics, laser and receiver are in PCIe 104 format, meeting the objective size requirement. Global stabilized scan allows voxel scan revisit to allow 1ft\/sec velocity accuracy."

The technology will use a robotic platform for the placement of multiple sets of sensors that will automatically establish a communication network to deliver their signals to a remote ground station. The utilization of POCs proprietary laser technology to improve platform position tracking in GPS-denied environments will guarantee precise determination of sensor positions and corresponding accuracy when determining human locations. The use of numerous sensors utilizing various signals associated with the presence of humans will facilitate achieving the probability of human detection of &gt;50%. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the HDGL technology by modeling and simulating its operation, and experimentally demonstrating the operation of sensors and the accuracy of the platforms navigation at TRL-3. In Phase II, POC plans to develop the fully operational system prototype and demonstrate its performance in realistic environments (TRL-6)."

Proposes to develop and demonstrate to the Navy a miniature, light weight, and low power, fully integrated multi-channel hybrid PZT\/FBG acousto-ultrasound (FAULSense) SHM system for the in-situ un-attended detection, identification, and localization of structural damage in advance Navy structures. The distributed FAULSense system uses a network of PZT actuators for the controlled excitation of acoustic waveform signals and a distributed array of FBG acoustic-ultrasound sensors for the global detection and measurement of the excitation structure response. In Phase I, ROI will design, assemble, and produce a working prototype of the hybrid FAULSense early warning damage detection SHM system and test it on a simulated aircraft structure to demonstrate its ability to detect and localized hidden structural damage. In Phase II, ROI with the support of Sikorsky team, it will produce a stand-alone FAULSense system and tested in a relevant aircraft platform environment under a variety of passive and dynamic aerodynamic test conditions. All of the Navy current and future aircraft will benefit significantly from this project, wherein the key technological challenge is to develop methodologies for high fidelity detection and characterization of flaws and degradation in complex aerodynamic structures."

In Phase I, a prototype of the hybrid SHM system will be demonstrated to monitor actual environment loading history and track damage states (and evolution of such damage) on a metallic and composite coupon. The hardware\/software for data acquisition of the hybrid SHM system is proposed to be small\/lightweight, packaged as a single unit and eventually integrated with the current V-22 Vibration\/Structural Life and Engine Diagnostics (VSLED) system. An ultrasonic based wireless SHM system is proposed by ASC team to detect damages in structural components which can be easily integrated to current V-22s VSLED system. The proposed approach adds &quot;local&quot; damage discovery at the point and time of its inception by measuring changes in the character of ultrasonic waves; augments the &quot;global&quot; damage discovered from VSLED&apos;s vibration monitoring; is compatible with other software systems. Our plan for Phase II and commercialization of this approach will be further addressed."

Effective SHM systems must possess the ability to detect and track structural damage as well as monitor the actual environment and loading conditions the structure experiences. Current SHM systems utilize PZT actuators and fiber optic (FO) sensors separately to provide this information. In this program, Acellent Technologies Inc. in collaboration Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems Corporation (IFOS) proposes the development of an integrated system approach for a hybrid SHM system consisting of a hybrid PZTFO sensor network, monolithic connector for both sensor types, and data acquisition hardware\/software integrated into a single unit that will take advantage of any commonality in electronic components. The proposed hybrid Genielight system will be easy-to-install and use onboard an aircraft and will have a single low-weight, small form factor hybrid diagnostic hardware and software system. Phase I will focus on developing the system architecture and establishing feasibility. The program is fully supported by partners including - The Boeing Company and Bell Helicopter."

It is based on excitation of aircraft structures using piezoelectric (PZT) actuators and detection of the structural responses using novel fiber optic (FO) sensors. Specifically, the innovation in use of novel miniature PZT actuators, unique FO sensor designs, and a commercial modular signal-conditioner-based integrated data acquisition and control unit, will enable the HISIM to accurately detect structural damage. Therefore, this system offers high accuracy, broadband frequency response for detection of both static and dynamic structural response, no crosstalk between sensors, low signal attenuation for transmission across the entire platform, small size and weight, and no structural degradation after placement, which directly address the V-22 platform requirements for an integrated hybrid SHM system. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of HISIM by using a PZT\/FO sensor network to monitor loads and detect damage on simulated structural components, reaching TRL-3. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a complete hybrid SHM system prototype and demonstrate the system&apos;s structural monitoring capabilities on representative V-22 structural components, reaching TRL-4 to -5."

        "abstract": "Toyon Research Corp. proposes to develop neural-network-based algorithms for the autonomous control of a vehicle, to follow a leader vehicle driven by a human. Traditional methods are rule-based, requiring responses to be explicitly programmed for each state encountered by the vehicle. However, such methods perform poorly when the vehicle encounters a new state, a disadvantage our approach will address. Taking a deep learning approach, by training the neural networks with a large corpus of data, the follower vehicle will be able to learn to respond a wide range of scenarios, even those it has never encountered before. A combination of Convolutional and Recurrent neural network architectures is proposed, to combine the spatial feature extraction capability of the former, and the ability to learn long-term temporal relationships of the latter. To allow further training of the neural network, state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning algorithms will be investigated to allow unsupervised training of the networks. By allowing a limited degree of freedom to the follower vehicle, it can explore the environment and build further knowledge of the environment and the task, improving performance. Through the deployment of these algorithms on driving simulators, the neural networks can be trained for a large number of driving"

        "abstract": "There is growing interest in lithium ion aircraft batteries for military aircraft as a means to achieve substantial savings in weight and maintenance costs. However, the potential gains of lithium-ion battery technologies are largely limited due to safety hazards associated with the organic liquid electrolytes, which are flammable, volatile and corrosive. There is thus a significant need to develop lithium-ion capabilities without compromising safety for both military and civilian aircraft applications. Through the proposed research, Lionano will seek to develop a solid-state lithium ion battery to provide this capability. Lionano technology has the potential to greatly impact the military aviation sector, as well as the commercial aviation industry, through the development of a safe, light weight lithium-ion battery which increases operating ranges and decreases fuel costs."

In this SBIR project, by leveraging our recent investigations, Bioenno Tech proposes to develop a new ASSB based on a novel class of Li-S solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and the associated nanostructured electrodes with high specific capacities along with good ionic\/electronic conductivities. Using this class of electrolyte along with the associated cathode and anode that can be processed with a cost-effective, scalable route, the issues of electrolyte\/electrodes interfacial contact in the Li-S ASSB cell can be effectively addressed, leading to more desirable battery performance, including enhanced energy\/power densities, improved cyclability, excellent safety, and potentially low costs. Phase I will focus on the feasibility demonstration of proposed technology, through material design, processing, prototyping and characterizations. A full scale Li-S ASSB cell will be prototyped and demonstrated. In the subsequent Phase II, further optimization, scaling up and characterizations will be carried out for both material design\/processing, and the cell fabrication, which will pave the way to the successful development of a commercially viable Li-S ASSB product."

NanoCoatings, Inc.

By adjustment of MS-PVD parameters-tailored structures, such as dense for electrolyte and columnar for the intermediate functional layers fabricated with a novel glass-ceramic electrolyte, the mechanical integrity and required performance during ASSB cycling will be achieved. In the Phase I Base, separate anode and cathode structures with functional layers and solid-electrolyte layers will be fabricated for assembly into a battery cell. In the Phase I Option, a layer-by-layer complete battery cell will be fabricated by MS-PVD. SDSMT will fabricate the sputter targets for MS-PVD and perform detailed material and cell testing and evaluations which will include structural integrity (adhesion) and cell-performance evaluations, such as internal resistance, current-voltage behavior, discharge rate, and heat-generation. During the Phase I-Option NCI will develop a draft Materials and Process specification."

Recently, the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes has improved significantly. Current solid-state batteries however, still suffer from low power and short cycle life, especially at low temperatures, due to poor interfacial conductivity and stability between solid electrolytes and electrode materials. Lynntech proposes to develop a practical all solid-state (PASS) lithium-ion battery (LIB) based on the combination of core-shell electrode materials and high conductivity solid electrolytes to provide high energy and power, long cycle life, as well as functionality over a wide operating temperature range. During Phase I, Lynntech will develop advanced core-shell electrodes with highly conductive solid electrolytes, and evaluate the capacity, rate capability, cycle life, specific energy, and specific power of an all solid-state battery at the full cell level. A preliminary safety evaluation will also be performed. During Phase II, Lynntech will develop a prototype PASS LIB system to meet the Navys performance requirements. Lynntech will also perform a preliminary cost estimate for battery manufacturing and demonstrate the manufacturing feasibility."

Broadly, this project will open up an entirely new phase space for multiscale engineering of novel wire insulation materials with a wide range of applications in defense and commercial industry.

Carbon nanotube or graphene based materials and their composites with copper conductors are the most promising alternatives to achieve these objectives. While promising results have been shown with such materials in small lab scale samples, realizing this potential on practical scale wiring product has not been accomplished. The key roadblocks are the inefficient interface between the nanocarbon and the metal in the composite and practical bulk scale methods to address this problem. Lynntech proposes to develop graphene-copper composite conductor material with improved interface by addressing the fundamental limitations of the charge transfer process at the graphene-metal interface. In addition, Lynntech targets to develop scalable and economic approach for the composite fabrication process. The Phase I will provide feasibility to achieve &gt;25% improvements in mass specific conductivity over the metal conductor in a wide temperature range up to 150C by demonstrating the concept in a lab scale process.

        "abstract": "To develop, demonstrate, build and characterize several different gauge size cables which will be capable of increase current carrying capacity as compared to a standard copper electrical power cable of similar gauge size. These strands and cables will have the potential for significant weight and size reductions, as well as strength improvements for power cables across the military, industrial, and commercial markets. Electrical conductors are key components of just about every power device or system. However, increasing demands for power and data pushes the need for more capacity, and the total contribution of electrical conductor weight to the system has become significant in aircraft, ships, rail, automobiles and the warfighter. In this Phase I and eventual Phase II we propose the development for carbon nanotube (CNT) \/Cu current carrying composite cables, in terms of improving their electrical properties, thermal properties, and tensile properties. We will focus on CNT yarns that are plated with Cu and insulated; on the properties of conductivity, ampacity (maximum current which can be carried); thermal conductivity; and mass normalized values. These strands and cables will be insulated and characterized. It will also be necessary to consider other aspects, including strength, scalability, affordability, and manufacturing processes."

        "abstract": "In this SBIR Phase I project, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes to develop a flexible, lightweight, low cost, high electrical resistivity, abrasion resistant, erosion resistant, and wet-dielectric wire insulation for continuous operations at high temperatures exceeding 425C, for use in Navy aircraft applications. Continuous exposure of an engine wiring harness to harsh environmental conditions such as moisture, heat, vibration, and chemical contamination may result in insulation degradation and possible wire failure. Currently, glass fibers impregnated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are widely used for wire insulation. However, the relatively low upper temperatures of PTFE (260 C) limits its applicability for use at high temperature. In this SBIR proposal, ACT proposes to develop high performance wire insulations with specific advantages as listed below:Ability to handle high temperatures exceeding 425CDurable wet-dielectricHighly flexibleResistance is much larger than 100 Mega-ohmsHighly abrasion resistant Excellent erosion protectiveLightweightInexpensive"

        "abstract": "Actuation tuning and sensor calibration are essential procedures required to obtain expected and desired behavior from an optionally-manned platform. Unfortunately, these tasks often require custom and brittle procedures which are time consuming and difficult to conduct outside of a controlled environment with special-purpose test equipment. Furthermore, many of these procedures require routine re-tuning and re-calibration by dedicated personnel due to disturbances in sensor mounting locations, general wear on vehicle components, environmental variations, and replacement of parts due to failure or damage. To streamline the process of tuning and calibration, we propose a method of automatically determining actuation parameters, sensor calibration, and vehicle models. This effort will leverage our prior work on the ONR Code 30 Autonomy program, and in Phase I will focus on further developing the capability of automatic vehicle model parameter discovery, extending algorithms to support sensor self-calibration, and evaluating performance of the prototype in a benchtop environment with both simulated data and data from an unmanned ground vehicle. Upon demonstration of viability, in Phase II we plan to transition and optimize our process to run on-line, allowing for real-time adaptation of the models to changing vehicle and terrain conditions."

        "abstract": "Navy aircraft components require constant repair of minor nicks, dings, and dents due to damage from field operations. Although the damage appears to be minor, these components may no longer meet design specifications and need to be scrapped, increasing downtime of the asset. Thus, there is a critical need to develop a repair technology that will restore both the dimensions and the pre-damage strength of the component, particularly for Ti-6Al-4V components on the H-1 and other Light\/Attack Helicopters. Our novel solution is our handheld Compact Repair System (CRS). We have adapted a conventional solid state welding process currently used for large-scale manufacturing (conventional friction stir welding) and miniaturized the technology to facilitate the repair of minor damage. Our CRS is ideally suited to portable systems for the repair of minor damage. During the Phase I project, we will assemble the CRS, complete repair testing on relevant materials, design the prototype for aircraft repair, and demonstrate that the strength of the repaired parts (mechanical and fatigue) meet or exceed the baseline. During Phase II, we will complete the system design, fabrication, and testing and transition the technology to the Navy fleet."

Besides service induced damage, the components may also get damaged during maintenance, and\/or during component installation\/removal\/handling\/inspection.

However, this process has the drawback of leaving the repaired component with a lower thickness at the repair location which in turn reduces the ability for future repair as well as effect close tolerance component operation applications.

If approved, the Phase II project would address the implementation and testing of the conformance tool capabilities. Once implemented, this project would provide the basis for a HOST certification and accreditation authority for the administration of HOST standards, which will also allow significant improvements in the development and interoperability of modern, modular components. This initiative will evaluate the feasibility and define the requirements and architecture, which are necessary to develop the conformance tool. This conformance tool development will draw upon, and employ industry standard, state-of-the-art, engineering best practices. When completed, the tool will validate HOST-conformant COTS components (e.g. General Processing, I\/O Processing, Image Processing, Data Storage, and Power Supply architecture segments). HOST conformance test automation will result in a supply of robust components that will enhance current weapon systems longevity at reduced cost and implementation times."

        "abstract": "The Hardware Open Systems Technologies (HOST) standard exists to reduce the dependency of system implementations on the details of specific hardware choices, abstracting away these details behind a structured set of logical architecture and interfaces. Successfully configuring of a HOST chassis can be a complex task, requiring many decisions on logical configuration, hardware, interfaces, power systems, and physical layout, the result of which must satisfy many complex constraints. The target system supply sufficient hardware resources such as network\/communications, graphics, storage, etc. necessary to execute the application modules required. It must also obey power, thermal and performance requirements of the system, and be cost\/performance optimal to meet competitive pressures. We propose to develop a model-based systems engineering tool integration tool to assist the integrator in the development and configuration of HOST conformant systems. The tool will support high-level design capture of the system in a single, consistent model, with automated capabilities for analyzing and simulating performance, physical properties (power, thermal, etc) and synthesis to automate configuration of the target system. Design space exploration tools will assist in selecting the optimal set of HOST conformant components for the target system. Prototyping and stakeholder interaction are leveraged to guide feasibility and market alignment."

        "abstract": "We propose to develop an AM Process Parameter Optimizer (PPO) analytical package for AM process for a desired product performance stemming from mechanical and\/or functional requirement. Our proposed PPO tool will include an inner multi-scale, multi-physics thermo-mechanical engine, and an outer sensitivity and optimization layer to provide first order input design space for the AM machine settings instead of going through a series of iterations and checks. Furthermore, PPO takes the users desired mechanical and functional requirement for a selected Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process, and provides suggested input process variables and its spread for a particular machine.The key algorithmic developments in PPO are the sensitivity and optimization modules. These will be developed from a simulation based engineering design approach but accounting for inherent variability and uncertainty. TDAs thermomechanical model will also be enhanced in this effort to deal with simulation based design approach as proposed here. Design of Experiments will be carried out to study multiple input factors and their effect on desired output properties. TDAs research partner in this effort is Mississippi State University who will conduct the experiments based on DoE."

The optimization is based on the concept of design requirements and quality metrics for defect distribution, residual stress, dimensional tolerances, stress relief, solidification microstructure, solid state transformations and hot isostatic pressing. Each quality metric is defined in terms of measurable goals or tolerance bounds and the optimization procedure is organized to fulfill each quality metric using analytical modeling. The analytical toolset includes the simulation of melt pool physics, residual stresses, distortion and the modeling microstructure evolution. The variability of the DMLS process is captured using a combination of discrete particle model and melt pool physics simulation. Deposition trials will be performed in order to verify that the optimized parameters comply with each quality metric."

        "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing (AM) is of increasing interest for production of complex geometries and high-performance components for the DoD due to its advantage of design freedom and as-needed production capability. Components of interest to the Navy have a high standard in porosity, surface finish, mechanical properties and dimensional tolerance, etc. However, mechanical properties and part quality variability issues inherent to AM make rapid qualification of metal AM parts difficult. AM processes rely heavily on trial and error experiments for part qualification which is time and cost consuming, and without guarantee of optimized process parameters. 3DSIM is in the process of commercializing AM predictive modeling products capable of predicting thermal histories, residual stress, support structure design and part qualities such as porosity, surface finish, dimensional tolerance and distortion, etc. for metal AM processes. To address Phase I objectives, an analytical software toolset will be developed with integration of new AM part quality optimization algorithms which take into account one or several process parameters and intersection of others. 3DSIM proposes to add the capability of optimizing AM process parameters to enable rapid, low cost, high quality component qualification as the missing link for using predictive modeling in a streamlined qualification environment."

        "abstract": "This research considers innovative technologies to attack and defeat specialized targets and materiel within structures. The goal is to use high levels of explosive energy in the form of shaped charge warheads to generate high temperature environments, and to accelerate lethal fragments and jets against structures, to breach such structures and deposit lethal energy inside the interior against electronic components. To accomplish this goal, a combination of technologies is being utilized. The designs utilize shaped charges having unique liner geometries that breach structures and attack vulnerable components behind the structure. The approach takes advantage of energy release of reactive materials to deposit large amounts of energy against internal targets for their mitigation and destruction. The design incorporates a penetrating precursor warhead, and a secondary warhead so that multiple formed jets can produce dual material effects against the targets of interest. The attack mechanisms include reactive material fragmentation and reactive material liners producing shaped charge jets. This approach produces additional lethality against targets that are not only vulnerable to mechanical damage but thermal damage as well. The new warhead design has application as a new round capability for the MK19 grenade launcher system."

The payloads functionality can include passively gathering intelligence, such as audio or video sensors, or for Electronic Warfare (EW) via RF effects. Many adversarial industrial, civil, and communication infrastructures are vulnerable to electronic attack and cyber intrusion, but require close proximity in order to gain access. Munition delivery of EW NKEs allows them to be deployed very close to the target. This allows the EW to take place at lower RF power levels than it would for long range attacks. This limits the sphere of influence of the device and reduces any unattended consequences to the localized area. Toyon will utilize its experience developing munition electronics and custom RF hardware and antennas to create a prototype EW NKE submunition targeting a 155 mm projectile."

        "abstract": "Currently available supercapacitors offer relatively low energy densities compared to other energy storage devices. One strategy to improve this situation is to use liquid electrolytes with wider electrochemical windows, high ionic conductivities, low viscosities, and low melting points that can function over a broad temperature range.Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) have recently been identified as a new class of ionic liquids and a potential alternative to the aqueous and organic based solvent electrolytes that are currently being used in supercapacitors. DESs are easily synthesized by simply mixing two or more inexpensive raw materials. We propose an innovative discovery and design approach for novel DESs that can be used as electrolytes in military grade supercapacitor applications. Our team will create a discovery pipeline that is built around an informatics-driven, rational research paradigm, and that will tightly couple computational (i.e., first-principles modeling, virtual high-throughput screening, big data analytics, materials informatics) and experimental (i.e., synthesis, characterization) research thrusts. This coordinated research platform will provide an interactive, real-time feedback loop, which will significantly enhance the overall development process. It allow us to rapidly and efficiently explore chemical space, gain insights into relevant structure-property relationships, and identify promising, high-value lead candidates."

        "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) poses a growing threat to our national security. Commercially available UASs can now carry explosives, and perform electronic surveillance missions with an increasing range against our military, cities, infrastructure, population and information. Swarm attacks are possible by automated drones and dirty bombs can be dropped in populated areas.Due to the ease of small UAS acquisition and modifications, it is inevitable that future attacks will be carried out by small UASs. A low SWAP-C system to search, detect, identity, track and determine intend (SDITI) of this growing threat is now necessary. We propose a low SWAP-C, man portable fusion approach leveraging the benefits of passive radar, image processing, particle filter tracking and deep learning to maximize SDITI performance and provide a comprehensive solution. In addition, multi-spectral analysis techniques will be incorporated to provide radio frequency characteristics of the UAS and controller. The fusion solution can then be used for intent and threat level assessment and to craft an effective countermeasure. We have successfully applied the above techniques individually for detection, tracking and classification on other programs and are confident that a fusion approach will provide the best low SWAP-C solution to performing SDITI against hostile UASs."

The goal of this effort is to evaluate the performance of multiple spin compensation methods and determine the optimal parameters for each concept to mitigate the penetration reduction due to angular momentum over a broad range of spin rates.Concepts that broaden the effective range over which the spin compensation of the munition is effective will be pursued to further maximize their performance. Corvid will achieve this through a high fidelity computational physics led design and optimization process exploring a number of spin compensation concepts\/techniques.Top performing concepts will be down-selected for prototype fabrication and testing in Phase II to support implementation into a tactical configuration."

The proposed soft recovery system will enable the ammunition RDT&amp;E community to expose developmental precision munition components to actual gun launch conditions.Components to be tested are mounted in their operational location on a specially designed 155mm projectile which is fired from a howitzer in a nearly vertical orientation.The soft recovery system deploys while the projectile is in flight and safely lands the components for post-test evaluation.The proposed system will shorten the development time of advanced munition components and substantially reduce the cost of development."

Nokomis will leverage its expertise in detecting, identifying, locating, and disrupting electronic subsystems including triggering devices using radio frequency (RF) emissions which has resulted in a deep knowledge base to realize solutions to mitigating mines and IEDs through a feasibility study detailing solution requirements and Concepts of Operation (CONOPS). Nokomis has developed relevant systems to detect the unintended RF emissions of electronics components used as trigger devices, control subsystems, or system payloads, gaining a thorough understanding of the characteristics of these targets as well as the exploitable content of their emissions. The approach of detecting threats through electromagnetic emissions from the threat subsystems (particularly the trigger and control components) and using electromagnetic energy to disable the electronic components has been successful at IED and EO\/IR sensor detection, which has been demonstrated at stand-off distances up to 15km or more and can counter a variety of threats and will be successfully leveraged to detect anti-helicopter mines."

To address these challenges, we propose to design and evaluate Fast Image Enhancement via Real-time Encoding (FIERCE), an image enhancement methodology that leverages robust image processing techniques and convex optimization to produce augmented imagery designed specifically so that Warfighters can safely navigate at a minimum speed of 10 m.p.h. through HDVEs."

Nu-Treks digital bolometer features a digital pixel and alternative architecture that enables full frame integration and read out, low noise, large formats, and fast frame rates. The enabling innovation is a mixed mode readout integrated circuit (ROIC) architecture, implemented by 3D wafer integration. A key element of our commercialization strategy is the exploitation of expanded dual use opportunities which will be enhanced through the cost\/performance attributes of our unique digital ROIC and the FPAs produced. The performance improvements will further open the application space for uncooled sensors. Nu-Trek will identify transition partners that will assure this enabling technology is made available for both commercial as well as military applications. The further development of uncooled FPAs through the development of this digital ROIC will expand the use of IR uncooled FPAs in key military as well as commercial markets. Targeted military markets due to the SWAP advantages of uncooled FPAs, will be for persistent surveillance applications, especially for small miniaturized drones, distributed aperture sensors and high definition sensors. Targeted commercial applications will be for surveillance and security installations."

In order to facilitate clock and receiver integration at a deep coupling level, CHARM uses a stable external oscillator to drive the receivers front-end. GPS measurements are then applied for clock calibration, while clock aiding is exploited to improve robustness of GPS signal and measurement processing. GPS integrity monitoring is implemented to mitigate the influence of measurement outliers on position and timing solution. Two key components of the proposed technical approach include: (i) exploitation of sub-centimeter precise GPS carrier phase measurements for clock calibration and integrity monitoring, and (ii) clock aiding for long coherent integration of GPS signals. The mechanization of CHARM will be developed and prototyped using software-defined radio capabilities that have been implemented jointly with Northrop Grumman Corporation. Phase I effort will fully develop the CHARM system mechanization and will demonstrate its technological feasibility using simulated and experimental data."

They must monitor data from diverse sources, repeatedly circling back for updates, always evaluating content, and aiming to identify critically relevant information when it is first available. These are painstaking processes. The cost of missing critical information is high. To reduce this burden, we propose ALFRED (Analytic for Federated Data) THE BUTLER (Tool for Human Efficiency: Behavior and Updates Tracker for Learning Expectations and Relevance). This tool minimizes the burdens of information-search and information-evaluation encountered by intelligence analysts. ALFRED THE BUTLER monitors a centralized cloud-based database and the users activities to (a) learn work patterns and data-related expectations; (b) anticipate operators information needs through learned definitions of operational-relevance and workflow state; and (c) discretely prioritize and format operator-facing messages to optimize impact and minimize disruption. As a result, ALFRED THE BUTLER facilitates the warfighters timely recognition of situationally-relevant details and activities to preempt threats and prevent casualties from asymmetric war."

Even though tremendous advancements have been developed over the last decade, significant gaps remain in replicating the in vivo scenario. A key bottleneck, of particular relevance to thick tissues is the mass transfer limitations across the vasculature to the tissue cells, which detrimentally impacts the long term viability and functionality of the tissue constructs.In this context, we propose to develop (design, fabricate, test, and demonstrate) a novel platform for generation of vascularized thick tissue constructs that mimick the desired cell, tissue and organ architecture. During Phase I, we will demonstrate proof-of-concept using a synergistic in silico and in vitro approach to guide the development of the thick vascularized tissues. Both viability and biomarker analysis will be performed to demonstrate viable tissues. In Phase II, we will further characterize the tissue constructs by functional assays and long term maintenance. The developed constructs will be validated against in vivo data for both structural and functional responses. Finally, we will expand the system to mimic additional organs of interest. Process of FDA clearance will be initiated."

Commercially, modest improvements in water and energy efficiency have been made in recent years, but at a sacrifice in their ability to clean and sanitize field laundry to acceptable levels. Expending additional efforts to further improve this type of equipment must therefore be questioned.This SBIR Phase I project seeks to make a quantum leap in water and energy reduction by developing a laundry system utilizing CO2 dry cleaning.This will include harnessing carbon dioxide (CO2) from sources available in theater, or if necessary generating CO2.Since both CO2 dry cleaning and CO2 recovery technologies are a known art, Guild Associates believes we have the understanding and experience to transition these technologies into deployable systems capable of meeting the climatic, transportability, and interoperability requirements needed to support the Force Provider, Medical Corps, and Quartermaster missions."

When used in parachute cords, the material will function as a low-profile strain sensor, while still providing the mechanical strength demonstrated by commericially available nylon yarns. Because the yarn will not have significant increase in weight and volume, relative to commercially available nylon yarn, the sensor will not adversely effect parachute function, nor require modification of packing or deployment procedures. This will allow the yarn to replace one of the core yarns in parachute cord, and provide sensing capability for laboratory and fielded parachute deployments and flights."

        "abstract": "In this proposal, several novel concepts are presented that have the objective of extending the mortar range while increasing its lethality. With the proposed concepts, the mortar range is to be increased by reducing the total mass of the shell, reducing the friction forces acting on the shell in the launch tube, and by reducing aerodynamic drag forces during the flight. The mortar precision is to be increased inducing spinning through aerodynamic forces without generating any additional drag. The proposed novel composite structure concepts would not only reduce the shell weight but would also allow for aerodynamic formed fragmentation upon detonation to significantly increase lethality. The proposed composite shell structure design also provides the capability of integrating many of the mortar components into the shell structure, such as the proposed very low power actuation devices for terminal guidance or other similar course correction actions to increase lethality. As a result, the space available inside the mortar shell for explosive charges and other components is increased, thereby providing another means of increasing lethality."

How do you integrate multimaterials into a production line that requires different feedstock formatsinks, pastes, filaments, pellets and powders and process to fabricate a fully functional munition Logistics of the design, fabrication process and materials. Market drivers of each element of the infrastructure needs to be assessed. Data management and cybersecurity of design and fabrication files will be assessed. All digital controlled processes will be evaluated.This effort will identify the what is state and compare to the desired future state generating a gap analysis in order to identify the missing hard parts and focus attention to these identified elements. The result is a recommended pilot line for printing 40mm munitions. The journey is long but it has begun and the opportunity that this program presents will change how the future of munitions will be manufactured."

        "abstract": "Due to their unstable chemical nature, ordnance propellants have limited shelf life. Disposal of expired propellants has been a highly visible problem recently, as exemplified by the large stockpile (over 16 million pounds) of unstable M6 Propellant discovered in 2012 at Camp Minden near Minden, LA.This stockpile is currently in the final stages of controlled, closed-burn disposal; however, conversion of this large quantity of propellant to salable biofuels and\/or bioproducts would have provided much more value to the Army.More broadly, the availability of an established technology for end-of-life conversion of propellants to valuable biofuels\/bioproducts would enhance the logistics workflow of the Army, as the material would become a process feedstock rather than a waste stream for disposal. In this SBIR program, Faraday and Ohio University will investigate the feasibility of pulsed FARADAYIC ElectroCatalysis for the conversion of the major components of M6 Propellant to biofuels\/bioproducts. In particular, electrochemical depolymerization and denitration of the major nitrocellulose component and denitration of the minor dinitrotoluene component will be examined. Both processes have been studied in industrial and academic contexts, but an economical processing route is not currently available on a relevant scale."

        "abstract": "At the US Armys bases access to freshwater is vital, yet it often comes with a high price tag.Water supply and disposal poses a logistical challenge, and often involves costly trucking.To avoid such costs, the US Army would like to recycle as much wastewater as possible at its bases, including its smaller and more remote operations. For this reason, the US Army is interested in a wastewater classification device (WWCD) that can assist in proper wastewater management and reuse. We propose to develop a real-time WWCD that would automatically classify both treated and untreated wastewater to assist the US Army in meeting its wastewater management objectives.The sensors we propose to use will be field-deployable, robust, and inexpensive.However, they will also be inherently noisy, especially when compared to standard laboratory measurements.Our WWCD will conduct innovative point-of-device analytics to make accurate classifications, despite being given very noisy data.We will use a novel combination of techniques in machine learning, optimal decision theory, and principles of wastewater treatment to develop a classification algorithm for our WWCD, which can provide results in real-time and for a fraction of the costs associated with laboratory methods."

However, in order to maximize the amount of water that is recycled at an Army base, an intelligent water monitoring system is needed to ensure that water from various sources on the base is processed appropriately. Mainstream Engineering proposes to develop a chemometric model to fully describe and characterize water prior to recycling or disposal. This technology relies upon statistical methods that relate data to properties of interest. In Phase I, Mainstream will optimize the chemometric model for a variety of waste water sources including laundry, kitchen, shower and latrine. In Phase II, Mainstream will fabricate and test the monitoring system. This will ultimately result in a prototype delivered to the Army for testing within a relevant operational environment (TRL 6)."

The Army has portable seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination systems, however they are bulky, truck portable, energy expensive, and too large a scale for small unit level or the individual soldier.There is a need for a small scale, man-portableSWRO units. One impediment to creating this is the energy demands for SWRO systems. Large scale systems have developed energy recovery devices to reclaim the energy in the SWRO waste, these systems do not scale down to a man portable unit. This proposal outlines an innovative method to recover the SWRO waste energy, keep the system small and light, and allow flexibility for a wide range of water conditions and outputs. Using lightweight materials and nano-composite thin film coatings to both lubricate and protect the system from high salinities we propose a small energy recovery device.The system is driven by wastewater and input seawater pressurized to RO levels with a motor that supplies the necessary power above what is recovered. The system size and weight allows for development of a man portable, adaptable, desalinization system."

In addition, for platforms that require stringent RCS signature control, EO\/IR sensors require to be placed behind RCS-complaint optical windows. Such platforms include Navy stealth ships EO\/IR windows, fixed and rotary wing aircrafts EO\/IR apertures, missile dome, and directed energy weapon apertures. Additional requirements include multi waveband operation and high optical transparency from visible to the IR. Current microwave absorbers are either made of optically opaque materials or require a metallic ground plane and thus are not transparent in the optical regime.We will design, fabricate and test a novel optically transparent microwave absorber based on doped monolayer and\/or multi-layer graphene. Our technical approach can be tailored to meet specific optical and microwave requirements by design and\/or chemically controlling the conductivity by doping. Graphenes conductivity can be voltage-controlled given the possibility for dynamically tunable microwave absorbers. Graphene sheets can be fabricated over large areas making it possible to develop transparent microwave absorbers for large optically transparent window applications for many different military platforms."

The MICOR will implement a unique kinoform corrector plate in front of the focal plane, enabling complete correction for dome distortion even on gimbaled systems. The MICOR will be fabricated separately for each wavelength range, and will be positioned between the imaging optics and the focal plane. During Phase I we will design the kinoform, perform necessary system trade-offs, and demonstrate the corrector plate improving the image through a sample dome. At the end of Phase I the MICOR will reach technology readiness level (TRL) 3-4. In Phase II we plan to develop the kinoform into a preproduction TRL 6 prototype, designed for a single missile-dome combination."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for a squad level system to detect and counter unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Portable Anti-UAS Device (PAN-UAS). The system is based on a new design that combines state-of-the-art airspace monitoring technology with novel UAS countermeasure approaches packaged into a man-packable system. Specifically, the innovation in miniaturizing and ruggedizing radar detection and radio frequency (RF) jamming systems will enable the PAN-UAS system to detect and counter both individual and swarms of UASs while being self-contained in a very portable form factor. As a result, this system offers a tactical, ruggedized solution that is less than 100 in.^3, less than 3 lb, and costs less than $15k, which is appropriate for squad and platoon level operation and directly addresses the Army requirements. In Phase I, POC will theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of PAN-UAS by performing four focused trade studies coupled with select feasibility testing to reach technology readiness level (TRL)-3. In Phase II, POC plans to refine the system design and produce a fully-integrated prototype to use for live demonstration against a UAS, reaching TRL-6."

        "abstract": "UtopiaCompression proposes novel machine learning based multi-scale detection algorithm coupled with a novel tracking approach using a Track Before Detect (TBD) paradigm to address the problem of problem of detecting and tracking small Unmanned Aircraft System and Mortars in a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).Small UAS platforms are smaller in size, fly at lower altitudes and are slower in speed when compared to other larger air traffic. Mortars, on the other hand, move in a predictable manner, but have low SNR and small size that makes them harder to detect and track, especially against cluttered background. During Phase I, we will conduct requirements analysis to identify an appropriate Medium Wave Infrared imaging system and a suitable compute platform to support the requested data rates.We will leverage our experience in developing systems for UAS detect and avoid applications to provide a computationally feasible solution to the problem at hand. We will demonstrate the feasibility using modeling and simulation methods and by conducting our own data collection experiments. Finally, we will analyze the computational performance of our algorithm and direct our efforts in identifying suitable platforms to enable real-time detection and tracking of multiple targets in low SNR and cluttered environments."

The maximum range of passive thermal infrared sensors (MWIR\/LWIR) is reduced when targets are small (sub-pixel), low-SNR, or imaged against high-clutter backgrounds. Aret Associates proposes to leverage its demonstrated expertise in real-time, physics-based image processing and statistical faint-target tracking to improve detection and tracking of low-contrast, pixel- and sub-pixel sized targets in multi-frame MWIR imagery. In this Phase-I effort, Aret will develop and demonstrate hardware-optimized pre-processing, image enhancement, and target detection and tracking. The tracker will ultimately be deployed on custom hardware, and operate real-time on 300+ Hz-frame rate MWIR imagery. This will meet the objective of reducing the minimum detection and tracking range for small UAVs and mortars."

Orbital IVT is a novel automotive transmission design that harnesses the power from the centrifugal force of rotating eccentric masses to create the first Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT) capable of scaling to large vehicle sizes. The unique design combines the high mechanical efficiency of fixed gear ratio transmissions with the high engine efficiency obtained using a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) in a lightweight, rugged, and high-torque package.The simple, high-efficiency design of the Lestran Orbital IVT allows the components to be sized for greater endurance and higher power while remaining smaller than competing designs. The high mechanical efficiency of the Orbital IVT eliminates hydraulic fluids and costly lubrication and cooling methods resulting in a dramatically higher maintainability and lower operating cost. The small number of parts and the straightforward parts design drive reduced manufacturing costs in both material and labor and increase reliability.The Phase I project will develop a preliminary design for a target military vehicle, validate existing physics based models, and take test data to verify major performance and efficiency claims."

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for mechanisms to make ground vehicle armor more adaptive and better defeat threats, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Linear Armor Positioner and Damper (LAPD).The key innovation comes from the arrangement and design of the positioning mechanism to take advantage of the damping characteristics of pneumatic\/hydraulic linear actuators during a ballistic shock event.Specifically, the mechanism design reduces the severity of shock events caused by enemy weaponry through the gas\/liquid compression in a linear actuator and by increasing the distance these shock events occur from the vehicle interior.As a result, LAPD meets the Army need for adaptive mechanisms to better defeat threats without imposing the significant weight burdens adding armor causes.In Phase I, POC will research and develop the LAPD design, performing stress, thermal, and fatigue analyses.In Phase II, a fully functional LAPD prototype will be manufactured and tested to a subset of applicable tests in Army specification ATDP-2404 such as transport and ground vehicle vibration and cycling, and delivered to the Army."

The in-line monitoring system designed by our team is based on scattering and imaging methods, and can detect particulate matter and condensed water in the fuel. We propose a refinement of this system to improve detection and sizing reliability, as well as reduce the overall dimension and power consumption of the instrument. This proposal aims at investigating new imaging methodologies to extend the detection capabilities of the instrument under different particle types. Improvements in image processing routines are also planned to take advantage of the new imaging capabilities. As part of the feasibility study, experiments will be carried out to confirm the scattering calculations and assumptions necessary to extract fuel contaminants concentrations. Optional tasks include integrating the scattering methods with the imaging size distribution information toward more accurate concentration measurement and evaluating the potential of a capacitance probe to detect large water presence in the fuel stream."

        "abstract": "The objective of the work detailed in this proposal is to demonstrate feasibility of using a portable, dynamic imaging device to detect solids and water contamination in military grade fuels near points of transfer from storage to vehicle. The consequences of contaminated fuel are well known and include clogging of filters, freezing of fuel lines, growth of microbials within the fuel system and the loss of vehicle performance capability. Visual capability allows the instrument to not only measure size and count of particles, but also enables them to be classified according to their shape which allows for the determination of water and gas droplets separate from solids in a fluid stream. The ability of a single instrument to detect and classify the existence of both within fuel streams as they flow can protect poor quality fuel from being transferred into vehicles. This proposal seeks to test the feasibility of the instrument in the field between the pump and fill nozzle. It also will present concepts to miniaturize the instrument to a portable size and weight and to provide a quick connect logic to allow fast hook up and detachment from the fuel line preferably without the use of tools."

Current laser target boards that measure laser power, divergence, and pointing accuracy are not rapidly deployable and easily transported throughout open-air military ranges. Technology Service Corporation (TSC) will leverage its twenty-plus years of experience in developing and fielding infrared test equipment used at open-air ranges for Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) of Missile Warning and Directional Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM) systems to develop the Laser Target and Analysis Board (LTAB) system. In the Phase I Base program, TSC will first define the LTAB system requirements, then generate design options and evaluate them through various trade studies including cost versus performance. TSC will then develop a candidate LTAB system, and a plan to implement and demonstrate a pre-production prototype in Phase II. In the Phase I Option program, TSC will continue the development of the prototype system design, and investigate designs for measurement capabilities of additional military lasers."

These communication links provide information to the interceptor in flight such as guidance, target type, and other quintessential data required for intercepting the target. Legacy data links utilize modulation techniques such as Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) to communicate information from the ground to the missile platform. Newer systems require more complex information and are achieving higher data rates through Frequency and Phase Shift Keying (FSK and PSK) techniques. With the advent of common launcher systems for both legacy and evolving missiles technologies, the need for a reprogrammable data link system exists. This proposal addresses this need and provides a potential solution."

Additionally, cyber security is a key driver in the challenge of managing COTS obsolescence due to the threat that unsupported hardware and software poses to Navy networks. The overall Innovative Defense Technologies (IDT) proposed solution is to provide a highly scalable and adaptable solution, suitable for use across an enterprise, which organizes the highly complex and disparate data sources associated with COTS obsolescence into a decision-making construct."

The goal of cyber resiliency frameworks that support mission-critical systems are to minimize the time spent recovering and restoring a system from a cyber-attack and to maximize the time spent with full mission capabilities. In order to successfully endure, recover, and restore the system when faced with a cyber-attack, it is critical to have access to mission capability metrics as well as intimate awareness of the underlying system dependencies. IDTs experience developing a virtualized AEGIS Weapons System has resulted in key insights into how a virtual combat system can take advantage of innovative virtualization concepts and still maintain the integrity of mission-critical capabilities. The robust technology provided by IDTs ATRT suite of test and analysis tools will be a springboard for taking our innovative virtualization concepts, like Revolving Defense Attack Surface (RDAS), and wrapping that capability with Real-Time Risk Assessment (RRA) to deliver cyber resiliency enhancements that are tailored to the needs of a high-availability, mission-critical system."

        "abstract": "In a multi-static drifting field of active and passive sonobuoys, reducing the area of uncertainty (AOU) around a submarine target is of paramount importance, especially when operating in Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2AD) environments. In order to take advantage of all available information, we use a joint estimation approach that simultaneously estimates all buoy states (position and velocity) and covariances, as well as multiple target states. In a three-dimensional buoy field with 20 to 40 buoys, this means that the joint state vector (and corresponding covariances) are very large. The off-block diagonal portions of the joint covariance matrix contains information that couples estimates between the individual buoy states, as well as the submarine target state. Ignoring the cross coupling simply throws away information that can be used to reduce the AOU of the target. We plan a stepped approach that integrates joint buoy and target estimation with a multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm. Our overall objective is to reduce the AOU of the submarine, which ultimately reduces the prosecution time line."
