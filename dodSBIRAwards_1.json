        "abstract": "The Navy has challenged the Small Business community to develop an improved skirt system for air cushion vehicles which reduces total ownership cost by increasing product life, decreasing manufacturing costs as well as installation and maintenance time, and improving reparability. The current system is primarily comprised of vulcanized polychloroprene rubber bonded to chemically coated nylon fabric, which is costly to produce and has limited design options to add additional features for attachment points and additional reinforcements. Materials Sciences Corporation proposes to focus on coating methods using low viscosity, two-part polyurethane resins capable of encapsulating and bonding through a wide variety of textile reinforcements. MSC will use a versatile polymer coating system which opens the possibility of many potential reinforcement materials and forms. MSC has previously demonstrated these coating techniques to form tough but flexible products with strength and abrasion characteristics comparable to thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) coated textiles but with simpler application and more design flexibility. MSC will perform fabrication and testing of various material combinations to compare performance to the legacy material system."

Current parachute systems function well and meet the performance needed for most DoD missions; however, the Marines need a HALO parachute which weighs less, packs in a smaller volume, has a larger glide ratio, and is more maneuverable for critical assignments. The Marines will benefit from a single surface HALO parachute for personnel, payloads, and eventually drones which can drop needed supplies to Marines in remote locations. Some of these applications are one time use parachutes and others need to have a comparable lifecycle to traditional parachutes.This SBIR presents DAngelo Technologies, LLC with the technical opportunity to design and demonstrate a High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) parachute with a single surface canopy design that provides the required lift capability and survives canopy opening by leveraging high strength bonded nonwoven fabrics."

SDAT will integrate three-dimensional (3D) ship and vehicle data, enable users to place and visualize vehicles and their path within ship vehicle stowage spaces and on ramps, enable collision detection based on a user-defined clearance, assess physical fit and loading paths, take measurements, and visualize emplacement of vehicle restraints in a 3D virtual environment. The Design Mill Team (DM) will develop SDAT to accurately render surfaces in sufficient detail to enable analysis and valid conclusions by Program Office and Test organizations regarding transportability. Given a significant volume of 3D data and varied sources, integration of the data is a unique challenge the Team will overcome, as will be the ability to detect collisions. DM will incorporate unique processes to overcome these challenges. Further, DM will define error introduced and propagated in processing for simulation and incorporate it in terms of confidence bounds, i.e. a margin and corresponding degree of confidence that collisions will not occur. Finally, and importantly, commercialization focus will be on warehousing and industrial markets, and on aviation and maritime cargo shipping to optimize load planning and stowage."

        "abstract": "To address the Marine Corps need, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Assistive Compact Convolutional Enhanced Neural Targeting (ACCENT) system based on a new design using convolutional neural network (CNN) software implemented on embedded hardware for assisted target recognition and laser pointing. Specifically, the innovation in image processing algorithms and automatic target designation can be implemented onboard the Future Targeting System (FTS) using a modular, open architecture. As a result, the ACCENT system addresses the fundamental problem of aiding the operator by reducing cognitive load given relatively lower-quality input day and night imagery. This enables the potential weight reduction of FTS by reducing optical design requirements, which directly address Marine Corps requirements. The computationally efficient architecture reduces time to provide feedback thus reducing operator exposure. In Phase I, POC plans to develop concepts for enhancing target detection, identification, recognition, and location capabilities of the FTS. We will perform analysis to show improvements, provide a description of the processing needed, and the development approach to making a prototype system. In Phase II, we will develop a scaled evaluation prototype based on the Phase I results, Phase II performance goals, and Marine Corps requirements for enhanced processing capabilities."

        "abstract": "Modern DoD applications are benefiting from the proliferation of EO\/IR sensor technology. As imagers become cheaper and smaller, they are being more widely deployed for a variety of scenarios. This trend is exemplified by the Navys Future Targeting System (FTS), which will provide laser designation, laser spot imaging, and some target location functions in a single 5.5-pound unit, replacing discrete laser designators (28 pounds) and laser spot imagers (7 pounds). This new system will offer a single compact system for performing rapid target acquisition, laser terminal guidance operations, and laser spot imaging to USMC troops responsible for supporting arms observers, spotters, and controllers. However, a significant burden is still placed on the operator. In this project, we will develop image processing technology to improve operator effectiveness by enhancing the imagery collected by the FTS and other similar sensors, as well as integrate automated techniques for detecting and classifying objects of interest in the collected video streams."

Intelligent use of this hardware and the data it provides can further reduce the size and weight of the system while improving performance. Image stabilization, automatic target recognition, target cuing, visible\/thermal image fusion, automatic pointing and firing of the laser range finder and automatic target location have the potential to improve overall system effectiveness and permit reduced optics sizes and weight. The addition of target tracking would apply all of these improvements to moving targets. Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) together with AAI Corporation, d\/b\/a Textron Systems, Unmanned Systems (AAI) propose to develop and demonstrate these innovative technologies by leveraging substantial past experience in the development of sophisticated computer vision algorithms as well as miniature, agile, laser steering subsystems for handheld operations. The key innovation of the proposed approach is a flexible architecture using demonstrated technologies (TRL 6) that will allow the evaluation and validation of different approaches.

        "abstract": "Rigid wall shelter protection against electromagnetic threats has historically been provided by passive steel or aluminum skins on the shelter walls. However, these legacy shelters require high levels of maintenance and corrosion protection; do not meet current International Standards Organization (ISO) and Convention of Safe Container (CSC) standards for stack height; are not energy efficient and are heavy to transport; and do not meet increasing electromagnetic inferfernce (EMI) requirements. There is thus a need for a next-generation rigid wall shelter design that provides better EMI shielding effectiveness; lower weight; has improved structural capability for stacking requirements; offers better energy efficiency (insulation); increases shelter lifespan; and is competitive in cost. The Luna team proposes to develop a next-generation 10-foot ISO and CSC compliant EMI shielding composite rigid wall shelter (CRWS) that utilizes a mechanically robust and lightweight composite panel design. Phase I feasibility demonstration will focus on composite coupon fabrication and characterization, as well as early prototype enclosure design mechanical and thermal simulations. A simplified 10-foot ISO non-expandable CRWS prototype will be fabricated in the Phase II for comprehensive performance testing and manufacturability assessment."

To achieve TRL 4 in Phase I, the SDC team will identify the proper materials for wall construction and assembly gasketing. The material selection will be validated via structural design and analysis, as well as material testing for mechanical properties and EMI shielding. SDC will construct subscale shelters that will be both EMI and mechanically tested to complete the proof-of-concept within the Phase I program."

There are several key operational deficiencies with metal RWS, the weight of legacy systems and lack of insulation result in a high cost to transport and difficulty heating and cooling interior spaces, respectively. In response to these challenges, a concerted effort by Core Composites has been place on developing a new class of Composite RWS (CRWS) using composite construction methods. The next step in their evolution is to provide electromagnetic shielding against a full spectrum of operational threats. Conductive Composites Company (CCC) mitigates these issues through a unique shielding composite materials based on Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of nickel on a variety of material substrates. The knowledge gained by Core Composites efforts, and our own, will be directly applicable to the new EMI CRWS. We will combine CCC materials and Cores multi-side infusion technique to deliver an EMI RWS that meets the stated requirements."

The INSURD is a unique integration of baseband RF transceiver with software tunable up\/down-converter module and application specific, proprietary adaptive beamforming (AB) algorithm, dynamically controlling an ultra-wide band Rotman Lens antenna array with MIMO architecture. The INSURDs suite of precision RF, environmental and navigational sensors, and built-in classification and adaptation functions detect the localized ambient RF noise floor and ensure undetectability of the networked radios at =10 km range. Operating on HiMARS-bound wireless network, INSURD enables duplex broadband communication of up to 8 transceivers with integrated Type 1 encryption headers. In Phase I, POC will develop the man-packable and vehicle-mounted INSURD concept. Simulation results and hardware testing of communication performance will lead to a Phase II development plan. We anticipate that at the end of Phase II, six INSURD prototypes will be ready for initial testing by the Marine Corps."

        "abstract": "One of the largest threats to multi-level secure operating systems are zero-day privilege escalation attacks that allow an adversary to gain root privileges and break out of any sandbox environment. To combat these challenges RAM Laboratories is proposing a secure dual-classification operating system with kernel integrity modules that prevent this style of attacks. First, instead of simultaneously running two classification levels in virtual environments, we have two versions of the operating system installed on the device, each encrypted with separate keys. This means that an adversary, at any privilege level, will be unable to gain access to the other classification level, as the proper key would be needed to decrypt and access the other classification level. However, even if an adversary cannot access the other classification level, we still want to prevent them from gaining root privileges at all. To this end, we use the ARM TrustZone to enforce kernel integrity, with modules executing in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) offering a much smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) than typical hypervisors or full-fledged kernels. By enforcing a few security properties, the modules are able to prevent any adversary from executing user-space code with kernel privileges, preventing any privilege escalation attack."

        "abstract": "To meet the Marine Corps&apos; need for data integrity, resilience, confidentiality, and multi-level security on hand-held devices, portable computers, and tactical servers, Grier Forensics proposes development and demonstration of Trapeze. Trapeze achieves high protection multi-level security by booting into one of a number of distinct, isolated Security Environments. Security Environments are selected at boot time and then fixed until reboot, enabling true multi-level security. Crucially, Security Environments never contain any operating system critical files. Instead, all critical files reside exclusively in a dedicated Tamper Proof Container (TPC), external to the Security Environments, which is loaded into the environment on boot. Data stored within the TPC can never be modified by any user or application, even in the presence of zero-day vulnerabilities or user privilege escalation. Trapeze uses mechanisms (including SRSS and HOLMES) to enforce data integrity; detect, block, and report any attempts to modify protected files; rapidly restore to a known good configuration; and ensure multi-level security. Using a novel architecture, Trapeze is able to achieve these protections with remarkable high performance and low overhead, including low CPU, RAM, and storage impact. Grier Forensics is experienced in development of similar technologies, and will deliver a high-performance, high-protection solution."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a radar and electro-optical\/infrared (EO\/IR) fusion system running on space, weight and power (SWaP) constrained platforms for ship classification and identification, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Binarized Deep Fusion Classification (BDFC) technology. This proposed BDFC solution is based on decision-level and feature-level data fusion of multiple sensory modalities using artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers. Imaging modalities are classified by the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A policy network fuses the output of the individual classifiers and metadata to make the final decision. BDFC utilizes innovative ANN binarization to facilitate its real-time implementation on mobile computing devices and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). As a result, BDFC offers rapid sensor fusion on low-SWaP platforms for high-confidence target classification, which directly addresses the PMA-299 requirements. In Phase I, POC will reach TRL-3 by training and testing the model on synthetic datasets to demonstrate the enhanced classification accuracy by fusing multi-sensor modalities at a 5 Hz solution rate on a laptop. Transition to low-SWaP platforms will be planned. In Phase II, POC will reach TRL-6 by implementing and optimizing the algorithm for the chosen computing platform and testing it on real-world datasets."

SIFTIC will collect type agnostic sensor data, including Imaging Infrared (IIR), Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR), electro-optical (EO) images, electronic support measures (ESM), light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and automatic identification system (AIS) data. The interface with many of these types of sensors has already been developed by our subcontractor Global Technical Systems (GTS) via their FusionCommand. The collected data will be fused using feature extraction, Bayesian networks, case-based reasoning, and multiple hypothesis reasoning. The fusion of IIR and ISAR data has already been developed in Stottler Henkes IR\/Radar Fusion project, and will be expanded to other possible sensor types as well. Finally, the fused data sets will be classified using computer vision techniques and deep learning. These techniques have all been implemented and applied to IIR and ISAR images in Stottler Henkes ExPATSS project. We also have the opportunity to test on real data collected by GTS and Raytheon as well as lab data of accurate ship models from UDRIs Mumma Radar Lab."

This two-prong approach, combines with the baseline handcrafted features used to augment the features discovered by the deep learning CNN algorithm, will provide unprecedented robust ship classification and potentially identification performance. For operationally utility, we will leverage industry commercial off the shelf (COTS) multi-core graphical processing units (GPUs) processors such as those already developed by NVIDIA and Intel specifically for deep learning implementations. Moreover, by combining the mathematical concept underlying manifold learning and compressive sensing, the multiple sensor data can be represented, fused, and used to classify ships by way of their class-specific coefficients (i.e., lower dimensional manifold) without loss of information. The sparseness of the data essentially allows lossless compression by greater than 90% allowing the compressive manifold algorithm to be designed for execution on low-power mobile processors such as GPUs or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)."

The Vadum approach uses an innovative Master-Slave architecture employing multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antennas to achieve beam steering and beam broadening at minimum overhead cost. Phase synchronization is achieved using a novel hybrid of experimentally demonstrated techniques employing both open-loop and closed-loop synchronization. The hybrid approach enables better beamforming in response to Channel State Information (CSI) and leverages a priori information such as GPS location and tight timing synchronization between nodes. The Phase-I effort includes a comprehensive analysis of ad-hoc beam patterns with respect to number of nodes, position accuracy, time, frequency, and phase synchronization to determine the optimal tradeoff between beam gain and beam width."

However, todays monolithic arrays are too heavy, expensive, and power hungry. The ability to form an ad-hoc phased array, from randomly distributed single antennas would be a huge step forward. However, challenges include the (unknown) rapidly changing relative antenna and target positions and orientations, scattering from the environment, Doppler shifts, equipment instability including clock drifts, electrical delays that vary with temperature, and interference. Therefore, it is essential to design a coherent communication and EW solution to achieve high power gain and improve signal quality at receivers and increased Jamming to Signal Ratio (JSR) at the target. Since transmit nodes are not physically connected, they need to coordinate with each other for distributed coherence communications between self-organizing transmitters and a cooperative receiver or cohere energy on a non-cooperative (non)radiating target."

        "abstract": "Mobile radios on highly dynamic platforms, when networked into a virtual antenna array, can perform distributed array agile beamforming (DAAB) to serve the purposes of communications at longer range, higher data rate, and higher quality of service, targeting (an imaging radar for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance - ISR) at longer range and higher resolution, and more powerful electronic attack (jamming\/spoofing), more efficient electronic protection (interference cancellation), and more sensitive electronic intelligence. To enable such a fault-tolerant agile beamforming, the topology of the virtual antenna array needs to be mapped (estimated) in real time for calculation of beamforming weights in the presence of geometrical and physical uncertainties with and without GPS signals. To solve this problem, we propose to develop an integrated navigation and networking of virtual array (INNOVA) technology that tightly integrates the position, navigation and timing (PNT) functionality with networking functionality. In Phase I, we will perform the algorithm design for the proposed INNOVA technology for DAAB and will evaluate its functionality and performance using simulation of realistic scenarios. In Phase II, the algorithms will be implemented into a prototype system for demonstration and evaluation."

        "abstract": "Dielectric materials, which store energy electrostatically, are ubiquitous in advanced electronics and electric power systems. Polymer dielectrics have highbreakdown strengths and excellent reliability, are scalable, lightweight and can be shaped into intricate configurations, and are therefore an ideal choice for many power electronics, power conditioning, and pulsed power applications. A variety of high-performance engineering polymers have been considered as possible high-temperature dielectric materials to address these urgent needs. These materials perform reasonably well at high temperatures but only under relatively low electric fields; there has been only limited success when the material is subject to both high temperatures and high voltages. It has been shown that improving thermal conductivity of the polymer film dielectrics vastly improves performance, but scalability remains an issue.Composite Technology Development, Inc. (CTD), in collaboration with Dr. Qing Wang and Carestream Contract Manufacturing is proposing to develop a polyimide-based nanocomposite film dielectric that will exhibit performance meeting or exceeding the desired performance targets and can be produced using an industry-standard roll-to-roll production process."

Magnetic shielding effectiveness will be evaluated in the Phase I Option period, and 3D printing of both the ceramic and metallic layers will be conducted in Phase II.

However, these railguns generate tremendous magnetic fields of up to 20 Telsa. These magnetic fields pose a threat to on-board, mission-critical electronics within the launch package. Mainstream Engineering Corporation will develop electromagnetic shielding to protect sensitive, on-board electronics from the magnetic fields produced in railgun operation. Mainstream Engineering will develop its layered electromagnetic shielding technology with a minimal thickness and weight. The shield will be composed of alternating layers of a conductive material and a proprietary, high magnetic permeability material to provide maximum shielding at a minimal thickness. Mainstream will demonstrate the concept in a sub-scale prototype in Phase I leading to full prototype delivery and testing in a relevant environment in Phase II. The final shielding material will be able to shield sensitive electronics from a 1-10 Telsa magnetic field for millisecond duration and demonstrate a compressive strength of greater than 100 kpsi."

        "abstract": "Identifying and resolving organizational inefficiencies often requires hiring external consultants. The capabilities of collaborative crowdsourcing, however, provide an opportunity for organizations to leverage their own employees to achieve this task. We propose the development of GECKOS (Generating Employee Crowdsourced Knowledge for Organizational Solutions), a tool that integrates a wide range of algorithmic capabilities to identify and resolve organizational inefficiencies efficiently and effectively. GECKOS brings together expertise in crowdsourcing algorithm development, distributed team performance, collaborative team motivation, decision making, and human-automation design. It will provide organizations with a continuous improvement capability that incorporates contributions and insights across all organizational levels and units. Consideration of anonymity, motivation, team and task design, data aggregation, and other factors will be critical to the design of GECKOS, as will the experimental plan and associated metrics to validate its effectiveness. Cognitive analyses and human-centered principles will guide the design of collaborative workspaces and rulesets governing interactions to promote collaboration."

        "abstract": "Organizations face two existential challenges: to anticipate and create surprise. Inefficiency and ineffectiveness are inevitable outcomes of the ensuing struggle. To mitigate these outcomes, organizations increasingly seek external help and guidance. However, the rush for such assistance betrays missed opportunity. Embedded knowledge and self-actualization among members remain largely untapped resources in decision-making within organizations.To address this shortcoming, Aptima proposes a system of trust capable of eliciting input from an organizations members systematically and, through an iterative process, producing a ranked list of solutions or proposals for executive action. Aptimas solution allows members of an organization to become key actors in enhancing the decision-making capabilities and well-being not only of their organization as a whole, but potentially of specific functional units and individual members therein. Aspects of behavioral game theory, collective decision-making, and network science will be used to inform an iterative process of collective divergence and convergence toward the end-goal."

Such organizations should study their own performance and seek ways to improve. However, there is always work for today more pressing than investments in tomorrow; and more critically, any large, effective organization generates forces that resist change.We propose to develop methods and technology to help make organizational improvement a more efficient, continuous, creative, and successful activity. We will design and build a system that supports Crowdsourcing for Hierarchical Organizations with Rationale, Design, and Stories (CHORDS). CHORDS will leverage the latest findings on how to orchestrate ad-hoc teams of workers to address complex taskse.g., through task structuring, worker selection, joint activity selection, and decision rationale exploitation. CHORDS will also apply emerging methods and tools supporting group work on framing and solving complex problems (design collaboration tools), and just-in-time sharing of expertise (embedded story libraries).During Phase I we will: characterize options for effectively crowdsourcing organizational improvement, while integrating design support and automated guidance; illustrate our vision and reduce risk by developing a limited proof-of-concept prototype; and refine plans for Phase II, including system development, evaluation, and transition."

        "abstract": "As organizations grow in size and complexity, it is only natural that inefficiencies exist. One of the challenges faced by organizations is the information needed to identify, characterize, and resolve these inefficiencies is located in different stovepipes and may be biased based on a variety of factors. Both crowdsourcing and human computation research and design thinking practices have developed ways to overcome these challenges and solve complex problems by leveraging the knowledge, skills, and experiences of contributors. Sonalysts proposes to leverage existing methods and technologies to develop the Visual Argumentation for Resolving Inefficiencies (VARI) platform, which will apply these algorithms and computational processes to design thinking methods. The VARI algorithm and platform will enable the rapid enumeration, characterization, and resolution of organizational inefficiencies by optimizing communication between contributors. VARI will use a novel visual argumentation method in tandem with state-of-the-art crowdsourcing and decision-making algorithms to enable contributors and decision makers to readily understand how different inefficiencies affect different aspects of the organization. Phase I will result in a demonstration of the feasibility of VARI, a proof-of-concept of the software, and a robust test and evaluation plan that will be used in the Phase II effort."

        "abstract": "One-size-fits-all approaches to physical fitness are characterized by extreme limitations. When not individually-tailored, workouts can be ineffective or worse: so strenuous that they lead to injuries. Advances in wearable sensors allow individuals to capture personalized data related to their own physical fitness (e.g., heart rate, step count). Unfortunately, with such an abundance of physiological and biometric data, it is difficult to understand how to best use sensor outputs when planning and updating ones own physical fitness program. Aptima will employ two complementary modeling approaches in a novel technology-based alternative to one-size-fits-all fitness program design - automated state modeling and adaptive training algorithms. The Physical Readiness Program (PREP) will customize existing fitness training plans based on assessments from an individuals sensor data and contextual inputs. PREP will collect data continuously and in real-time through sensor-agnostic models while also taking into account context through user-provided inputs (e.g., soreness, sleep). Evaluations of trainee sensor data will guide training program adaptations at both the micro and macro level. As such, training will be optimized according to a holistic interpretation of the individuals statebased on exercise and other observed activities as well as self-reports of well-being."

        "abstract": "To facilitate amphibious assault operations, the Marines need to quickly move amphibious combat vehicles (ACVs) between ships and the shore. However, due to an increased level of sophistication in the anti-ship weapons available to potential adversaries, Navy ships must remain far from shore during assault operations (i.e., many tens of miles). This creates a need for assault vehicles that can achieve high speed in the water over a long range. All existing and emerging ACVs have limited speed and range that do not meet the operational objectives. The need addressed here is the development of a long-range ACV sled that can carry an ACV from ship to shore at high speed. We have created an innovative sled design that mates up with the ACV without increasing the footprint of the vehicle on the ship. Once in the water, the sled deploys its floatation\/planing elements without manned interaction. Once near or at the shore, the sled and ACV de-mate. In Phase I, the Creare team will refine the overall design, including the concept of operations, by conducting analyses and consulting with our internal operations experts. We will also develop hydrodynamic scaled models to facilitate tow tank testing in Phase II."

This craft, referred to as a Sled, is based on the use of inflatable drop stitch panels coupled to a simple aluminum frame. This approach offers the means to collapse the sled in constituent parts that can be stored in a small volume. The propulsion system is also modularized for rapid integration. The sled design allows for loading of the ACV wile in the well of the ship and will deploy the ACV in deep water or on the beach. Ultimately the craft will operate autonomously. In Phase I requirements for the autonomy system will be defined. The sled design is simple and will offer an inexpensive means to rapidly transport ACVs from ship to shore."

MIDS-JTRS allows for increased capabilities, however, the dissipated power and therefore heat within the terminal are increasing.

FlexCool is a family of thin high performance heat pipes under development by Roccor for application to directed energy systems and spacecraft under DoD and NASA funding. By using emerging material technologies in thin sheet form and developing innovative diffusion bonding manufacturing approaches, Roccor has realized higher performing heat pipes in thinner components than ever before with thermal conductivities that can exceed 20,000 W\/m-K (aluminum: ~200W\/m-K) in thickness ranging from 1-2mm. ViaSat, one of three prime contractors developing next generation MIDS terminals, is included on the proposed work and will be consulted frequently to provide system guidance and ensure relevance toward successful technology transition and deployment."

The SRUs consist of electronics cards mounted in a sealed structure and secured in the chassis using standard wedge locks. Currently, the available heat rejection from the terminal is limiting the use of more powerful SRUs, and the Navy seeks a means to increase the ability to reject heat from the terminal with no impact to current size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints or system reliability. Our innovation is a comprehensive Thermal Management System (TMS) that addresses the near and long-term heat rejection needs for the MIDS JTRS. Our approach can increase the SRU heat rejection by more than 100%, far in excess of the Navys goal of 30%, while meeting or exceeding current SWaP requirements and maintaining the ease-of-replacement requirements demanded by current system maintainers. In Phase I, we will establish the feasibility of our innovative TMS. During Phase II, we will develop the prototype TMS, test and optimize performance, and work with our partner to complete pre-qualification testing to facilitate the near-term transition of the technology."

        "abstract": "Phase I effort will develop an innovative Exploitation of Discrete GPS interference for Enhanced navigation (EDGE) technology. EDGE uses existing antenna configurations and RF front-ends on a missile platform (or similar platforms) to detect and locate GPS interferers (jammers and spoofers). Localized interference sources are then exploited for navigation, targeting, and guidance. Common approaches are passive in that they only attempt to reduce (mitigate) any harmful effect of emitters on GPS receivers without realizing the potential that these interference sources could contribute to a hybrid navigation solution. To fill this gap, we go one step further and hereby propose a proactive strategy that explicitly makes use of GPS interferers to aid navigation when GPS is challenged, that is, to utilize stationary interference signals as signals of opportunity for navigation aiding (navaid). In Phase I, the proposed EDGE technology will be developed with its enabling techniques formulated into post-processing software prototypes and evaluated using a combination of simulated and experimental data. A prototyping approach of EDGE will also be developed for Phase II."

Such a diagnostic technique is needed to support computational modeling advancements that are critical to support Army force protection requirements against tactical and theater ballistic missile threats.This will be accomplished through the development of a plenoptic imaging system capable of capturing velocity and scalar fluctuation statistics in high speed missile base flow-like environments.Such measurements are required to advance current state-of-the-art models for turbulencechemistry interactions.The unique feature of this diagnostic approach is the fact that a complete 3D representation of the scalar fields may be obtained with a single instrument setup.This is in contrast to current reacting flow diagnostic procedures that require the instrument to be moved laterally to populate a 3D matrix of collection planes or points.As a result, current diagnostic procedures must be applied over many realizations of a flame experiment to populate the 3D data collection matrix.The simultaneous measurement of the entire 3D scalar field using plenoptic technology developed under this program will be ground breaking."

There are a plethora of sensor types that should be integrated into such a system; however, COTS solutions in this field are generally proprietary and thus limited in compatibility from many perspectives.The UTC solution is a unified technology platform; a total solution that can be used for anything from testing new occupancy strategies to implementing automated HVAC controls.By building the foundation of this solution on an open-source, tested, interoperable framework, the UTC approach will deliver a solution that can detect and react based on pre-defined sensor patterns without compatibility or implementation limitations typical of existing COTS smart building packages.The UTC team, including UDRI, SlickLabs, Harbor Link, and Greenspace, has the BAS interoperability experience from previous efforts with AFCEC, experience with facility-related control systems (FRCS), and innovators in the occupancy sensing space."

These techniques, while proficient at mitigating the specific threats they are designed to detect, offer little protection against modern file and document formats that allow for the embedding of arbitrary data.AIS proposes ABED to detect and prevent malware and exploits in less than five minutes by extending upon proven Machine Learning enabled exploit and malware detection techniques previously developed by AIS under Air Force contract TAFFI (FA8750-15-C-0017). By leveraging existing research, ABED will have out-of-the-box capability to detect threats embedded in various common file types that can be used as a foundation for endpoint defense.ABED research will focus both on improving the pre-existing TAFFI detector, and on using it to build an enterprise ready endpoint defense solution. We will develop a self-learning and continuous training capability for the detector, allowing it to quickly learn how to detect malware and exploits in new file formats. This self-learning detector will serve as the foundation of our approach, and around it we will design an endpoint defender that can use scalable enterprise computing resources when available but which can still defend endpoints in their absence."

Most existing cyber defense systems are still using the aged signature-matching techniques which can be easily avoided by current malware through polymorphic methods, such as obfuscation. In this effort, IAI proposes to develop DeepDefense, a deep-learning based cyber defense system to effectively detect and mitigate zero-day attacks. DeepDefense detects zero-day cyber-attacks by analyzing the software program behaviors which cannot be evaded by any polymorphic methods. DeepDefense utilizes a deep-learning based artificial intelligence method to automatically identify benign and malicious behaviors. DeepDefense will be implemented and run at the host end. Thus DeepDefense is network agnostic, and can provide uninterrupted security protection even under an encrypted network environment. The intrusion detection results from DeepDefense can be easily reported to an existing SIEM system to improve the security capabilities of mitigating zero-day attacks. Together, DeepDefense will provide advanced intrusion detection\/mitigation capabilities to enterprise networks, and provide continuous and uninterrupted security protection against zero-day attacks."

        "abstract": "The edge on the battlefield today comes from improved communications and real-time situational awareness. Current solutions relying on omni-directional antennas congest the RF space reducing the effectiveness of TCDL multi-node networks. In addition, the wide coverage pattern of an omni-directional antenna results in high probability of intercept, high probability of detection, and low protection from jamming. Using a directive mechanically gimbled antenna to solve the drawbacks associated with an omni-directional antenna will limit the number of supported communication links to the number of antennas capable of being installed on the platform, and drives SWaP-C to an unacceptable level.FIRST RFs proposes to address these drawbacks with an innovative multibeam active electronically scanned array (AESA) with integrated frequency conversion capabilities. The combination of FIRST RFs phased array antennas with integrated frequency conversion allows for a flexible system that is capable of up to four independent TCDL communication links while keeping the SWaP-C of the system at acceptable level. FIRST RF will also investigate extending the frequency conversion capability within the AESA to provide I\/Q analog baseband signals, or potentially digitized I\/Q signals, to enable the use of lower cost, or even software defined, radios."

In onedesign scenario, the MIMOnizer offers Range Extension Mode (REM) via link margin improvements realizable by appropriate MIMO modes such as Space Time Block Codes (STBC). In another scenario, the MIMOnizer offers High Capacity Mode (HCM) in addition to REM where it can boost the legacy TCDL radios original spectral efficiency up to the factor of N (number of antennas).Our plan for Phase I is an extensive software based simulation study that will investigate the benefits and performance gains of the available MIMO options under different scenarios. Wealso plan to do a preliminary hardware MIMO demo based on the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) Software Defined Radios (SDRs), which will also serve as the basis for the Phase II work where we will implement the full features of the MIMOnizer applique."

(PSI) will demonstrate a non-flammable, high power rechargeable battery design capable of 20C discharge rates after activation from an inert, inactive state. This battery will be constructed by combining PSIs non-flammable electrolyte and high active (HA) coating technologies. During the Phase I, PSI will demonstrate that the electrolyte is non-flammable both as an aerosol and on ejection from a cycled battery. Optimized HA electrodes will be prepared and used to construct coin and pouch cells to demonstrate the ability of the cell design to deliver the targeted rate performance. PSI will demonstrate the battery can be stored in an inert, inactive state and that the targeted performance can be achieved after rapid activation. The results of the lab scale tests will be used to design a prototype battery for an Air Force\/ICBM identified application. Successful completion of these efforts will demonstrate the readiness of the technology for further scale-up and demonstrations in Phase II."

        "abstract": "Makai Ocean Engineering, Inc. proposes to address thermal management performance shortfalls for 6th generation air platforms by developing a novel heat exchanger technology. Specifically, Makai will develop an ultra-compact foil based heat exchanger (FFHX) for air-cooled, two-phase vapor cycle systems. The FFHX will provide at least a 50% improvement in volumetric performance, pressure drops of less than 1psi, and lower weights compared to the current state-of-the-art.The FFHX manufacturing process uses advanced and high-precision techniques that enable use of thin foils (0.0015 inch), custom flow geometries, surface enhancements, elimination of backing plates and tension rods, and most importantly enabling irregular and non-rectilinear heat exchanger volume envelopes.Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations show air-convection coefficients of at least 350 W\/m2-K. Combined with surface area densities of 2000 m2\/m3, this results in more than 50% improvement in volumetric performance compared to the Honeywell metrics. Makai will work with LM Aero to achieve additional performance improvements by exploiting irregular, peripheral spaces in the air platform, which is not possible with current state-of-the-art units.Prototype plates have been pressure tested to over 500 psi at Makais facility in Hawaii, making this a relatively low-risk development and shortening the transition timeline for the USAF."

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) will develop an innovative refrigeration condenser for airborne applications based on PSIs established fractal heat exchanger geometry. This configuration is 60% smaller and 20% lighter than comparable heat exchangers because it uses a branched feed network instead of pipe headers (the heaviest parts of existing heat exchangers).Test articles will be produced with a volumetric energy density of greater than 4.7kW\/L (60% better than current) and a specific power greater than 7.4 kW\/kg (20% better than current). These laboratory test samples will verify the performance of the design in preparation for full-scale testing in Phase II.PSIs condenser is light enough to be used on refrigeration-equipped aircraft to enable cooling of internal components. The condenser reduces aircraft drag because of its reduced cross-sectional area. It improves packaging within the aircraft due to its reduced overall volume. Together, these changes make it feasible to consider refrigeration as a means to increase internal heat loading on a 6th generation fighter airplane.The advances in mass, frontal area, and volume are made possible by PSIs novel geometry, which makes use of recently-developed numerical optimization techniques and additive manufacturing of metals."

To this end, Creare proposes to develop an ultra-compact, lamination-stack condenser with built-in air flow headers to substantially reduce the overall condenser assembly size and mass. The condenser has a unique configuration to simplify its integration with air ducts and thus minimize its installation envelope and mass. The condenser flow channels have features tailored along the flow direction to enhance the overall heat transfer while minimizing flow pressure drop increase. The proposed condenser assembly will achieve a volumetric heat capacity twice the current state-of-the-art condensers. In Phase I, we will first work with our OEM collaborator to identify a target application and develop design specifications. We will prove the feasibility of our approach by building and demonstrating a proof-of-concept subscale condenser, developing the Phase II condenser prototype design, and predicting its performance. In Phase II we will design, build, and demonstrate a laboratory condenser prototype under prototypical conditions and deliver the prototype to the Air Force for further performance evaluation."

        "abstract": "Automatic conversion of computer aided drafting (CAD) geometry to computational grids appropriate for high fidelity hypersonic analysis is needed. With respect to grid quality, the output must be purely hexahedral and C2 continuous, even at extraordinary vertices. To accomplish this, a pipeline of local and global CAD repair algorithms will feed into a feature-preserving quadrangulation module with optional adaptive surface refinement. Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces will be iteratively aligned to the quadrilateral surface meshes to provide a lightweight parametric representation. Recent advances from the computer graphics community will be employed to assure C2 continuity at extraordinary vertices. These techniques map a C2 continuous polynomial onto the subdivision surface with a C2 continuous compact weight function. The result will be projected back into the UV space of the input CAD to enable geometric surface sensitivities. Proven quadrangulation algorithms will then be extended to 3D hexahedralization to enable the automatic generation of purely hexahedral volumetric grids. Similarly, 3D subdivision volumes will map hexahedra to continuous, lightweight parametric representations. An additional library will be created to discretize the parametric grids and push them directly into processor memory. Bypassing the hard drive in this way is essential for parallel scalability to billions of grid cells."

However, mechanical computer-aided design (CAD) data preparation and manipulation continues to dominate most CAE activities, hindering the use of advanced engineering simulation tools, and resulting in excessive costs across a broad range of design and manufacturing activities. Recently, the animation industry has developed fast methods for generating 3-D renderings of parametric models using subdivision methods. These methods for rapidly generating polygonal surfaces from CAD show great promise when applied to grid generation since they may be tuned to ensure that continuity requirements are satisfied. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of applying subdivision method to potentially automate the process for creation of multi block structured hexahedral meshes in a fully coupled definition between CAD models and discretized domain required by CFD tools."

        "abstract": "To address the Air Forces need for a tool to evaluate, understand, and predict key influential technology areas within a multi-domain, Air Force-centric future challenge, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Bayesian Multi-Domain Evaluation Tool (BAMDET) based on novel integration of a new analyst interface with a backend software component built around recent advances in proven Bayesian network theory. Specifically, the innovations in streamlined, Excel-based operator interfacing, and automated sensitivity analysis will enable the key Air Force commands to perform analysis of alternatives (AoA) faster and to develop high-value technologies with limited resources. As a result, this technology offers an analytical capability to overcome challenges in identifying which mission and multi-mission system of systems (SoS) provide the greatest value, which directly address the Department of Defenses requirements for informed AoA. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of BAMDET by developing a methodology to include uncertainty in the conditional probabilities of Bayesian networks, describe how this methodology can be applied to the Air Forces development planning process, and provide an example of how it can be used to estimate the effectiveness of alternatives. In Phase II, POC will develop and implement a delivered BAMDET tool."

        "abstract": "Development planning is a critical task in the US Air Force (USAF) that is required to efficiently acquire new and improved vehicles, analyze strategic and tactical gaps in the USAFs missions, guide investment strategies of new technologies, and plan for future workforce skills. One of the key development planning tasks is analyzing the impacts of alternative designs on the potential system of systems (SoS) concept of operations (CONOPs), its ability to meet the desired measures of performance and effectiveness (MOPs\/MOEs), and the sensitivity of the system to various internal and external factors. Yet performing this analysis is difficult and costly due to the complexity and variety of systems, as well as the uncertainty within and impacting the systems. Bayesian networks (BNs) have been used to satisfy these development planning. However, BNs are insufficient as a technological base because of their rigid structure and limited support for advanced analysis. To address these development planning gaps in multi-domain USAF systems and operations, Charles River Analytics proposes a method for Probabilistic Programming for Analyzing Complex Systems (PPACS). This comprehensive, generalized tool uses advanced probabilistic programming languages and probabilistic relational models to support a wide variety of development planning needs. This will enable systems"

DE will improve acquisition, management, and engineering of defense systems throughout their lifecycles. Realizing these benefits will require deployment of an ecosystem that will impact people, process, tools and IT infrastructure; and incur related costs.Many architectures are possible for the DE ecosystem. Each architecture will satisfy different stakeholder needs and incur different costs at different times. We propose the development of an Integrated Dynamic DE Ecosystem Cost-model (IDEC) that models costs at an enterprise level and supports analyses of alternates. We will identify gaps between DE IT needs and existing DoD capabilities. Costs to fill IT capability gaps will be incorporated into IDEC. Ecosystem deployment costs for people and processes will be incorporated into IDEC. IDEC will model risks and support sensitivity analysis.IDEC will address stakeholder budgeting requirements and support analysis across types of appropriations. We will define and prioritize potential cost model outputs and develop a methodology to analyze costs. Phase I will demonstrate this methodology using a Microsoft Excel model. Phase II will develop an efficient web-based software tool to automate cost model analysis."

Optimized Mesh-networking Platform Navigation (OMPIN) is hereby proposed to support networked heterogeneous munitions equipped with a disparity of sensing capabilities. The design of OMPIN takes advantage of the fact that the navigation states of one weapon is practically decoupled from anothers, making it possible to implement an atomic decentralized estimation in which individual nodes first estimate their own state using measurements aboard and then apply inter-nodal measurements. In the decentralized filter, each node only estimates its own navigation state, not its neighboring nodes, thus being scalable. However, it takes into account the uncertainty of those assisting states as well as cross-correlation between nodes in contact. In Phase I, the proposed OMPIN technology will be developed and evaluated via computer simulation together with mutual aiding between networking and navigation. Radio systems suitable for ad hoc networking with inter-nodal measurements will be studied for prototyping in Phase II."

The system will be based on a biologically inspired compound eye, with built-in small-FOV (&lt; 3 degree) apertures to block sunlight and prevent blooming in sensitive imagers, using an active system with moving pigments that blocks or attenuates sunlight on demand. Biological systems such as these cannot be mimicked simply and directly with existing processes. Thus, a pair of gradient-refractive-index (GRIN) lenslet arrays will be fabricated that break the FOV into subapertures with a tight focal plane between them, and an electrophoretic light-attenuating cell array (ELACA) will be fabricated to block the light at the beam waist before it is delivered (via the second lenslet array) to the imaging camera. Lenses in an array will be varied, or chirped, as needed (each being different than its neighbor) to reduce wide-angle aberrations. Light transmission will be nearly 100% in the off state, and about 10 nJ will be used for each on\/off cycle."

Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are unique materials that combine properties of ultrahigh strength metals with processability of thermoplastics, which is often paired with other attractive attributes, such as high resilience, fracture toughness, hardness, and corrosion, erosion, and wear resistance. This project is focused specifically on thermoplastic forming (TPF) of BMGs that enables a wide range of geometries and functionalities in BMG products that are not possible to achieve with other materials and processing methods. The goal for Phase I is to mature and advance commercial opportunities for TPF of BMGs specifically for structural and functional space applications and, in later phases, for other areas of aerospace and defense. The scope of work includes an assessment of the overall advancement in the field of bulk metallic glasses, prioritization of applications, proving feasibility of the proposed methods, and developing a proof-of-concept for several BMG products with plans for manufacturing and insertion into spacecraft design."

        "abstract": "WW Technology Groups (WWTG) proposed effort provides a scalable and powerful framework and foundation for Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) of Big Data (BD) with a software toolchain.The approach uses an established front end to perform the connection to data storage and flow of information that can consume a wide variety of data types and formats found in engineering documents.A series of BD analytic methods are used to reduce the information into a meta database.Advanced techniques are introduced to enhance the structure and mapping of this metadata for use in unified MBSE system model.WWTG existing tools are then used to manage and display the unified model and perform Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The methods will enable development of knowledge structures and mappings to obtain the highest quality information for seeding designs, development of capabilities, and efficient system integration with substantial prior knowledge from the vast collection of technical development documentation provided to the Government through years of system acquisition and sustainment.The capabilities to be developed are an extension and integration of existing tools that will readily integrate with existing DoD processes and capabilities."

        "abstract": "The amount of cross-domain data available to the designer today, and the speed at which it continues to grow is unprecedented. The data often come from heterogeneous sources that were developed independently, without a consensus on the syntax or semantics. The integration of the heterogeneous data is possible because of the access to its respective metadata, or data about data. The availability of vast amounts of cross-domain data led to the development of the Big Data (BD) technologies - a wide range of new standards, processing paradigms, architectures and frameworks, that are being actively applied in virtually all domains. BD tools are capable of discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in vast amounts of data. The analytics utilize algorithms from across different fields, such as distributed machine learning, data mining, pattern mining or computer vision, to name a few. The challenge of comprehending entire DT goes well beyond the scope of the proposed work. VIStology and Raytheon are proposing to focus primarily on the Capabilities-Based Assessment and develop methods and tools that leverage Big Data Analytics (BDA) supported by semantic technologies to extract and link design artifacts from common engineering documents to conduct trade space exploration."

        "abstract": "Spent Rocket Bodies (SRB) from decades of launch of satellites into Earth orbit are the largest component of space debris by mass, and they may pose a significant present and future threat to operation of space systems in certain orbits. Most of these objects will remain in place for several more decades before they re-enter the Earths atmosphere and eventually burn up. Recognizing the broader challenges of space debris, multiple organizations have created concepts for mitigating that debris and de-orbiting space junk. The concepts include attaching propulsion modules, electrodynamic tethers, and drag enhancement devices including sails and balloons. USAF is interested in long term reduction in the number of large SRBs in low earth orbits, especially near-polar and sun synchronous orbits to help preserve and extend the effective use of space. Vishwa Robotics proposes a completely novel, low cost, use and lose, miniature space craft that will engage a tumbling SRB and stabilize it and perform a controlled deorbiting maneuver without use of any external tether or power source like solar panels, RTGs etc., except a small battery."

System architecture trades will survey the space debris population to establish a detailed set of design requirements and to drive initial structural and packaging analyses.These efforts will necessarily be performed in close communication with sail and boom material vendors to identify practical and cost-effective designs."

        "abstract": "The potential for damage resulting from a collision with orbital debris in Low Earth Orbit has become a significant danger to active, viable space missions. Policies intended to curb the debris growth rate are being overwhelmed by the rapid growth in small satellites.The preponderance of these satellites has a short mission life, often 12-20 times shorter than the expected time those objects will remain in orbit. A projected growth in small launch vehicles will compound the problem by increasing the quantity of rocket bodies in orbit. Rocket bodies are of particular concern because they pose a significant risk for fragmentation. MMA has successfully demonstrated an effective de-orbit system on a small launch vehicle upper stage. DragNET systems accelerate the orbital decay by 10x or more, but are designed to be launched with the object it will bring down. MMA proposes the development of a Space In-situ Deployed Engagement Re-Entry (SpIDER) dragNETTM or SpIDERNETTM that incorporates an atmospheric drag membrane with an autonomous engage and deploy capability that requires no power after deployment. This integrated system would enable a host satellite to identify a desired debris target and de-orbit the object, reducing the potential for collision and debris propagation risks."

Optical interconnects have advantages of high interconnect density, low energy consumption, and high speed timing capability. In this proposal, we plan to study die extraction and reassembly (DER) of hybrid photonic integrated circuits to replace passive devices and obsolete packaged ICs on a circuit board to increase high-speed routing of information in packaged ICs.DLP7000, a popular Digital Micro-mirror Device from TI is chosen for demonstrating the DER process in this phase 1.The DLP7000 is used widely in displays, medical devices, lithography, and 3D printing and serves a versatile model containing optical, mechanical and electronic components.We plan to accomplish the DER through a comprehensive and systematic approach where we will a) initially assess and develop suitable DER techniques, then; b) refine and re-evaluate, as needed and finally; c) implement the DER of the selected photonic IC on Si substrate and perform testing to full compliance with MIL-STD-883."

        "abstract": "Many injuries in the battlefield are being treated by non-medical personnel(e.g. 42% of tourniquet applications are applied by non-medical personnel). Unfortunately, most non-medical personnel are not provided with opportunities to practice medical skills in a high stress environment prior to completing them during live missions. This lack of practice of critical skills is related to a need to focus training on the Warfighters primary MOS when completing integrated training and the high cost of practicing with medical mannequins. To meet this training gap and provide a low-cost and flexible training tool that allows all Warfighters to practice first response medical skills during high stress force-on-force training exercises, the Network Enabled Medical Training (NetEMT) Toolkit will be designed and developed. The proposed platform will evaluate trainee performance and provide essential cues using simulated medical equipment instead of mannequins. The NetEMT Toolkit will be designed the integrate with the Armys Live Training Engagement Composition (LTEC) to allow for the flow of force-on-force exercises to continue through medical first response. The design of the proposed system will be driven by a task analysis, cue fidelity evaluation, and training needs analysis."

(GSI) is based on using available nanosize additives which upon reaction within the detonation front will enhance blast and impulse (in the case of the explosive) as well as increase thrust, impetus and projectile-velocity in the case of propellants. Inclusion of other additives to conventional explosives and propellants upon reaction produce finely subdivided particles of metals (perhaps nanosize) as well as metallic vapors such as aluminum which allows for a fast combustion early in the detonation process thus enhancing blast as well as impulse.In the presence of propellants it can increase thrust and impetus. In the case of propellants preliminary GSI results show (20-30%) increase in impetus and measured projectile velocity; in the case of explosives (in arena tests) blasts and impulse enhancement as high as 50% were observed."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for a fire control radar for small UASs, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop an Advanced Fire Control Radar for Group 1 and 2 Unmanned Surveillance Systems (ARGUS). ARGUS is a compact, lightweight, and low power sensor that directly fits in the electronics or payload bay of Group 1 and 2 UASs. It interfaces with the platforms flight computer through standard UAS buses, through which it transfers the high fidelity radar information to a remote operator or the ground control station for visual confirmation and countermeasure. ARGUS innovative system design and algorithms provide (a) a device with large computational capability within a small form-factor that consumes low power, which is sufficient to detect, identify, and track threats with a low false alarm rate using radar cross-section data; and (b) a system with a platform-agnostic, low SWAP design which can be used in both Group 1 and 2 UASs. In Phase I, POC will design ARGUS and develop limited-scale benchtop hardware to show component feasibility. In Phase II, POC will develop a field ready, TRL-5\/6, UAV-mounted ARGUS with threat detection capability that can be demonstrated to a suitable customer for further transition."

These enable the radar to achieve 4 times more range than normal radar could do with the same output power. The IFT radar system is capable of detecting most group 1 UAV at 1 kilometer distance and group 2 at 1 mile. It can also identify the distance with high resolution as well as signal direction of arrival. IFT designed two different radar configurations. A fixed narrow beam radar system has low weight and size. It is suitable for a small group 1 UAV application.A 360 azimuth coverage radar is slightly larger and it can be easily deployed on a group 2 UAV,"

The proposed technology is versatile and amenable to designs for all types of pump combiners, including direct fiber bundle combiner and combiner with a signal fiber.Phase I will demonstrate enhanced coupling efficiency by producing a scaled down prototype with a 3-fiber combiner.A larger prototype with higher fiber count, with be tailored to critical DoD laser applications and will be built and extensively tested in the Phase II."

        "abstract": "The DoD envisions UMS to provide significant operational benefit to dangerous protection tasks, such as CASEVAC. Such systems have the potential to remove first responders from harms way and improve the outcomes of combat casualties by enabling rapid CASEVAC in hostile conditions and environments. Multiple designs for such platforms exist. However, in addition to requiring active remote control for most tasks, these common-use platforms are likely unable to perform all necessary CASEVAC functions on their own. The DoDs recent push for multi-mission capable platforms suggests a different approach: employ groups of smaller UMS to support all required CASEVAC functions by leveraging advanced autonomy and collaborative teaming technologies. To meet this need, Charles River Analytics proposes to develop a modular hardware\/software Body-aware Robotic Appliqu for Collaborative Evacuation (BRACE). BRACE integrates cutting-edge capabilities in collaborative autonomy, manipulation, supervisory control, and perception, including precise 3D human pose and shape estimation, to ensure safe physical interaction with casualties. These capabilities will enable current and future UMS to maneuver safely and efficiently over land, collaborate with other platforms, and execute specific casualty evacuation tasks, such as lifting a patient to load a standard litter."

        "abstract": "Our service members deployed worldwide are at risk of exposures to local environmental and industrial toxicants which can potentially result in long-term adverse health effects. Understanding the impact of these exposures is critical for improved force protection and safeguarding individual soldier health. Capturing and classifying exposure data is essential for developing and implementing risk mitigation strategies. A longitudinal set of biosamples collected over a service members career is a rational strategy to generate an archival medical record which could serve to document exposures and health effects both during and after service. Dried blood spots (DBS) on filter papers represent an effective medium for collection and storage of blood samples in the clinical setting, but cannot be effectively translated to field conditions due to logistical challenges of collection, storage, transporation and ensuring sample stability under hot and humid conditions. Lynntech proposes to develop an innovativespecimen collection and storage platform which will circumvent these limitations of DBS for exposure tracking, but still utilize the basic DBS technology for blood collection, preservation and transportation. Lynntechs envisioned product will enable effective specimen collection and preservation in the fieldwhile also streamlining processing workflow to reduce current logistical hindrances."

        "abstract": "SRICO proposes to develop electro-Optic (EO) phase modulators with stable and flat frequency response, low switching voltage-length product, and multi-decade environmental lifetime for use in strategic-grade high-precision inertial sensor systems. The electro-optic modulator lies at the heart of interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (IFOG) and accelerometer sensor systems and ultimately determines system precision and stability. Integrated optic lithium niobate modulators based on annealed proton exchange (APE) are typically used in these systems. However, APE waveguides suffer from temperature and time dependent frequency response because they are produced through a relatively low temperature ion exchange process. Higher temperature Ti-diffused processes yield relatively stable waveguides, but suffer from non-flat frequency response and photorefractive effects. Thus, there remains a need for electro-optic modulators with flat and stable frequency response over the decades of life span of the sensor system. To meet this need, this proposal develops advanced waveguide technologies that emulates the material properties of APE waveguides but that exhibits the long term stability of the high temperature Ti-diffusion process. Successful completion of this effort will have confirmed the favorable properties of the proposed waveguide optical phase modulator technology for use in precision inertial sensor application."

The equipment will correct the power factor from .98 leading to a minimum .97 lagging while complying with Military Standards 461, 704, and 810 (810 is modified for shock and vibration by MDC3376 spec). During Phase I, we will investigate design approaches for the PFCU. We will design an active, parallel PFCU that can be integrated into the existing aircraft power system and will turn On\/Off when the aircraft is airborne. The Phase I effort will include plans for a fully functional unit to be developed under Phase II. The candidate methods identified in Phase I will be analyzed more extensively during the Phase I Option in preparation of developing a full scale evaluation unit in Phase II.In Phase II, we will develop a full size prototype that is capable of being added onto an aircraft electrical bus and should demonstrate the desired power factor correction during flight based on the Phase I research results."

We propose to design a two-tap, common-core, passive, 3-phase inductor comprised of innovative tri-cores. We will compare ferromagnetic materials, conductive materials, inductor configurations, and switch types and perform a trade study of total weight vs total losses. Initial studies indicate the corrector supplies excellent power factor performance across the full load range: 20 kVA to 65 kVA remaining between 0.88 and 0.97 lagging. The inductor will be designed for all relevant environment and interface specifications. In Phase I, we will fabricate and demonstrate a form-fit-function breadboard power factor corrector at full rated power capable of correcting leading power factor to a target of 0.93 lagging in compliance with military standards. In the Option effort, we will optimize the mechanical, thermal and packaging aspects of the unit. In Phase II DTI will work with the Navy to ruggedize the system, and to integrate the mechanical and electrical interfaces into the target air frame. Finally in Phase III, DTI and partners will work to transition the technology to the Navy directly and to any potential commercial customers."

The proposed PFC hardware will be turned on\/off through a 400 Hz contactor, and will be installed into a rugged environmentally sealed housing. The proposed PFC hardware weighs less than 20 lbs, is &gt;99% efficient, is a small form factor, and relies only on natural convection cooling at the maximum ambient temperature of 71 deg. C. This passive magnetics based approach was selected over more complicated power electronic (active) based approaches as it provides a system that is much more reliable, rugged, and overall smaller and lighter."

This activity will include a trade-study developing both passive and active power factor compensation solutions to a sufficient level that PCKA and Navy personnel can select the preferred solution from a system perspective. In addition to the trade-study, the Phase I activity intends to demonstrate the feasibility that the selected approach can meet the weight and performance targets of the Navy, as well as the electrical and mechanical specifications of MIL-STD-461, MIL-STD-704, MIL-STD-810\/MDC3376. A combination of advanced modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A) along with hardware demonstration where appropriate will be utilized to demonstrate that the proposed design is capable of meeting the identified requirements."

But historically, UHF radars had resolution and detection issues that have made them ineffective for accurate targeting and fire control. Higher frequency radars provide the benefit of higher angular resolution. Migrating to higher frequencies (S-band) can enable weapons quality, high-resolution target tracks from the radar, thus guiding missiles accurately to the target. Higher frequencies also result in higher peak transmit power for radar systems to meet the link budget. Hence the Transmit-Receiver (T\/R) modules that support these frequencies to build a complete phased-array radar system need to be designed with high power-density to obtain desired Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP). IAI proposes a modular, low-profile MSPAR design to address this problem, and will meet the functional and operation requirements for Nay airborne radars."

These tools will be useful as an untapped resource to aid in ATS planning and support. Data mining can serve to expose run-time inefficiencies or under- and over-utilized test equipment (or specific capability ranges within a piece of equipment) and provide significant benefit to the selection of new ATE components during replacements and upgrades. Broad questions can be answered about ATE component capabilities including not only the frequency of their use but also the manner of their use.

        "abstract": "For years the DoD ATE community has been trying to build an open architecture environment that would support avionic testing across and within services. Little progress has been made in this area due to lack of applicable standards and a common vocabulary that could communicate test requirements required by the various users. This has led to non-standard designs in the ATEs and their associated tools. The proposal describes a method and approach that utilizes an appropriate set of existing IEEE standards designed to address this problem. However, these standards have not been utilized effectively based on the lack of guidelines for the selection of optional elements necessary to support the broad scope of use cases and common vocabulary of test parameters. The approach taken is to effectively utilize the modeling capability of the standard to build a library of signal models. A testing taxonomy structure of test categories and parameters will be used to identify these parameters. They will address both the UUT and ATE capabilities making the identification and utilization of a library of signal models that will allow for the development of a management tool that will be capable of supporting model development, TPS operation and resource interfacing."

        "abstract": "Experience in utilization of test information standards exposes levels of allowable variance that circumvents interoperability and allows proliferation of incompatible products. The standards must provide this flexibility in order to accommodate the variety of applications for which they are intended. However, achievement of compatibility, interoperability and other objectives associated with the commonality are underlying assumptions of standards usage in general. Innovative approaches to controlling, restricting and even denying allowable variations can provide a vehicle for better achieving these objectives while still requiring adherence to the standards. These approaches can additionally improve usage of standards in regards to applications supporting definition of test hardware and instrumentation. Moreover, levels of precision and accuracy can potentially be enhanced through these same mechanisms. New strategic utilization and improvement of signal modeling related standards are focal points for these objectives. Currently standards allow users to develop widely disparate and essentially custom implementations that are still within compliance boundaries. Formulation of technical strategies that contain the independent development aspects of signal models can restrict the proliferation of disparate products developed from these standards. The innovative strategies would produce the interoperability, precision and even cross vendor compatibility the DoD is striving for."

        "abstract": "Survivability of military rotorcraft is a critical mission objective requiring extensive testing and analysis for various hover and flight modes of transport. Typical analysis requires Electro-Optic\/Infra-red (EO\/IR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensing at a wide variety of environments, flight configurations, and sensor types and orientations using high-fidelity EO\/IR and LIDAR modeling. The principal difficulties associated with generating 3D rotorcraft plume signatures are two-fold: (1) the generation of 3D exhaust-plume flowfields in the presence of rotor blade downwash and complex vehicle geometries, and (2) the utilization of that data for composite signature predictions, which includes hot-parts emission, plume emission, and plume-shine reflection. The innovation described in this proposal is the development, verification, and demonstration of a computational framework that addresses currently observed deficiencies associated with rotorcraft-oriented EO\/IR signature modeling by combining within a single focused effort validated CFD and EO\/IR signature modeling capabilities to develop a streamlined rotorcraft signature prediction procedure that (1) minimizes multi-module data hand-off errors; (2) streamlines IR signature throughput via better data exchange synergy; and (3) establishes an effective baseline for supporting future advanced rotorcraft-focused signature physics modeling including the incorporation\/demonstration of an accurate and robust LIDAR capability into the new framework."

Specifically, the project team will integrate the NASA FUN3D unstructured CFD solver with the JANNAF Standard Plume Ultraviolet Radiation (SPURC) EO\/IR signature modeling tool. FUN3D is used extensively for rotorcraft aeromechanics analysis and has undergone extensive validation for rotorcraft applications. SPURC is widely used in the EO\/IR signature modeling community and is well validated for the prediction of UV-LWIR emissions from a low-altitude plume and thus ideally suited to rotorcraft applications. The Phase I effort will focus on developing an optimal integration approach, demonstrating the coupled CFD-EO\/IR capability for rotorcraft signature prediction, and investigating modeling fidelity tradeoffs. The effort will establish a variable-fidelity approach where modeling of complex physicssuch as aeroelastic blades and the inclusion of combustion byproductsmay be switched on and off in a hierarchical approach to understand their relative influence on the resulting signature. This approach also directly supports situations where advanced modeling parameters may not be known and lower-fidelity models are preferred."

Moreover, these tools must possess trustworthy validation and be acknowledged as reference standards if they are to be accepted by and serve NAVAIR and DoD survivability groups. We propose to design, develop and deliver SPIRITS PLUS (Plume and LIDAR Upgrades for SPIRITS), an upgraded SPIRITS model with greatly-improved capability to model the signature effects of rotorcraft downwash and exhaust plume, and of laser radar. SPIRITS is nationally recognized and enjoys a long and broad history of validation against DoD and military systems. Our proposed effort brings together Aerodyne, developer of SPIRITS, Continuum Dynamics, Inc., nationally recognized experts in rotorcraft CFD, and Dr. Paul Markarian, developer of SPURC. The Phase 2 deliverable will be tested, documented, and ready for validation against field data, and will be suitable for furnishing to a Government Configuration Control Authority (CCA) for distribution and sustenance. It will also include software and version control modernization to enable the CCA to support a continuous-release cycle of incremental accrual and distribution of community-contributed enhancements."

UNIC, will be composed of several DOEs in a form of Computer Generated Holograms, designed digitally and arranged in a stacked setup with separation distance less than a millimeter. Thus, the cascaded CGHs can use free space propagation between these elements to handle the large spectral width and can exhibit a superior performance in uniformizing input beam, regardless of the beams starting spatial configuration. In Phase I, a single diffractive CGH will be demonstrated and spectral dependence will be investigated further. In Phase II, we will fabricate and demonstrate the UNIC system with 3 or 4 elements for the desired parameters for the agency. Thus, after completion, we believe that UNIC will provide innovative solutions to the beam homogenizers of the next generation."

        "abstract": "The output of the traditional optics fibers produce a Gaussian-shaped output due to the internal mode structure. Moreover, the output from traditional optical fibers contains spatial non-uniformities that are undesirable for certain applications. Many advanced applications require a flat-top intensity distribution of the laser beam as it produces uniform illumination and minimizes speckle. The Navy is seeking lightweight mid-infrared beam homogenizers capable to convert radiation from a multimode fiber to a flat-top beam. Among all-fiber techniques that use multimode fibers, flat top beam generation has only been demonstrated by fiber core shaping (fibers with e.g. square or rectangular cores). However the intensity profile of the beam maintains the same shape as the core and the rectangular or square beam shapes are difficult to efficiently integrate into existing circular-fiber based laser systems, resulting in significant loss of light. TIPD proposes to develop compact all-fiber low-loss circular-shaped homogenizer capable to operating across the 0.9-6 m spectral range. TIPDs homogenizers are based on novel infrared glass fibers with an advanced microstructured core design providing excellent mode mixing and a flat top beam output. The Phase I program will demonstrate the feasibility of developing such a novel all-fiber homogenizer for various Navy applications."

S. Navy. The ALAMO is an air-launched A-sized profiler that carries a high-quality conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensor. The ALAMO is rated to almost 4,000 ft (1200m), currently costs about $20,000 (with CTD), and can perform almost 800 profiles to 1,000 ft (300m), for a cost per profile of about $25. In Phase I, we will assess the current ALAMO design for ease of adding new sensors, research ways to increase reliability and lower the cost per profile, and address issues that may arise during the air certification process. In the Phase I option period, we will improve the pre-launch checkout and launch protocols, and create the drawing and document package that will enable a smooth transition to prototype manufacturing in a possible Phase II."

(ISS) proposes to develop a new Modular Ocean Environment Profiler (MOEP) system. It will utilize a novel compact buoyancy control module combined with a completely submersible solar energy harvesting and storage system for long lifetime ocean monitoring. The system incorporates ISSs field-proven dynamic power management technology for unattended sensor operation and data transmission via Iridium satellite. Sensor systems will be directly interchangeable within the main body of the device to maintain a constant operational envelope as required for existing air launch A-sized buoy deployment. In Phase I, ISS will demonstrate the feasibility of the MOEP technology through design, assembly, and demonstration of the compact buoyancy control mechanism, submersible solar energy harvesting, and storage for use by the dynamic power system used by the sensor modules. In Phase II, ISS plans to design, fabricate, and test a fully integrated prototype system and demonstrate open-water capability with at least two different measurement types."

Our experience in expendable dropsondes provides a baseline for an updated tactically relevant solution. Based on previous developments in the dropsonde area and similar R&amp;D efforts that increase the TRL by leveraging existing technologies, we can show feasibility in the short term while also hitting aggressive long term cost targets. Driven by a prime contractor with over 20 years of proven success commercializing technologies including maritime devices, Proteus promises success for NAVAIR and future transition partners. Our team and network of connections to the user community provide reduced risk with increased probability of transition. Proteus provides a persistent (12 months) solution that provides easily backhauled environmental, acoustic, thermal, and optic\/turbidity data through 1000 ft water columns at tens of dollars per profile. PH I will define the system design and test critical subsystems, enabling PH II success through use of our existing capabilities and technology in the oceanographic, dropsonde, and sensor markets and a focus on the main challenges of this specific development (persistence and cost)."

Riptide proposes this new Persistent Environmental Measurement AUV (PEM-AUV) would fully satisfy PMA-290s stated objectives, but would also provide a flexible, mobile capability for future developing missions. Mobility of the platform would also allow PMA-290 to position and reposition the PEM-AUV as desired, eliminating or reducing the impact of currents in the region of interest.The primary objective of the Phase I effort will be to develop the optimized vehicle solution capable of meeting or exceeding PMA-290s stated goals for persistent environmental measurement. A design trade will be conducted across a range of parameters with PMA-290s input on threshold and objective criteria. Riptide anticipates providing a mobile capability able to conduct multiple profiles per day for one month or more."

PCI has operated fuel cells on high sulfur fuels for over 1000 hours. PCI proposes to build on this experience to provide a major advance in UAS fuel efficiency, range, life, and reliability, with a modular system designed for maintenance and upgradability. During Phase I, a baseline IFCS that produces a minimum of 0.51 kW will be designed and feasibility demonstrated. Process modeling and flight simulation tools will be utilized to show UAS adaptability. A high-fidelity IFCS solid model with a comprehensive list of UAS performance specifications, backed by experimental data, will be delivered. During Phase II, a lightweight prototype will be fabricated and its functionality will be demonstrated. The scalability to 10 kW will be demonstrated. During a Phase III, the IFCS will be matured to TRL 5\/6, with ruggedization and environmental compliance."

        "abstract": "In this proposed SBIR project, Nexceris will design, develop and demonstrate an ultra-high power density, integrated fuel cell system (IFCS) unmanned aerial systems (UAS) power and propulsion. The targeted system will operate on military logistic fuel (JP-5 or JP-8), deliver 1 kW of power, and weigh less than 35 pounds, and the design will be scalable down to 500 watts and up to 10 kW. In Phase I of this project, Nexceris will establish a preliminary design for a 1-kW scale power system that meets he specific requirements stated in the solicitation (which will be further refined during the project). Work in the Phase I Option will involve design of the Phase II integrated demonstration system. In Phase II, high power density SOFC stacks of the targeted design will be built and tested against design requirements, and a demonstration system will be built, tested to validate system operation under targeted conditions, and then delivered to NAVAIR. Successful execution of this project will result in a substantial improvement in simplicity, reliability, size and weight of SOFC-based power systems."

(ISS) proposes to develop a new Multiple Decoy Sub-payload Timed Automatic Release (MDSTAR) device. It is based on a cartridge assembly consisting of multiple ejectable, independently timed and triggered pyrophoric payloads. Specifically, the innovation in payload packaging design with integrated mechanical safety and adjustable timing fuse mechanisms will enable the MDSTAR device to accurately release and control the timing for multiple pyrophoric payloads from a single housing using a single standard CCU-136 impulse cartridge. As a result, this device offers a significant improvement to pyrophoric countermeasure IR signature and duration compared to existing countermeasure technology, which directly addresses the Navys need to protect aircraft against modern missile seekers. In Phase I, ISS will demonstrate the feasibility of MDSTAR by completing the design and simulation of the main housing and sub-payloads prior to fabricating representative prototypes and completing ejection performance testing. In Phase II, ISS plans to fabricate inert and fully functional prototype MDSTAR assemblies for Navy flight testing, achieving technology readiness level (TRL)-7 upon completion."

        "abstract": "The MJU-49\/B decoy is an infrared countermeasure dispensed by the ALE-47 countermeasure defense system to protect Navy aircraft form incoming threats that utilize infrared sensors. This decoy uses pyrophoric foils that react with atmospheric air upon release to give an infrared signature whose emissions are tailored to the threat sensors. The Navy has identified that greater protection would be afforded to aviators if the pyrophoric foils from a single countermeasure cartridge could be released in multiple increments rather than all at once. CMA Technologies, Inc. (CMA) is proposing a purely mechanical approach based on a proven, but inaccurate technology developed by our partner company Alloy Surfaces Company, the manufacturer of the MJU-49\/B. In this project CMA design an accurate, reliable and robust purely mechanical system that will give highly tailorable release of pyrophoric increments. The timing and number of increments can be easily set at time of manufacture. Our approach will be rugged enough to operate across the full MJU-49\/B environment to include temperature, vibration and shock and will have no HERO or electromagnetic concerns."

The ideal pyrophoric countermeasure would rapidly maximize its cross-sectional area to make a desirable target in a pattern or shape which draws the seeker as far away from the aircraft as possible. A linear dispensing pattern consisting of multiple spaced packets may achieve this affect. In this proposal, Rocky Mountain Scientific Laboratory (RMSL) presents two novel concepts for the timed dissemination of pyrophoric foils from a MJU-49\/B compatible sub-payload.

Peregrine will develop software services ready for Fleet Exercise (FLEX) exerperimentation and transition to the JMPS Multi-Vehicle Planner. Peregrine will provide air planners with services that (1) connect to, synchronize, and transform dynamic data, including geo-rectifying image and video data and vectorizing high-density raster data; (2) recalculate entity position and effects based on change, including support for automated geofencing and plan-based event detection; and, (3) visualize the resulting information in new air-planner oriented 4D overlay representations. These representations will be generated in multiple DoD and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) industry standard data formats to ensure that the products are available across multiple Naval visual display technologies including the JMPS Multi-Vehicle Planner. The Peregrine team members are Navy visual display thought leaders, with over a decade researching and fielding 4D spatio-temporal displays as well as extensive METOC, electronic warfare, air planning and UAV autonomy experience. Peregrine will leverage the teams robust display architecture, which supports both the OGC stack and NGAs Common Joint Mapping Toolkit stack and includes components currently fielded by Navy programs of record"

        "abstract": "In complex tactical scenarios, mission planners are often confronted with mission goals and operational environment restrictions that limit their options. High cognitive workloads produced by manual assessments and operational concerns increase tactical decision timeframes. To address these problems and support mission planning and operations within National and Foreign Airspaces, Space, Maritime, and Land domains, mission planners need automated planning assistance which can quickly animate (visualize) the routes and mission plans and the tactical risks to personnel and property. To maintain the tactical initiative, Mission planners and Battle Management Aids must optimize mission performance in faster than real-time under dynamic, multi-variable conditions allowing Mission Commanders to initiate tactical actions on their terms. LG-RAID addresses these shortcomings. Using LG-Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a multi-domain mission planner, LG-RAID constructs an optimal 4D, geo-rectified, animated overlay that provides entity visualization and predictive Course of Action analysis capability for dynamic, multi-variable conditions within seconds on a standard desktop computer."

        "abstract": "We propose achieving high power mid-infrared arrays with interband cascade vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL). Unlike quantum cascade lasers, optical selection rules in interband cascade lasers allow vertical emission. The massive parallelism of a VCSEL array will allow small, low power lasers to achieve high total output power with no speckle due to spatial incoherence across the array. Mid-infrared VCSELs have already achieved room temperature, continuous wave operation. We propose improving on state-of-the-art using several innovative approaches: growth on Si for improved thermal management; lower absorption cavity design; improved quantum well design; an oxide aperture to reduce loss by moving the optical mode and the pumped active region away from sidewalls, and improving their overlap; and electroplating with the very high thermal conductivity copper. To extract the heat, we propose modelling of heat pipes to spread the heat over a larger area, then a cold plate to extract heat from the heat pipe. To combine beams from different VCSELs, we propose using COMSOL ray matrix to model microlens arrays combined with macroscopic lenses."

With the inherent low efficiency of QCL devices, there is a limit to the amount of extra power that can be coaxed out of a device before the amount of waste heat generated overwhelms the available cooling. In order to increase the power output of these devices, and simultaneously reduce the thermal management needs, innovative pathways such as development of broad area vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) could be beneficial. Here, Forward Photonics in combination with the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) propose to use a novel technique for controlling the output mode of a QCL to produce a broad area single spatial mode laser with high output power and efficiency."

        "abstract": "Aircraft routinely encounter turbulence and pilots must respond appropriately to turbulence to maintain safe aircraft operation within the prescribed operating limits, and to effectively accomplish missions. Pilots of manned aircraft can readily assess the severity of turbulence, and naturally maintain a high degree of situational awareness with regard to the turbulence level. Operators of unmanned aircraft cannot rely on the physical sensations that onboard pilots do to assess turbulence levels, and automated systems are needed onboard the aircraft to identify the turbulence level. The information then needs to be conveyed to the operator in a format that can be readily interpreted and used to make appropriate operational decisions to protect the air vehicle and meet mission objectives. The proposed Turbulence Recognition and Decision Support System for UAS is designed to quantify turbulence in two distinct ways: in terms of the level of turbulent energy in the atmosphere, and in terms of its impact on key air vehicle states including attitude, altitude, airspeed, and accelerations. The system relates the estimated quantities directly to operating limits and forecast values from weather products to support decision making by the UAS operator."

The methodology borrows from Fault Detection Filter design approaches, and uses a model-based scheme that is sufficiently general to permit its adoption onto a host of UAS platforms ranging in size and operational environment. Use of existing available data onboard the UAS avoids the need to install separate measurement systems, such as LIDAR-based sensors, and the system ultimately promises to help reduce structural fatigue loads on the UAS, leading to extended operational lifetimes. The Phase I program here will demonstrate the technology via limited simulation trials and a flight test program, and will provide sufficient risk reduction to allow for continued development to a prototype demonstration at the conclusion of the Phase II research and development program."

        "abstract": "Atmospheric turbulence is ubiquitous for all manned and unmanned flight vehicles, regardless of vehicle size and speed. Turbulence is generally compensated for by the pilot and flight control system and factors into aircraft design, flight envelope definition, and mission profile. If high-intensity turbulence is encountered, structural damage and\/or loss of control can result, leading to mission abort, and in extreme cases, catastrophic failure. For manned aircraft, the turbulence level is pilot-determined based on feel. For Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), detection and recognition of turbulence must be performed by other means. The Navy seeks a real-time, robust, low-computational-overhead, on-vehicle system for UAS to recognize and quantify turbulence severity levels. As a solution, we propose the Systems Technology, Inc. Turbulence REcognition AlgorithM (STREAM). STREAM will leverage existing sensors to quantify time-varying turbulence intensity levels in real-time using an efficient onboard frequency-domain-based algorithm that can be seamlessly applied as a software update to existing and future UAS of varying weight and speed class. These data can be sent to a remote operator for better-informed decision making or can be used for autonomous control algorithms on board. STREAM will be developed and demonstrated in Phase I via simulation with relevant UAS models."

        "abstract": "Mission planning is critical to successful deployment of military power. Mission planning is a complex task that requires the detailed orchestration of many subcomponents and elements of human performance in varied, real world environments. This task is becoming yet more complex and challenging as the DoD begins to explore missions that include both manned vehicles and unmanned platforms and incorporate multi-domain air, ground, and sea elements. Mission planning tools and processes do not yet scale to these future challenges, and mission planners may soon be overwhelmed by this complexity. To meet this need, we propose to design and demonstrate Learning Upgrades to Mission planning ENvironments (LUMEN). LUMEN features: (1) a deep learning suite applying deep learning approaches to mission planning problems and mission planner support to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of mission planning workflows; (2) automatically generated causal DNN explanations to enable appropriate trust and understanding of deep learning recommendations; (3) a narrative-based human machine interface (HMI) design to enable mission planners to effectively use these models; and (4) a joint mission planning system (JMPS) integration and security classification layer to enable interoperability with current and future mission planning systems."

        "abstract": "GBL proposes the Rapid Artificially Intelligent Strike Mission Planner (RASP) to develop a layered technology approach that allows for the application of Machine Learning to this complex mission\/strike planning domain. The integration of RASP with JMPS will provide a foundation for implementing Artificially Intelligent Mission Planning techniques that learn from prior mission experience\/data. GBL proposes to utilize its NO4-174 EA-18G Electronic Combat Automation SBIR technologies called Electronic Combat Decision Support System as a core technology that will be leveraged. RASP will provide a Distributed Intelligent Agent-based framework (DAI) to automate development of platform mission plans. The Agent-based framework implements a publish and subscribe message system to allow for collaborative and concurrent planning amongst multiple mission planning teams across security levels while minimizing the face-to-face communication that slows the mission planning process. The decentralized capability of RASP will reduce mission planning time by allowing multiple users to simultaneously plan their role in a mission vice the waterfall method of planning that is often practiced today. The intelligent agents will communicate planning information amongst necessary users to help improve the mission planning workflow and ultimately reduce the overall time and improve automation of mission planning for multi-vehicle strike mission platforms."

Operating in harsh desert or marine environments is the primary causes of debris buildup. A self-cleaning coating technology developed specifically for V-22 heat exchanger units will enable the aircraft to function more efficiently, and extend its operational range. We have identified an emerging Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation aluminum conversion coating process that transforms the metal surface into its own ceramic form. The ceramic state of the aluminum surface is able to receive our novel super-hydrophobic self-cleaning surface coating. Our new duplex coating technology has been evaluated for 3xxx series aluminum heat exchangers, and found to completely eliminate debris build up in harsh environments. In addition, to the delight of our sponsors, our developments also provide greatly reduced costs versus toxic aluminum anodizing and conversion coating techniques. We will provide our patented, environmentally benign, self-cleaning binary coating technology system to address all DoD needs and those of the global community for safer, yet completely effective systems to maintain the surface of V-22 heat exchanger units."

        "abstract": "Aluminum heat exchangers suffer from reduced performance and increased maintenance due to fouling. Of the coatings currently available for heat exchangers, most are severely fouled when the coating surface comes in contact with oils and dust. A superhydrophobic and oleophobic coating would reduce fouling and make cleaning easier. Nano Terra has developed a coating for aluminum parts, called NT-AL, based on a textured, low energy surface which completely resists wetting by water and oil. The coating is &lt; 30 micrometers thick and so would not interfere with heat transfer. It is erosion resistant and is intimately bonded to the aluminum surface so that the coating will be robust even in high particulate environments. In this program, Nano Terra will refine the NT-AL process for the Navys heat exchangers and verify the maintained performance, fouling resistance and wear resistance. In parallel, Nano Terra will develop a low-surface energy polymer coating with a textured surface that will provide similar superhydrophobicity and oleophobicity to NT-AL but potentially better erosion resistance and different chemical stability. Finally, Nano Terra will apply the best two of these approaches to heat exchangers and show improved performance in fouling conditions."

During operation, the outside environment brings in the dust, grime, oil and sand which can foul the heat exchanger surface. Deposits on the surface create an insulating layer that increases the thermal resistance and reduces the process efficiency. Regular maintenance of the heat exchanger is required to clean off the surface, reducing military readiness by the taking aircraft out of the service and consuming funds on maintenance activities that could otherwise go for active missions. In this SBIR project, TDA will develop a hydrophobic and oleophobic surface coating that would repel dirt and fouling to prevent it from building up in the first place. The coating will be applied as a thin film layer, uniformly across the heater exchanger fins in a low-cost industrial process. In the Phase I project, we will demonstrate that the coating has hydrophobic\/oleophobic properties, measure heat transfer properties across a coated test panel, and characterize its physical properties."

        "abstract": "There is an ongoing need to improve the design of low-frequency, high-power, broadband sonar transducers for use in A-sized sonobuoys. Desired improvements include lowering the frequency, increasing the power, increasing bandwidth, reducing size, reducing weight, and lowering cost. Most sonobuoy applications currently utilize flextensional or flexural transducers that use piezoelectric PZT type ceramics for transduction. Single crystal piezoelectric ceramics have been investigated as possible improvements to PZT. A major drawback, however, is that they are costly and are size restricted which limits low-frequency and high-power usage. Recently, textured PMN-PT ceramics have been developed. They have piezoelectric properties that approach those of single crystal ceramics, with the advantages that it can be fabricated in larger sizes with lower cost and can be driven at higher drive levels. Therefore, a transducer made with this material has the potential to produce more source level and can also can be designed to be more compact, lighter, have a broader bandwidth, and higher effective coupling than one using PZT. During Phase I of this SBIR Program, Massa will develop an A-sized transducer for sonobuoys using textured ceramics that will contain the desired improvements."

        "abstract": "As targets of interest become increasingly quieter, there is an ever-present need to increase the performance of active transducers (projectors) to improve the detection range and probability of detection for targets of interest. The projector performance metrics in particular that need improvement include: higher source level, lower operating frequency and increased bandwidth while minimizing weight. This is easier to do when size and power are not limited, however, due to the sonobuoy A-size form factor (4 7\/8 x 36) space constraints there is a limitation on the size and power, and that is the challenge that must be overcome. The objective of this SBIR program is to design, develop, fabricate, and demonstrate a projector that exploits the enhanced properties of PMN-PT textured ceramic. The new piezoelectric material, PMN-PT texture ceramic, presents the opportunity to address the challenge of increasing an active sonobuoy performance metrics for low frequency response, increased sound pressure level (SPL), increased bandwidth, while still capable of being packaged in the size constraints of an A-size sonobuoy( 4 7\/8 x 12) when other necessary components of the sonobuoy such as surface electronics, subsurface electronics, subsurface batteries, suspension and cable pack are factored into the space budget."

Cushioned clamps serve an important role in securing hydraulic, fuel, and electrical lines in Navy aircraft. The existing cushions have shown sporadic and unreliable breakdown in use, despite being rated to a rigorous MIL standard. Tetramer proposes to develop a new cushion material based on polyurethane elastomers. Tetramer has previously used this chemistry to develop elastomers with improved chemical resistance, hydrolytic stability, and tear strength. The Phase I effort will aim to demonstrate enhanced material performance against the combined effects of UV, ozone and hydraulic fuel exposure. With the proposed technology, the operational lifetime for clamp cushions in the Navys demanding environment can be extended, saving costly premature replacement."

        "abstract": "In an effort to extend the service life of the Navys aging fleet of F\/A-18E-F Super Hornets, the U.S. Navy has launched a comprehensive modification program to enable the fighter jets to fly more than 50-percent longer than originally intended. Under the PMA 265 Acquisition Program, it is expected to push the flight hours of the Hornets Service Life Extension Program from 6,000 flight hours in some cases beyond 10,000 flight hours. A current issue associated with the maintenance of the aircraft platforms are the indirect costs associated with clamp cushion (MIL-DTL-85052 B clamp loop cushion) failures that crack shortly after installation on aircrafts due to Ultraviolet (UV) and ozone exposure. Given this situation, the Navy is seeking alternative materials for hydraulic clamp cushions that are resistant to UV and ozone exposure and compatible with the respective JP-4 (MIL-DTL-5624) and petroleum based hydraulic fluid (MIL-PRF-5606) used by the Navy. To address the challenge of this Phase I opportunity, Lynntech will develop an omniphobic, UV and ozone resistant cushion material for the MIL-DTL-85052 B clamp that is highly responsive to the Navys unique environmental requirements for their hydraulic, fuel and electrical clamp applications."

        "abstract": "HMC has chosen to employ a two-pronged approach to our ECC research and development efforts. The first approach involves research and identification of hybrid elastomeric compounds that can be engineered for long-term stability in the difficult mechanical and environmental conditions required for this application. The first path in this effort Includes research and development of fabric based hybrid materials that can be coaxed with an elastomer mordant. Combining or coaxing fabric or fiber strands within a compatible polymer will not only improve UV and ozone resistance, but also serve as a binder capable of providing the tensile and elastic properties needed for U.S. Navy aircraft clamp cushioning. HMCs second research and development effort will focus on reconfiguring the current mechanical portion of clamp assembly, concurrent with the development of the ECC cushion component. This effort will include redesign of the metallic core of the loop clamp so that the cushion can be easily installed and securely fastened within a recess or slot positioned at the inside diameter of the clamp. The objective of this design modification is to expand the list of candidate elastomer compounds that can be considered for improving the manufacturability of the entire clamp."

Current Periscope Detection Radar systems lack the spatial resolution needed to detect small objects, have large SWaP, and are not suitable for small aircraft and rotorcraft. Alternatively, LIDAR systems exist which have high spatial resolution and long operating ranges, but suffer from low scan rates, and therefore limited scan areas, due to the low repetition rates (100s of Hz) of the bulk-optic lasers used. Lastly, in order to achieve high probability of detection and low false-alarm rates, a means to discriminate the hard return signal from a periscope or buoy from waves and surface movement.To address this need, SA Photonics proposes the development of our HawkEye LIDAR system. HawkEye utilizes our high repetition rate Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA) fiber-based laser system that enables the ability to scan a large target area. The HawkEye system is a complete LIDAR detection system with built-in beam scanning, and high sensitivity digital receiver. The Hawkeye system is compact and low SWAP and is compatible with sky ball turrets on MH-60 and equivalent aircraft."

Electronically steering the pointing direction of the laser and the field of view of the laser receiver enables a timely response by the laser-based system to any breaching of the sea surface by a periscope. The emerging technology of diffractive waveplates enables electronic beam steering for narrowband systems such as lasers and active imagers along with electronic control of illumination spot size. In conjunction with a high-efficiency, short pulse laser illuminator and high sensitivity laser receiver, we propose an electronic beam and field of view steering system that can address any location in the field of regard within a response time that is orders of magnitude shorter than the time it would take to slew a conventional gimbal system over a comparable angle. In addition to enabling rapid response and high resolution detection, electronic beam and field of view steering is expected to have a major favorable impact on system size, weight, and power consumption."

These craft may be operated by forces from recognized adversaries such as Iran or North Korea, by Rogue States or by violent non-state actors whose ideology encourages violence against US interests. To counter this threat, the US Navy is developing new tactics and technologies to reduce the threat from FACs in littoral waters. Rapidly detecting, identifying, and tracking small fast attack craft using multispectral electro-optical imaging is a key force multiplier for the US Navy. The proposed high speed multispectral imager uses the polarization of the reflected light to reduce the background signal and to provide additional information on targets in the area of interest. The multispectral polarization imaging system (MPIS) will be compact and light enough to be used in both fixed-wing and rotary-wing naval aircraft."

        "abstract": "Detection, classification\/recognition, and tracking surface vessels on water is very challenging for many reasons. Haze, marine layer, and\/or other particulates can attenuate signal and create path background radiance, all of which reduce the contrast of the target against the background. The intensity and spatial frequencies of the background often mimic the surface vessel making acquisition and tracking of the target difficult. As stated in the solicitation, water wakes from fast moving boats such as the Fast Attack Craft (FAC) can produce wakes that have similar signatures or partially obscure the target.  Polaris Sensor Technology proposes to design in Phase I and develop in Phase II a Visible\/NIR, SWIR, MWIR, LWIR imaging polarimeter with 15 to 3 degree zoom capability. Polarization has been shown to increase contrast and reject background noise in multiple wavebands. Polaris will combine multi-spectral sensing, polarimetry and advanced image processing algorithms to develop robust acquisition, tracking, and classification capability in a single sensor."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE)-compliant Countermeasure Dispenser System (CMDS) Operational Flight Program (OFP), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new CMDS FACE-compliant Interoperable Reusable Software (CFIRS). CFIRS is based on a novel implementation of an adaptation layer that provides an interface between the CMDS native code to the underlying computing hardware environment. As a result, the current hardware-specific, tightly-coupled CMDS OFP becomes FACE-compliant and thus portable to a variety of hardware platforms irrespective of its hardware type, operating system (OS), or input\/output (IO) interfaces. Due to this, the code can be reused in a variety of different platforms with FACE-computing environments without major development requirements thus reducing redevelopment costs. This, in addition to POCs infrastructure and experience in developing FACE-compliant military avionics, will be leveraged in the CFIRS development to provide POC a head start in transitioning CFIRS to the Navy. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of CFIRS though system analysis and will develop limited capability software reaching technology readiness level (TRL)-3\/-4. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully functional prototype that will reach TRL-5\/-6 and be ready for initial tests at Navy facilities."

The AN\/ALE-47 Operational Flight Program (OFP) is an example of such a system. Migration to a new platform incurs risk because it requires some level of change to the existing code base. Great cost and effort in testing and maintenance have been invested to bring the system to maturity. This is especially true of mission-critical tactical systems. However, migration offers the opportunity for enhanced performance, greater interoperability, and reduced software lifecycle costs. A balanced approach is required that maximizes gains in performance, interoperability, and lifecycle cost savings while minimizing risk and the cost of migration. SimVentions believes it has the experience, knowledge, and tools to provide such an approach. SimVentions will rely upon the knowledge gained as a member of the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACETM) Consortium, the experience of re-hosting the Nulka Controller software in a Data Distribution Service (DDS) environment, and tools developed for other efforts like Dexter, Tactical Monitoring and Injection Tool (TCMIT), and Ada to C++ to re-host the AN\/ALE-47 to run on the Intel i7 or Xeon processor in a FACE environment."

The A2TE will utilize dynamic message discovery, extraction, and validation by leveraging and modifying existing SimVentions tools to support test scenario generation, setup, and execution of multiple scenarios to provide automated operator and sensor inputs to test the system performance, without manual intervention. This test engine will implement a model-based system characterization of the different MDF configurations to evaluate system performance using automated data reduction and analysis to provide reporting. To facilitate test scenario setup and provide a foundation for scenario development, a generic framework for defining scenario conditions and inputs, message contents, valid sequences, timing, and expected responses will be developed. The intent is to combine these new test engine components with existing test capability in the AN\/ALE-47 STE, to provide an automated test solution to increase software reliability and reduce cost and schedule related to the manual test process."

        "abstract": "Using integrated teams of Operational Analysts experienced with Naval aircrew training and Software Engineers experienced in developing dynamic analysis and reporting tools for aviation, a pragmatic and scalable approach to aircrew performance assessment and proficiency is proposed. Initial techniques to incorporate data fusion of disparate data sources are summarized from past experience and existing software solutions. These techniques can be applied to aircrew performance assessment to reduce instructor work-load while also increasing the speed and accuracy of assessment. A process outline to decompose training scenarios in a manner that supports automation, human-in-the-loop techniques, and advanced data science is presented for further refinement during the research. The methodologies proposed for research all include the ability to scale across multiple platforms, training devices, training missions, and aircrew configurations through innovative application of modern programming paradigms. The end result is a design realizing this innovation in a user-oriented toolset supporting actionable feedback in a performance assessment and proficiency system."

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to design a software solution that consolidates performance data from multiple sources to ensure that data collection and assessment processes are accurate, efficient, and effective. The designed solution will leverage the work already conducted by NAVAIRs Training Analysis Project (TAP) regarding F\/A-18 air warfare. In doing so, the software will adhere to training best practices and align with the performance metrics that TAP has already identified as being critical to mission success in Component Commander plans. Since TAPs processes were designed to be scalable, this software will provide a methodology for the NAE to duplicate the entire TAP process for other platforms and mission sets in a manner that is streamlined and efficient. Artificial intelligence will be applied to enable automated and semi-automated methods for collection of data, assessment of performance, and reporting of training deficiencies. This improves the speed and effectiveness of the feedback to the trainee and the NAE leadership. The software will be designed to reside on hardware that is already resident at Fleet training locations (to reduce the physical footprint) and will incorporate an intuitive user interface (to minimize the need for additional aircrew training)."

        "abstract": "The Navy seeks to leverage data science-based tools, methods, and principles to achieve a warfighting advantage over our enemies. For example, aggregate data regarding Warfighter proficiency could help the Navy to make better-informed decisions on topics such as curriculum redesign, simulator acquisitions, and weapons platform acquisitions. However, in order to create such a proactive and predictive decision capability, the Navy first needs to develop reliable, valid, and unobtrusive measures of Warfighter proficiency that can be collected during training. Additionally, the Navy needs to develop a big data infrastructure that can integrate the Warfighter proficiency dataacross squadrons, training events, missions\/tasks, and timeto identify meaningful trends that will guide decision making activities throughout the Naval command hierarchy. To address this critical need, Aptima will develop the Aircrew Performance Measurement and Proficiency System (A-PuMPS). When complete, A-PuMPS will contain two primary system components. The first component is training-focused; it will ingest streaming simulator data to develop reliable, valid, and unobtrusive measures of Warfighter proficiency during training. The second component is data science-focused. It will systematically merge, aggregate, de-identify, store, clean, fuse, visualize, and model the Warfighter proficiency data to support proactive, data science-driven decision making."

The proposed SD-Link will build on the team&apos;s previous published work in FSO communications using spatial diversity and the team&apos;s previous STTR collaborations. SD-Link will combine proven multiple-input-multiple-output equalization, spatial diversity, beam tracking, and digital signal processing to improve reliability of current FSO communications. The Phase I will focus on system design of the spatial diversity FSO communication link as well as the beam tracking system. In Phase II, the team will build on the Phase I design to further mature SD-Link. Specifically, in Phase II the team will demonstrate performance of the optical links using modeling and simulation, prototype critical elements and demonstrate in a controlled environment, quantify the benefits of SD-link compared to existing techniques in similar environments, develop an approach to air vehicle integration, and identify remaining technology challenges. In Phase III, R-DEX will work with its academic and industrial partners to further develop SD-Link for both Government and commercial applications."

        "abstract": "Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication systems have numerous advantages over traditional RF based wireless systems including high data rates, long link distances, extremely low probability of interception and detection, and the ability to operate in RF denied environments with complete resistance to jamming. Additionally, compared to RF systems, FSO systems have very low Size, Weight and Power (SWaP). These advantages are often viewed to be hampered by the challenges of operating through the atmosphere, which creates scintillation and absorption that can disrupt the communication link. To address these issues, SA Photonics has developed innovative techniques that provide robust and reliable communication through a wide variety of atmospheric conditions, while maintaining a simple and low-cost system architecture. There are currently no FSO systems in use today on airborne platforms, mainly due to the need to use large and expensive stabilized gimbals. SA Photonics AgileBeam FSO system includes internal optical beam stabilization that allows the terminal to be directly attached to the aircraft, greatly reducing the cost to deploy and allowing use even on small UAVs. With the resulting compact size and robust and reliable performance, AgileBeam promises to enable widespread transition to the warfighter."

TWS approach will lead to the development of a cyber-physical system which integrates its physics-based modeling, NC toolpath optimization and data collection capabilities into a closed-loop adaptive control machining system. The system will monitor real-time force and temperature data, compare with an optimized digital baseline, and adjust the machining parameters to control machining-induced damage, optimize material removal rate and improve tool life. The resulting manufacturing data including temperature, forces, hole quality and dimensional accuracy will be retained and integrated into a part digital twin providing needed traceability of the part manufacturing process. The interoperability among machines, tools, sensors and people, a core design principle of Industry 4.0, will drastically improve quality control, increase manufacturing efficiency and reduce operational cost."

        "abstract": "Waterjets are widely used to cut and trim composites and techniques have been developed to trepan and pierce materials without causing delamination or fiber break-out on the exit side. However, using waterjets to mill countersunk holes has not been demonstrated before. This project will use a patented waterjet milling process to show that waterjets can successfully mill countersunk holes in composite materials for airframe structures without damaging the material. The proposed process is robust, reliable, inexpensive and very flexible, cutting holes from as small as 0.060 to inches in diameter, without the risk of heat damage to the material. The process is projected to be much faster than mechanical cutting tool methods and the nozzle wear life is in excess of 70,000 holes. Waterjet equipment already at the Fleet Readiness Centers could be used to cut stand-alone parts and tooling can be developed to drill holes in-situ on aircraft. In addition to carbon fiber products, the process can also be used to cut glass and aramid fiber reinforced product and even cut laminated titanium-graphite materials. The process works on inclined holes and laminated structures that include composites over metal framework."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a maritime Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) System using ISAR data for the Tomahawk Missile, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new ATR System, Automated Identification of Maritime ISAR Targets (AIMIT). It is based on modern deep-learning techniques for identification of objects and salient features in image data. Specifically, the innovation in using deep- learning image recognition algorithms for maritime ISAR targets will enable the Tomahawk Missile navigation component to accurately target hostile ships, while avoiding innocent bystanders. Additionally, AIMIT deep-learning algorithms are computationally efficient at runtime and updatable via parameter files. As a result, this technology offers a high probability of correct identification, computational throughput sufficient for a 5 Hz update rate, and the capability to readily update the system with new targets. It directly addresses the Tomahawk Missile Program requirements for SWaP, update rate, and classification accuracy. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of AIMIT by demonstrating the performance against either a synthetic or experimental dataset, reaching TRL-3. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a prototype to show that the performance of AIMIT against representative data is acceptably high, bringing the technology to TRL-4."

Our Phase 1 program will develop a practical machine-learning based ISAR ATR system that addresses these challenges. The system will be designed to achieve high target recognition and confuser rejection performance, to be robust to target state and environmental conditions, to be easily extensible to classification of new targets, and so that online processing may be implemented on low SWAP hardware to meet demanding smart munitions timelines. To create this design, the Phase 1 effort will integrate and utilize high fidelity RF propagation and scattering simulations to drive trade study analyses that will identify deep learning architecture attributes, model training strategies, and sensing and signal processing approaches that address seeker-based ISAR target recognition challenges in maritime environments."

This track management task can be overwhelming today, and will become more difficult with new adversary approaches such as unmanned air systems and swarming surface tactics including saturation raids. While AEGIS provides some capabilities for automatically identifying potential threats, making recommendations, and even engaging threats, its decisions are based on fairly rigid rules that do not take into account the current context in which the ship is operating. Instead, watchstanders must build up and provide their own context about the battlespace, the geo-political environment, and the normal background activities that occur in the environment. By not taking this information into account, current AEGIS tools leave the operators with too many tracks to manage on their own. SoarTech and team propose to design, develop and assess a ship-board Virtual Assistant to significantly reduce the workload of AEGIS operators. This Virtual Assistant will help watchstanders make decisions by learning relevant information from the environment and the watchstanders, providing additional context for decision-making, and making recommendations about tracks and potential responses."

IDA will alert the operator with critical events and recommend possible COAs in near real time as data becomes available. IDA will learn the operator behavior on the console using advance AI techniques and will continuously learn or adapt itself to provide personalized information to the user that will be contextually relevant to the user and mission.

        "abstract": "The objective of the Topic N181-034 is to develop concepts for a cut-resistant vibration isolation module (VIM) hose, which plays an essential role maintaining the performance of the TB-37 Towed Array System. VIMs act as a shock absorber that attenuates effects of mechanical noise caused by ship motion and the tow cables strum. The proposed effort will use a comprehensive materials-based approach to toughen the VIMs outer jacket against widely-used high-tension fishing longlines, with 1000&apos;s of fish hooks, which can span more than 10 kilometers in length. The proposed approach will leverage the latest developments in fabric reinforced rubbers and advanced additives to develop a wear and cut-resistant VIM jacket materials for improved service like performance. Material selection and testing will be optimized using statistical Design of Experiments. Experimental results will be validated using computer simulation modeling. A major objective of the proposed approach is to preserve the current manufacturing methods and supply base so the SBIR technology can be transitioned into the fleet in a time and cost-efficient manner."

        "abstract": "As described by the Navy, a surface ship towed array VIM (Vibration Isolation Module) hose that is resistant to cuts, abrasions, perforation, and other mechanical damage is needed by the Navy. The surface ship fat line VIM is a fluid filled hose that reduces the low frequency vibrations experienced by towed array sensors, such as the TB37 surface ship towed arrays, by attenuating the vibration through the VIM and especially through the hose wall. However, the soft hose material used in current VIM hoses is susceptible to cuts from floating materials such as fishing lines. A cut-resistant towed array VIM hose would increase the availability of existing surface ship towed arrays and reduce lifecycle costs. The Navy seeks innovative approaches to providing vibration isolation to, while reducing or eliminating susceptibility to cutting or puncturing hazards often experienced during towing, deployment, and retrieval operations. Mid proposes to develop a custom hose which includes a layer of protection to significantly minimize, if not eliminate, the risk of cutting the hose and maintain the vibration attenuation properties. The proposed solution has the potential to meet all the goals of this topic at a cost similar to the current hoses used in the VIM."

The topic description continues to define some of the key attributes of the Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable (QSFP+) transceiver module that the Navy sponsor, and the herein proposed work, aims to ruggedize. A critical problem inherent in the available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) QSFP+, and related transceiver (TRX) modules, E\/O connectors and interfaces, is that none of them are designed and manufactured per relevant military standards; and therefore, all of them will suffer routine and frequent failures in environments that induce high vibration, radiation and\/or broad thermal operating conditions. These failures must be mitigated via a rugged-by-design and manufacture, drop-in replaceable QSFP+ TRX module alternative. the Nanomatronix team seeks to develop the Ruggedized QSFP+, or &apos;R-QSFP+&apos; product line specifically for harsher environment high bandwidth applications, including aircraft, naval craft and spacecraft per relevant standards."

        "abstract": "The Submarine Force is phasing out conventional optical periscopes in favor of digital sensor masts that electronically transmit video to the Control Center. Digital imagery still suffers from distortions due to atmospheric turbulence caused by humidity and temperature gradients near the ocean surface. While systems for turbulence correction exist, they have largely focused on static scenes and rely on precise image alignment of multiple frames to produce clean images. However, submarine imagery comes from a moving camera capturing a moving target, in a moving scene making alignment infeasible, and results must be available quickly (i.e., the system cannot wait for multiple frames before producing output). Therefore, existing mechanisms for correcting blur and loss of contrast cannot be effectively applied to turbulence correction for submarine imagery. To address these shortcomings, we propose Turbulence Mitigation, Error Reduction, and Increased Contrast (TURMERIC), a software system that uses deep learning to correct for atmospheric turbulence in imagery such that watchstanders and automated detection algorithms can optimally detect surface contacts. Specifically, TURMERIC uses a generative adversarial network (GAN), a powerful new deep learning architecture, to intelligently de-blur and enhance the contrast of photonics mast imagery using only a single frame."

It is possible that the internal atmospheric pressure could be increased up to 5X during a DISSUB scenario; currently, there is no method to lower that internal pressure. ADA Technologies proposes a method to decrease that internal pressure, thereby increasing the chance of survival by crewmembers. The Decompression of Internal Pressure of Submarine ATmosphere (DIPSAT) System will over-pressurize and subsequently vent gas from the DISSUB. The DIPSAT system will have the ability to be man-powered, in the case of no available onboard electricity. The proposed effort will leverage the high-pressure gas storage and delivery system design experience of the ADA team with the experience of the Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems division, as well as the extensive experience of DOER Marine Operations, an underwater technology company.

        "abstract": "The US Navy has determined that the ability to decompress distressed submarines (DISSUB) before crewmembers are rescued could improve the survival rate. For various reasons, its likely that a DISSUB that ends up on the bottom of the ocean will have an internal pressure above 1 atm. If decompression of the DISSUB can be achieved before the crewmembers are rescued, this can significantly decrease, decompression requirements and the risk of oxygen toxicity, nitrogen narcosis, and decompression sickness.To achieve this, Air Squared is proposing the development of a Seawater Flooded Scroll Compressor with a Tribrid Power system (SFSC-TP). The seawater flooded scroll compression system, will utilize sea water, to seal, lubricate and cool the compression process, in order to compress the DISSUB internal atmosphere and discharge it external to the DISSUB. The SFSC-TP will be autonomously powered independent of the shipboard electrical power through the use of three sources, this includes stored energy in the ships high-pressure air banks using a scroll air expander, seawater pressure using a scroll hydro turbine, and a self-contained battery. This will allow the SFSC-TP to deliver a comprehensive solution which can provide maximum decompression depending on available power sources, DISSUB depth, and decompression volume."

        "abstract": "Future Navy pulsed power systems, including lasers, directed energy systems, and railguns will require short-term prime power sources exceeding currently available shipboard capacity. Battery systems are being developed to support this peak power demand on an as-needed basis. Batteries can be charged over a relatively long period of time at low power from an existing AC or DC bus. Ripple current is a primary factor of merit for battery charging, as it contributes to internal heating, and accelerates degradation of the battery cells. Ultra-low ripple, variable-rate charging and voltage maintenance of these batteries will require compact, efficient, EMI-tolerant, and reliable battery chargers capable of operation over a range of current, voltage, and power settings. Under this SBIR effort, Diversified Technologies, Inc. will develop and deliver a Compact, Ultra-Low Ripple, 1000V, 35 kW Battery Charger with a power density greater than 3 MW\/m3. Variable-parameter output modes will provide charging and battery maintenance over a range of commanded current, voltage, and power profile conditions, and will include a low-power maintenance discharge capability."

Our research will build on this foundation to establish methodologies for integrating cybersecurity analysis.Our research approach will address the shortfalls identified by the topic to achieving the detailed level of data collection necessary to model and integrate relevant system attributes to enable a unified cybersecurity analysis platform. Our engineers and system modelers have developed and deployed an efficient data collection strategy that allows for rapid consumption of information housed in non-electronic and physical data stores. This strategy has been used to generate models of more than 18,000 end-to-end architectural elements, mission threads and interface requirements. We will research ways to expand this methodology to integrate additional cybersecurity relevant analytics within a unified, data concordant model."

        "abstract": "There are many challenges associated with delivering new capabilities to a Naval Combatants. Because Combat Systems can apply lethal effects, ensuring the interoperability of the components and applications that comprise Naval combat systems such as AEGIS is a critical and essential task. Introducing a new capability or updating a single subsystem requires testing and certification of the subsystem as well as the system as a whole. This alone is expensive and time consuming. But, the reality is that by adding or updating one subsystem, other subsystems must also be updated. This additional activity only increases the cost and time it takes to deliver capabilities to the warfighter. SimVentions offers to define a new methodology, based on the FACE Technical Standard and software tools, to move AEGIS interface and data model specifications forward by specifying semantic representations, allow interoperability issues to be discovered earlier, and promote reuse by isolating code changes within the architecture. This will facilitate the introduction of new capability while allowing legacy subsystems to operate without change and migrate forward to FACE conformance as their Program allows. All of this will combine to reduce the effort and cost associated with developing, integrating, testing, and certifying tactical software."

VIStology proposes to develop a Semantic data Architecture for Future-proof Extensible integration (SAFE) approach that will leverage semantic technologies to allow adding and maintaining new components at runtime without affecting the legacy systems. Proposed semantically-rich protocols facilitate automating reasoning about the legacy and new components, which will make systems gracefully handle the addition of new components and data attributes, and to avoid undesirable side effects. Effectively, SAFE will enable capability upgrades at any time, regardless of the software version of the systems and components present on a ship. Instead of replacing entire software suite, individual modules of the combat management system can be deployed one at a time. To test the proposed approach, VIStology will work closely with its partner, which already provided a concrete use case that would drive the R&amp;D effort in Phase I, but also be used to assess usability, correctness and efficiency of SAFE. This collaboration will guarantee that any product developed out of this effort will address real needs of its potential users, and that SAFE improves the efficiency and the quality of the acquisition of DoD systems."

This proposal leverages Skayls first generation sematic-aware integration compiler, and seeks to research, test and quantify further developments to this technology including the development of techniques for real-time signal and state management. This innovation will provide a more efficient and more cost-effective integration solution that can be dynamically reconfigured as requirements, systems, and interfaces (and even as real-time operational conditions) change. During the SBIR, Skayl will identify fundamental concepts relating to signals, state and behavior as related to the needs of combat systems and formally document them in a data model. Skayl will then develop metrics &amp; approaches for testing real-time integration in order to provide quantitative results of increases in efficiency as well as identifying areas for further development and improvement."

These developments to date have been targeted in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR), however with ever increasing threat sophistication there is a real need to expand the wavelength regime of these countermeasures to more diverse wavelengths, in particular the long-wave infrared (LWIR). Forward Photonics has had remarkable success using its proprietary wavelength beam combination (WBC) technology in the mid-infrared regime (45 m) with QCLs. Forward Photonics mid-wave infrared (MWIR) laser capable of producing &gt; 25 W in CW operation by using WBC to combine the outputs of individual high power QCLs. Forward Photonics is proposing a technical approach to construct a 100 W LWIR system based on WBC of high power QCLs."

The system is composed of multiple quantum cascade laser modules which are spectrally combined into a single output beam. In order to simplify system construction, the system is designed to operate with a small number of active elements engineered for high atmospheric transmission. This is made possible by the use of already demonstrated high efficiency quantum cascade wafer designs and a new, on-chip phase-locking architecture to significantly scale the output power per module. The proposed effort will both experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-concept laser module and explore initial system design for broadband spectral coverage"

This algorithm will be developed using a two-tiered approach. First create a large database of optimized PIPs spanning many different threat scenarios by using global optimization. Second use this database to train a neural network to create optimized PIPs in real time.

Current launch and recovery systems for boat bays are designed for specific craft, not allowing for damage-free interface when new or modified craft are developed. According to the SBIR description, detailed interface requirements between craft and launch and recovery systems are not established to prevent craft damage. MAPC will design a concept ABLARS which consists of a main ramp, extendable ramp, and a capture carriage. The main ramp runs the length of the boat bay and is installed parallel to the boat bay deck. The main ramp features keel rollers similar to those found on a commercial boat trailer along the centerline, and bunks on either side of centerline installed on pivoting arms."

ADAM is made possible by the rapid advances and reduced costs of Personal Computer (PC) controlled spectrum analyzers and Software Defined Radio (SDR) transceivers and will have a footprint on the order of a square foot or less. ADAMs small footprint and low cost will allow deployment of multiple units close to a target facility by overt or covert means."

        "abstract": "The capture, refinement, and sharing of knowledge across military occupations is key to readiness and effectiveness. Existing approaches to create, disseminate, and curate the needed content in a user-friendly and rapid way are not usable on mobile platforms and require training or advanced skills. We propose the Rapid Mobile Authoring Toolkit (R-MAT) solution as a mobile tool for content authoring using native mobile device features (camera, audio, video, text, drag and drop) and a web-based backend application for publishing, curation and dissemination. R-MAT will provide a simplified mobile version of the core features of modern desktop-based content authoring tools and will emphasize intuitive user interfaces that allow a user to create, organize, and publish content from mobile device platforms. R-MAT will enable subject matter experts from any sector to create effective multi-media content using a mobile device. The R-MAT and backend system will allow simple content creation, intelligent metadata generation for categorization and the &quot;findability&quot; of multimedia assets. R-MAT will provide a capability as a user-centric content authoring tool that simplifies the rapid creation and distribution of content from the experts in the field to military personnel across dispersed operational units to accelerate knowledge transfer and lessons learned."

        "abstract": "Mentoring, demonstrating, and over-the-shoulder performance checks are some of the ways experienced Sailors pass their knowledge to newer Sailors, thereby furthering their growth. These methods are effective for passing knowledge to a particular Sailor or group, but are less effective for ensuring all Sailors have the knowledge, resources, and training they need when they need them. The effective reach and impact of these on-the-job knowledge sharing methods could be vastly increased by capturing experts knowledge in real time, as its being shared, and making it available for mass consumption and benefit. Technologies for achieving this capability exist; the challenges are adapting and integrating those technologies to support high quality, easily captured, and easily consumed knowledge products. To address these challenges, SoarTech proposes the tablet-based Proficiency Amplified through Knowledge Sharing and Support for Informal Teaching (PASSIT) tool for on-the-job, high-quality multi-media expert-knowledge capture. PASSIT will support on-the-job knowledge capture and sharing across a wide range of operations and maintenance work communities. In this Phase I effort, we will design an initial prototype based on the knowledge sharing needs and practices of two work communities, the Sonar Technician Surface (STG) and petroleum processing industries."

Sonalysts solution, the Peer-to-Peer Information and Education Resource (PIER), will increase warfighter effectiveness by providing sailors with the opportunity to learn from each other via a simple app-like authoring tool. PIER will allow the Navy to increase the distribution of tacit knowledge resident throughout the fleet and thereby capitalize on the collective intelligence of its men and women. PIER will be a highly usable wizard-like authoring system that will allow Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to quickly, efficiently, and effectively develop a variety of performance supports. The PIER architecture will be designed to function on a range of traditional and mobile computing platforms. Robust design patterns will allow SMEs to document their lessons learned via specified knowledge-transfer documents. The PIER system will help SMEs to identify an appropriate job aid and then lead the SME through a documentation process. Bootstrapping questions and an analysis of the content will be used to define metadata tags and the information product will be placed in a temporary local data store. The chain of command can use vetting tools to assess the product and authorize its release."

        "abstract": "Pacific Science &amp; Engineering Group (PSE) proposes to design, develop, and demonstrate a web application for novice video content creators that we call Sailor2Sailor (S2S). S2S will be designed based on knowledge gained through interactions with potential users, lessons learned and best practice in the knowledge creation domain, and findings within the training and cognitive science literature. The S2S user interface design will be guided by human factors principles, ensuring that it is effective, easy to understand, and use.Once developed, S2S will be a powerful, usable web application for sailors to rapidly capture and share practical, hands-on, operationally-relevant knowledge with fellow sailors. S2S will invigorate Navy training by augmenting the more traditional schoolhouse and on the job training activities with highly specific video content created by sailors for sailors. Traditional formal and informal training support the development of needed, valuable knowledge, but is often limited in terms of accessibility and currency of content. Furthermore, invaluable location- and context-specific knowledge held by sailors is not being captured and disseminated efficiently and effectively.S2S will change the way sailors share and consume knowledge. Ultimately, greater knowledge dissemination will lead to improved collaboration and performance, and reduced inefficiencies around the Fleet."

        "abstract": "It has been recognized for over a decade that robotic and autonomous systems will become a major component of the US military warfighting capability. In working to create flexible, robust robotic capabilities, engineers have found that developing and testing these systems carry unique challenges that arent easily solved through the application of traditional engineering tools and processes. One area that has great potential, however, to enhance robustness, reduce costs, and shorten development time is the application of engineering modeling and simulation (M&amp;S). In this program, QS proposes to create ANVEL Coastal: Autonomous System Simulation Tool for Land\/Sea Systems. ANVEL Coastal will be a multi-domain engineering M&amp;S tool specifically built to support the development, testing, and validation of robotic systems that operate in land, sea, or in the transition between them. The system will build upon an existing ground-focused autonomous system M&amp;S tool, Autonomous Navigation Virtual Environment Laboratory (ANVEL), which is widely used by the DoD and other organizations in its ground robotics efforts. ANVEL Coastal will provide a desktop simulation capability that can be adapted and used in a variety of configurations to support development and testing of autonomous sea\/land\/transitional systems."

        "abstract": "Increased performance requirements of high-power or high-frequency electronics require novel thermal management materials. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) enhance performance of polymer-based electrically-insulating thermal interface materials (TIMs). This work will incorporate BNNTs into common micro-particle polymer composites to increase thermal transport between particles. Thermal impedance within TIMs is dominated by resistivity of the polymer which holds the thermally-conductive particles together in the matrix. Typically, inter-particulate space is 20% of interfaces volume. A multi-scale, bottoms-up approach to fabricating the filler material is expected to increase the thermal conductivity of many TIMs to above 10 W\/mK. TIMs based on epoxy, cyanoacrylate, silicone, silicone oil, nylon multipolymer thermoplastic, and polytetrafluoroethylene matrices will be explored. Preliminary in-house work already dramatically increased thermal conductivity to nearly 6 W\/mK in thermoplastics doped with BNNTs, implying an increase in inter-particle conductivity of ~20X. The TIMs produced in this study will be characterized for in- and through-plane thermal conductivity, and filler material development will be aided by scanning electron microscope imaging and surface area analysis of the densified powders to determine optimal ratios of components. The TIMs fabricated will be applicable within components, and as adhesives, pastes, top-side coatings, substrates, underfills, gap fillers, gap pads, and laminates."

        "abstract": "Electronic devices in general, and high power, high-speed electronics in particular, generate substantial amounts of heat that must be removed in order for the device to continue to function. Finned metal blocks and heat pipes assist in removing the heat from individual components and circuit boards. Soft, possibly adhesive elastomers help fill the small gaps between the component packaging and the heat sink, thereby greatly improving the quality of the interface through which heat can flow. Since the thermal conductivity of elastomers is rather poor, they are filled with fine particles of a good thermal conductor. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has long been a material of choice for the filler, since it combines outstanding thermal conductivity with a low dielectric constant. Recently, polymers with small, exfoliated BN sheets have demonstrated tremendous increases in thermal conductivity, primarily due to improved alignment of the hBN in the direction of the heat flow. However, the reported methods of alignment are often not practicable in a manufacturing context, and the polymers are not generally suitable for thermal interface materials (TIMs). TDA will address these issues with a low-cost manufacturing process built around polymers that have long found to be satisfactory for TIMs."

The overall goal of the SBIR program is to develop a usable product with the following characteristics: robust to vibration and abrasion, non-permanent bonding, high dielectric strength, and high thermal conductance. Our approach will yield a conformable TIM with a thermal conductivity &gt;20 W\/m2-K and dielectric constant 1 mm) without degradation of performance. For the Phase I Base effort, we will produce, characterize, and demonstrate BNNT\/CNF TIMs with thermal footprints as large as 8 cm2. The Phase II will focus of refinement of production, scalability, and evaluation using military standard test procedures as well as development of a thermal paste based upon the composition identified during the Phase I effort."

        "abstract": "Automated planners have been adopted as key decision support tools for mission planning in a wide range of domains, such as maritime Mine CounterMeasures (MCM). However, the models that power these planners, such as models of capabilities, tactics, environment, and goals, must currently be hand-codeda tedious and slow process that makes model maintenance impractical for highly dynamic domains where models must be constantly updated. Further, the hand-coding approach does not scale to scenarios with increasing numbers of heterogeneous unmanned assets, such as unmanned underwater vehicles, where their sensing and autonomous capabilities can vary widely and change far more rapidly than larger manned systems. In these scenarios, MCM operators cannot rely on automated planners to have adequate knowledge of assets and how best to tactically employ them because the rate at which this knowledge can be hand-coded is insufficient to keep up with the tempo of change. These limitations ultimately result in suboptimal mission performance and underutilization of unmanned assets. To overcome these challenges, the SoarTech team proposes MineApprentice, a machine learning system that incrementally and continually acquires both asset performance models and tactical planning knowledge from interaction with operators as they use existing MCM planning software (e.g., MEDAL-EA\/MineNet Tactical)."

        "abstract": "The current exponential growth of energy consumption in supercomputers and data centers has become an ecological and economical problem for simple reasons of power delivery, power dissipation and heat removal. To go on with the exponential growth in the use of information we need to continue reducing the energy required to handle each bit. This reduction, however, becomes an increasingly harder problem. We propose a new strategy for the more efficient cooling of electronics, where cooling is achieved through efficient anti-Stokes spontaneous emission from quantum dots and low-dimensional structures embedded into a waveguide structure and excited by external laser emission. The physical mechanism is that of laser cooling and requires quantum dots with very efficient anti-Stokes emission. Various designs of the cooling device are explored to find the most efficient way for spontaneous emission extraction to prevent reabsorption and reheating in electronics. The geometry of a single device allows the fabrication of a planar structure for cooling 3D stacks of electronics, where power dissipation and heat removal becomes the most severe problem for the difficulty in designing effective heat sinks. The concept provides a means for implementation of such heat sinks as cooling planes compatible with 3D stacks of electronics."

        "abstract": "Optical cooling is a unique and promising cooling method capable of cooling to cryogenic temperatures in the absence of moving parts, noise, or vibration. Only a laser is used to pump in light; a semiconducting material upconverts this energy to reject higher energy photons producing a net cooling effect. Optical cooling is contrasted by mechanical systems, such as Stirling cryocoolers which can be loud, prone to vibration, and rapidly decrease in efficiency with thermal lift. Optical cooling may also be able to scale to the thermal load as the cooling power is linearly proportional to the laser power. And unlike thermoelectric Peltier coolers, optical coolers may be able to achieve temperatures of &lt; 10 K.Mainstream will overcome poor efficiencies of conventionally optical coolers by improving each of the components of the optical cooling device to improve the quantum yield, film integration, and emitted photon rejection. In Phase I, Mainstream will demonstrate the viability of optical cooling via quantum dot anti-Stokes upconversion to generate net cooling. In Phase II, the integration of the optical cooler with a specified device will be designed, fabricated, and tested leading to immediate commercialization."

Metron proposes to build an MDANM tool that aims to maximally leverage all available information sources and computes the directional noise field and associated array gain in an accurate and efficient manner. One of the key differentiators of the proposed product is its ability to adaptively adjust the underlying physics models and input data sources based on the use case parameters to provide proper tradeoff between speed and accuracy. A second differentiator is the combined use of Monte Carlo methods with real time shipping information to improve shipping noise estimates. The framework components of MDANM will be based on feedback from stakeholders and end-users for output to the next-generation Submarine Tactical Decision Aid (STDA). Enhancing the reliability and accuracy of detection modeling will lead to an increase the utility of TDAs, and allow operators to make better strategic and\/or tactical recommendations."

        "abstract": "Wargaming plays a critical role in the modern military, both as a decision support tool for command and control centers and as a training tool for developing the future force. In both of these applications it is valuable to have access to highly skilled automated actors. In a decision support context, this facilitates fast, high fidelity simulations with a variety of possible battlefield conditions. In a training context, this supports interactive learning tools and allows commanders to hone their skills through competition with difficult opponents.Historically, Artificial Intelligence agents that can match or beat expert human performance have been limited to turn-based games. However, due to the success of IBMs Deep Blue system at Chess, and more recently, DeepMinds AlphaGo system at Go, the latest research has begun to investigate if the techniques employed by these systems can be improved to achieve expert-level performance at less well-defined, real-time games.To manage the fundamental complexities that military-domain AI systems face, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation proposes the Framework for Intelligent Simulation Command with Hierarchically Embedded Reinforcement Learning (FISCHER). FISCHER will leverage the latest developments in Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning to provide a wargaming artificial intelligence that can perform at a humanlike level."

        "abstract": "Knowledge-Based Systems Incorporated (KBSI) proposes Simulation in Behaviors and Decisions (SinBaD) in response to the Navy SBIR Warfighting Chess Games and Pieces (topic number N181-083). We will demonstrate proof-of-concept simulation components that have the capability to pit smart red\/gray forces against smart blue forces to aid development of timely and effective decision support tools. This proposed capability will provide a service that is available for decision support tools to suggest modifications to current plans and predict future outcomes contextualized to a specific situation. Our demonstration scenario will be a lab-based 3-on-3 game in which both the red\/gray commander and blue commander have three platoons with an objective of securing an area of interest. To increase our understanding, we will vary the parameters of the game to explore the differences in strategies. For example, the differences between an amphibious operation to secure a beachhead as opposed to one in a dense, urban environment to secure critical infrastructure. The Phase I results will demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for an operationally relevant toolset and decision support instrument. The Phase I results will also identify metrics to verify performance, and model normalization across simulation systems necessary to reduce technical risk."

        "abstract": "Modern hearing protection devices (HPDs) often include electronic hear-through technology that helps to preserve or enhance the users auditory situational awareness (ASA). Restoration of ASA has removed one of the largest barriers to HPD adoption. However, because HPDs alter the shape of the ear or ear canal, they distort the acoustic cues used by the brain to localize the source of a sound. Thus, there is a need to both measure the effect HPDs have on sound localization and to train HPD users to localize sounds while wearing their HPDs. However, current sound localization systems are essentially fixed installations that are expensive to set up and difficult use. A new, portable, and inexpensive measurement-training system is needed. Creare proposes to develop an Auditory Situational Awareness Station (ASA Station) that combines innovative sound projection technologies and user interfaces to maximize training effectiveness and efficiency in a lightweight, easy-to-use, and portable package. In the Phase I Base we will demonstrate the core ASA Station innovations in a proof-of-concept system. In Phase II, we will develop a complete prototype solution covering the full range operational specifications."

PASAT, using a menu-based computer interface, will enable user-friendly setup, calibration, and operation by either trainer or trainee, and provide performance feedback during training exercises on accuracy and response time metrics. Using custom LabVIEW software, training will be enabled with both open ear and various HPDs and TCAPS, with on-screen comparison of results. A computerized automatic gain control innovation will maintain one of at least 3 preselected signal\/masking-noise ratios sufficiently above ambient noise encountered in training environments. Options for various military-relevant, pre-calibrated WAV files of signals and noises will be selectable by the trainer\/trainee. PASAT will include a 15-degree arcuate separation between signal speakers in azimuth\/elevation, with speaker array mounted on a collapsible, portable halo-style frame. Phase I includes a subcontract to Virginia Tech&apos;s Auditory Systems Lab to enable its full-scale DRILCOM ASA test system to be used as a springboard resource. The Principal Investigators have extensive experience with ASA testing\/training, having pioneered objective measurement of ASA performance in 2007, and thereafter developed instrumentation\/protocols for its laboratory measurement and trainee skills acquisition."

        "abstract": "The research objective of the proposed work is to develop a concept for a feed-forward control (FFC) hardware, algorithms, and multi-physics-based models to allow real-time tracking of powder bed layer variability and corresponding laser processing parameter compensation to improve the quality of laser fusion-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) parts. The FFC concept is designed to compensate for the systematic physical property variabilities of the powder bed layer arising from the non-uniformity of thermal evolution for the AM build and recoat layer powder. This includes the characterization of systematic layer thickness variability that is caused by splatter, molten particle ejects, denudation zones, and the previous layer surface roughness. The proposed FFC compensation algorithms build upon the predictions of multi-physics models in order to minimize defects and the non-uniformity of microstructure, which arise from the inconsistency of the melt-pool shape and its solidification behavior. The parameter compensation is designed to predict the current, relevant information using off-the-shelf hardware and data-reduction procedures that have been demonstrated. The Phase I will refine these procedures and the hardware utilization for real-time FFC application. It will also specify a range of parameter variables for the purpose of model development, system verification, and technology validation."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for cross-domain transition goggles with an integrated, illuminated display, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISS) proposes to develop new Transition Wide-Angle Goggles with Integrated Illuminated Display (TWIGIID) based on an innovative design that uniquely integrates an ellipsoidal visor with narrowband reflective coating, free-form anamorphic plastic-molded optics, and high-resolution miniature OLED microdisplays. The use of ellipsoidal reflectors provides wide field-of-view (FOV) distortion-free collimation; anamorphic optics to stretch and reconfigure the OLED image into 3-times higher horizontal resolution; and free-form surface design to correct the geometrical distortion over the wide FOV. The use of ellipsoidal visor lens and miniaturized projection optics enables the size of lap swim goggles. Water-proof sealing of microdisplay and electronics allows seamless transition between underwater and above-water operation. Use of a passive coating and purging with dry gas enables the small goggles to be cleared if flooded with water, to equalize pressure as needed, and to be fog-free. In Phase I, ISS will develop a detailed design of TWIGIID, analyze performance, and specify procedure and hardware for water clearing, equalizing, and de-fogging. In Phase II, ISS will fabricate, lab test, evaluate form-fit and function, revise design, and fabricate prototypes based on Navys feedback."

        "abstract": "Current military dive masks are relatively bulky and do not function well with night vision equipment or weapons because of a large forward projection from the face. The additional size and complications of an integrated display for situational awareness and augmented reality exacerbates these problems. A versatile, compact and easy to stow goggle system with an integrated illuminated display that can function effectively in all aspects of air-sea-land operations would have immediate advantages but also poses serious design challenges. Creative Microsystems Corporation (CMC) proposes to design, develop and transition the Cross-Domain Integrated Goggle (CDIG) to answer this challenge. CMC will leverage its existing technology and experience in wearable displays, near to eye displays and dive equipment development to bring to the Navy a new approach to eye\/face covering that can do all these jobs well. The proposed design can be particularly cost effective and weight reducing by replacing four or more pieces of special operator or Navy combat diver equipment. Commercial applications of the resulting design phase and its implementation can enable a wide range of swimming, scuba diving, industrial safety and first responder products that incorporate a display function."

        "abstract": "The U.S. Navy has a strong need to reduce the Radar Cross Section (RCS) of submarine masts such as the OE-538 in order to maintain stealth during high data rate communications. The submarine mast RCS is compounded by multi-path off the sea which tends to cause increased and persistent back-scattering over a wide range of aspect angles and frequencies. To avoid the high cost of reshaping the mast, the only viable technique to reduce the RCS is to utilize radio frequency (RF) absorber. The RF absorber needs to be judiciously applied to avoid degrading the communication signals while reducing the RCS. Toyon proposes to evaluate the feasibility of its patterned absorber for application in reducing the RCS of the Navy&apos;s submarine masts. Toyons patterned absorber can be applied like wall-paper and covered with a protective layer to withstand the harsh operating environment of a submarine mast. The thin patterned circuit layer consists of passive resistive and conductive elements that can be readily varied over a surface (i.e. tuned during manufacturing) using standard circuit board etching techniques. Toyon will use proven computer models to design absorbers specific to this application and then validate the predictions by testing a prototype."

        "abstract": "US Navy submarines use metallic masts such as Lockheeds OE-538\/BRC Multifunction Communication Mast Antenna System to communicate. Although these are highly effective, a main drawback to their use is that they can be detected by enemy radar. A prospective solution would be the application of material over existing masts that can be tuned to keep any desired band open for communication while maximally absorbing all other frequencies. This material must be environmentally stable to temperature\/pressure changes, salt corrosion, and humidity. Additionally, since the mast assembly cannot be removed, the coating\/material must be applied on the submarine. Luna proposes a multilayer adhesive appliqu, with different sheets tuned to specific open frequency bands. The individual layers will contain tunable fillers and\/or structures to maximally absorb unwanted frequencies while retaining the desired frequency band open. With slight modification to the formulation, the appliqu can be tuned to different open frequency bands. Protective coatings will be applied to the sheets to achieve desired marine environmental protection. For the Phase I program Luna will combine experimental simulations, material synthesis, and radar cross-section\/absorption testing, with the primary goal of demonstrating feasibility of tuning performance to the open frequency bands."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a High Dynamic Range Multi-Carrier Amplifier, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new High Dynamic Range Multi-Carrier Amplifier with Automated Integrated Interference Mitigation (HAWAII), based on integrating POCs interference mitigation technology with state-of-the-art (SOTA) solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs). POC interference mitigation innovations built into HAWAII include: tunable filters and predistortion to linearize the amplifier and reduce intermodulation interference, and an interference canceller to provide simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) capability. As a result, this system supports hopping and multi-carrier waveforms across the entire HF\/VHF\/UHF bands, which directly addresses the PMW\/A-170 requirements for integration with the Digital Modular Radio (DMR) and the High Frequency Over-the-Horizon (HFORCE) waveform. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of HAWAII, designing and developing a concept architecture to address high individual carrier power variations and mitigate the resulting intermodulation interference, reaching technology readiness level (TRL) 3. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and demonstrate a prototype system reaching TRL-5."

        "abstract": "In response to the N181-088 SBIR solicitation (&quot;High Dynamic Range Multi-Carrier Amplifier&quot;), MaXentric proposes EMBARC (Efficient Multi-carrier Broadband Amplifier for Radio Communication) to overcome the challenges of multi-carrier, multi-channel amplification. EMBARC supports up to 36 concurrent carriers from with 100W of output power for VHF and UHF systems (2MHz - 3 GHz). Due to the nature of multi-carrier signals (high peak to average power), EMBARC utilizes intelligent supply management as well as Adagio (multi-carrier enabler) coupled with GreenAmp envelope tracking to provide the highest efficiency, keeping the overall SWaP to a minimum. High linearity is achieved with our real-time predistorter MaXPAL. In addition, EMBARC integrates a coupler system to enable future-leaning STaR platforms. To enable smooth integration with existing and future platforms, EMBARC is designed to interface with the digital modular radios (DMR). In Phase I, the analysis and design of EMBARC will be performed through simulations along with relevant trade studies. The effort includes a feasibility demonstration of EMBARC. Phase II efforts involve the implementation, fabrication, and system integration of EMBARC, resulting in a hardware prototype-based design methodology and findings of Phase I."

The innovative system will enhance the individual data elements by establishing relationships on ingest. MERIT will stage the data, prepare the data for routing, tag the data, and provision data for multi-domain analytics and subsequent rapid information product dissemination across multiple security enclaves. Techniques to be investigated include topic modeling, neural nets, deep learning, recommendation engines, and semantic classifiers. Our long-term vision is that MERIT will (1) ingest, route, correlate, and store data, to build a knowledge graph for all domains which will provide a holistic view for each permission level while ensuring strong governance and security to prevent loss or incorrect routing of data, and (2) help the Warfighter aggregate content from multiple DoD sources with the best technology and performance, which will help DCGS-N successfully manage data across the enterprise."

The payload architecture will support a wide range of waveforms using a high performance Software Defined Radio (SDR) and an on board library. Navy waveforms such as Link-16, Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) SATCOM waveforms\/protocols could include the Integrated Waveform, Integrated Broadcast Service, or Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB). On the NGSO interface, Innoflight will design a modular interface that can support a wide variety of host buses, physical interfaces, and communications protocols.For this effort, Innoflight will implement the Link-16 waveform with network wide monitoring capability, selective monitoring capability, and message transmission capability."

        "abstract": "Diverse communication paths are needed to connect Military Operations Centers (MOC) to tactical radios in the field without requiring modifications to the radios on ships, airplanes, and other platforms. We propose a communications payload, hosted on a LEO satellite, that has a wide-band deployable antenna. This combination consists of our solution to provide a Rapid Integration Tactical Communications Payload (RITCP). The communications payload can communicate with existing and future tactical radios and pass HAIPE encrypted data to the host commercial SATCOM system to be relayed to the appropriate MOC where it can be decrypted, and an encrypted response be sent back through the HAIPE encrypted commercial SATCOM system and then back through the Vulcan NSR SDR to the appropriate tactical radio. There are a wide range of waveforms are possible for the NSR system to host. For example; MIL-STD-188-181B, MIL-STD-188-165A, Link-22, Link-16, Adaptive Networking Wide bandwidth Waveform (ANW2), Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), P25 (Project 25), Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW), Solder Radio Waveform (SRW) and Common Data Link (CDL)."

        "abstract": "CesiumAstro proposes a software-reconfigurable and mechanically adaptable tactical communications payload (SR-ATP). The payload is envisioned as a modular system that can be added to commercial satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), extending Navys communication systems. Military assets would send\/receive data through the host satellites gateway link, where SR-ATP would exchange this data through its interface with the host. From there, SR-ATP would modulate\/demodulate the data using a selected military waveform and transmit\/receive the data through its RF front-end module (FEM) and the antenna. In this design, each tactical payload is composed of a common processing module and one or more FEMs and the antennas. The common module has an FPGA-based communication processor, Ethernet connection, memory, and a power conditioning unit. For the FEMs, Cesium will develop two RF personalities, one for UHF operations and one for L-band operations. In addition, Cesium will develop a payload bus that would support the modular payload and allow for a variety of integration options with the host satellite. Using the core module, one or more bus units, and one or more RF personalities, Navy would be able to quickly assemble payloads of various complexities and integrate them on a host satellite."

To mitigate this problem, SimVentions proposes to create a Resource Utilization Prediction\/Planning Analysts Resource Tool (RUPART) that will equip simulation integrators and scenario planners with the ability to analyze simulation architectures, quantify network processing time, and identify the cause of network latencies ahead of simulation runtime.Through the collection and analysis of historical data that captures message traffic, as well as cataloging hardware and network characteristics, SimVentions proposes unique simulation architecture models and algorithms that provide a computational backend for a rich visualization component that provides predictive insight. This will equip scenario planners and integration engineers with a simulation tool to predict runtime and network resource loading; guiding scenario modifications, and network resources allocation, thereby ensuring successful completion of test scenarios.This will result in successful integration of BMDS elements and the verification of MDA test objectives.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

MDA Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) hardware and software components are developed independently from one another in isolation, so the computational impact of one component on the other is not initially known. Care must be taken in scenario and architecture design, since executing large-scale simulation federations can be computationally and network intensive, sometimes producing invalid results.A Resource Utilization Prediction and Planning Tool for Complex Simulations will enable analysts to estimate the execution run-time and network loading requirements for simulation scenarios on given architectures. By learning the scenario features that drive resource loading, this technology will assist analysts in designing and configuring valid and accreditable scenarios subject to time and resource constraints. An embedded optimization framework will facilitate automated batch scheduling for Monte-Carlo experiments by determining the optimal subset of scenarios to execute given input parameters of interest and resource constraints.WarpIV Technologies, Inc. proposes a general purpose, configurable, adaptable, and highly customizable solution to enable resource utilization prediction and planning for complex simulations. This solution will leverage the unique mathematical optimization algorithms and M&amp;S capabilities of the WarpIV Kernel.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

It is based on a new design incorporating intelligent log data analysis to explore data, detect anomalous occurrences, select analysis schemes, and assess results. Specifically, RIDDLE will use decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, nearest neighbors, and ensemble classification to perform both root cause crash analysis and data selection for logging with sufficient fidelity to diagnose problems and understand complex simulation events. As a result, RIDDLE directly addresses the MDAs requirements for efficiently logging simulation data based on occurrence\/predicted occurrence of the simulator and the simulated events of interest. In Phase I, POC will design and develop the RIDDLE concept and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, reaching an anticipated TRL of 3, and an incremental development plan for Phases II\/III. In Phase II, POC will develop a prototype for intelligent data logging capable of being tested by simulation engineers in a run-for record reaching an anticipated TRL of 5.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

        "abstract": "MDA M&amp;S systems generate a significant amount of simulation data, but correspondingly incur significant use of computing resources to process it. To avoid system instability and the introduction of operational latencies within these systems, only a minimal set of log data can be collected.MDA requires an intelligent data logging solution for their modeling &amp; simulation (M&amp;S) systems that reduces runtime and resource usage (CPU, memory, network, and storage) and collects relevant data, rather than blindly logging data in a best-effort fashion.We propose developing an intelligent, adaptive data-logging platform that will adjust to match the dynamic situation and the analysts needs. Our platform will continually collect and asynchronously buffer high-fidelity data (by sampling at high rate) in circular in-memory caches. This ensures low latency and high throughput while minimizing the impact to the application. This data is captured before and after events of interest occur; it will be analyzed to detect anomalies and other events, triggering the logging into permanent-storage of the fine-grain data. The event detection will utilize conditions programmed by users, statistical anomaly-detection techniques, as well as machine learning algorithms (both supervised and unsupervised).Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

        "abstract": "Large federated simulations are inherently complex to design and execute effectively to meet experiment objectives. When running a series of computationally expensive simulations, simulation engineers need to quickly analyze critical events of interest (e.g., time of detection) without being inundated with GBs of irrelevant data. Unfortunately, many critical events are sporadic, so to ensure that no relevant data are missed, data are currently logged at a high fidelity and frequency throughout the simulation run, resulting in up to 250 GB of data for a federated simulation. This amount of data unnecessarily consumes network resources because only a small percentage of the data is relevant to the critical events.We propose a Predictive Adaptable Logger (PAL) that adapts logging settings based on the current likelihood of a pending critical event and the current cost of failing to log data relevant to a critical event of interest. PAL is initialized on historical simulation runs, so it learns what predictive events forecast a critical event. It also reasons about the cost of a missed critical event based on the progress of the simulation run. PAL will minimize the consumption of resources during federated simulation runs while capturing key data needed for analysis.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

This project establishes an IDDL framework that:1. Provides a process whereby users can prioritize data types with a dependency on objectives, specific conditions or scenarios;2. Defines and collects computer performance metrics that impact data logging capacity;3. Includes algorithms that intelligently prioritize data logging dynamically during the simulation and uses machine learning to predict and adapt data logging; and4.

        "abstract": "MDAs Objective-Simulation-Framework (OSF) is a crucial infrastructure for improving the nations BMDS. Albeit successful in enabling high-quality ground tests, OSFs distributed simulations are hampered by hefty data transmissions that could consume up to 50% of the time in a single run. To address this problem, and with the ultimate goal of substantially accelerating OSF transmissions, Accelogic proposes a revolutionary theory of LOSSLESS data-compression especially suited for time-varying resource-scarce environments such as OSFs. Instead of blindly adopting\/improving existing data-compression algorithms, in this project we dig deep into the reasons that limit the impact of compression in OSF, and introduce a very robust technology for properly tackling them. Preliminary assessments show that this technology can provide 6x-60x compressions for a variety of messages in a real OSF operational environment (e.g.,Link-16,states-data). Accelogic has already demonstrated similar aspects of this technology, attaining 62x compressions for the acceleration of log message transmissions in cybersecurity applications. With a world-class multidisciplinary team and the collaboration of Teledyne-Brown-Engineering, Phase-I will render a fully functional prototype that demonstrates the potential of the technology for significantly reducing transmission times and storage requirements in the OSF. We have secured $200,000 in complementary funds for ensuring the deployment of this revolutionary technology.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

        "abstract": "The Missile Defense Agencys (MDA) integrated, layered, Ballistic Missile Defense System utilizes a wide range of networked sensors and ground- and sea-based radars for target detection and tracking. MDA requires advanced data compression techniques to reduce federated and\/or distributed simulation data transmission times and storage capacity requirements for highly complex missile defense simulation and test architectures. Antaras proposed innovation will significantly enhance the current state-of-the-artby providing a scalable, cognitive, lossless, real-time, plug-and-play software-solution for compressing large Modeling and Simulation data. Key components of Antaras innovation are: 1) Unified, cognitive, learning, parallel architecture with multiple compression algorithms to maximize the compression rate of a wide-range of large input data; 2) Highly advanced, real-time Linear Prediction and other innovative compression algorithms for Radar and other RF\/IF data. Antara will perform bench-testing of the algorithms to show the feasibility of the innovation and create Best Known Practices, tutorials, and tools to enable low-cost and rapid integration of the design to the Objective Simulation Framework. The proposed technology will significantly reduce transmission and downlink times enabling more work to be done in a much shorter duration and substantially reduce storage requirements and associated cost of storage on existing and future COTS hardware.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

        "abstract": "BTS Software Solutions proposes a real-time statistical lossless data compression system to conduct run time lossless compression of multimodal data for MDA applications. To realize the real-time process, we will design block based (BB) adaptive Huffman coding, BB-run-length coding, BB-arithmetic coding, and other block based real-time entropy coding algorithms. The system will use statistical features from the current data block and choose the best compressor. The block sizing will be determined by system capabilities from the object simulation framework (OSF). Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of block-based real-time coding methods and effectiveness of the system.By combining with our patented low delay, low complexity, lossless compression framework which exceeded 5:1 compression for MDA telemetry data (roughly twice the best commercial compressors) the system can be further improved in Phase II.The system is designed to be easily portable across platforms, adaptable to parallel architectures for greater speed, and can read from any point (block) in a compressed file- impossible with non-audio\/video compressors. Commercial applications include improving throughput of streaming applications that use numerical data (space, aviation, telematics, gaming), and reducing storage cost and volume.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

More effective data compression techniques compatible with existing infrastructure to reduce data logging path bandwidth and decrease memory and storage are actively sought. To address this need, I-A-I and our partners at the University of California, Davis will work on the design and implementation of a highly parallel multi format suitable compression software suite, accelerated via multi-core and GPU architectures. One particular goal of this project will be the design of a fast general purpose bzip2 like compressor for the GPU, centered around a highly parallel implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler transform. This will enable the user to achieve fast high compression results for different data formats. One advantage of a GPU based algorithm is also the ability to add and upgrade GPU cards at low cost, without making significant changes to existing infrastructure, as per stated goals. Apart from bzip2, I-A-I will work on creating high performance adaptive arithmetic coding and efficient xml interchange implementations, also accelerated on multi-core and GPU architectures. For certain formats like text, XML, and coordinate data, it will be possible to use a combination of the algorithms (e.g. arithmetic coding and bzip2) to produce favorable compression ratios.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

Rugged COTS tapered roller bearings provide the support and define the axes. Resolvers or base mounted laser position sensors will provide position feedback information. Preliminary software and controls will be developed in the Phase I Option. In addition, a gimbal mock-up will be built to check for any mechanical interferences. RHD has an excellent track record of commercializing SBIR technology. Previous SBIR gimbals have been mass-produced for robotic spray finishing.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

        "abstract": "CRM Solutions, Inc proposes to develop a robust, lightweight, low cost spherical seeker gimbal capable of withstanding high omnidirectional acceleration, random vibration, and shock environments. Gimbal designs progressively become more complex and costly as incremental improvements are sought on existing design approaches. The proposed design is a radical departure from the current state-of-the-art in gimbal technology. Through an intense focus on simplicity and ease of manufacture, the proposed gimbal will allow low cost, high rate production for this critical element of a missile interceptor guidance system, while also offering a unique ability to withstand high structural loads. By decoupling the structure of the gimbal and the actuation system, the task of developing both components is simplified. Decreased power consumption and radiation hardening is achieved, in part, by eliminating the use of electromagnetic driver motors. Manufacturing cost is reduced by taking advantage of a novel gimbal structure and mechanical isolation system to reduce the requirement for high precision manufacturing methods and tight geometric tolerance control.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

        "abstract": "Expanded operating environments, evolving interceptor platforms, and increased performance thresholds have given rise to technical challenges to existing seeker gimbal systems that necessitate evolution of the State-of-the-art (SOTA). LoadPaths approach is to develop flexure-based gimbal concepts that maintain or enhance existing system operating abilities such as field of regard, line of sight (LOS) measurement precision, slew rate etc., while evolving the SOTA in a way that both improves the capabilities of the gimbal and enables performance enhancements to the interceptor kill vehicle (KV). The resulting enhanced gimbal systems will require miniaturization, moving parts reduction, high-quality assembly, dense packaging, reliable actuation, and improved seeker platform position measurement precision. The LoadPath Enhanced Gimbal System (LEGS) is an innovative gimbal design approach that is capable of surviving high acceleration and vibration environments.Unlike current state-of-the-art gimbals that require numerous precision machined parts and complicated assembly processes, our approach leverages advanced manufacturing technology to reduce part count, minimize moving parts, integrate damping, improve performance, and enable automated assembly. LEGS technology provides a robust, cutting edge material-based approach to manufacturing and assembly of flexure-based gimbals that has the potential to revolutionize current and future interceptor seeker platforms, while maintaining compatibility with accepted homing guidance practices.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

This accelerometer provides smaller, lighter, more robust, less expensive devices, compatible with known production methodologies. To achieve the required performance a novel material, deposited diamond, (not silicon-based, to achieve the high-g goals) and a novel sensing technology, g force altered variable electron emission, (to achieve the IMU compatible sensitivity) is proposed. This novel sensing mechanism is relatively insensitive to temperature, radiation and other environmental effects such as shock and vibration while reducing error accumulation as well as improvements in Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C). The inertial sensing is performed by the unique utilization of low-cost diamond films, altering the flux of free electrons from a diamond cold cathode emitter as a direct result of g-force change. Scaling for measurements from the kilo-g to the micro-g range achieves an accelerometer superior to existing solid-state technologies. The proposed accelerometers, when integrated, will fit within 2 times smaller packages than the current state of the art IMU packages and while increasing the ruggedness and survivability of accelerometers by a factor of 2 to 3 over current shock and vibration.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

The optoXense-University of South Florida (USF) team proposes a novel adaptive thrust vector control (TVC) architecture forhigh-g propulsion control in advanced missile interceptors that could provide increased mission flexibility and has the potential to increase agility by enabling faster response times. Stability conditions for the overall closed-loop system and bounds on the error signals will be derived. The proposed technology can operate over a wide range of aerodynamic and aerothermal loading conditions, can be compatible with existing propulsion systems, and it is applicable across multiple propulsion platforms. In Phase-I, optoXense will conduct the feasibility study of the proposed adaptive propulsion control technology. In Phase-II, optoXense will expand on Phase I results by producing components and demonstrating technology through prototype testing. optoXense will expand on Phase-II results by optimizing designs for integration into a future MDA missile system.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

        "abstract": "Fielding of advanced missile defense interceptors is strongly dependent upon innovative materials, processes and technologies. One potential area of performance improvement is the nozzle throat of axial thrust systems. An erosion-resistant nozzle throat enables maximum motor efficiency, thereby increasing specific impulse. Tungsten (W) and tantalum carbide (TaC) based materials are being considered for employment as non-eroding nozzle throat materials due to their ultra-high melting temperature and compatibility with highly aluminized propellants. Plasma Processes has developed manufacturing techniques to deposit dense, high strength W and TaC-based materials and successfully demonstrated innovative nozzle designs.Plasma Processes proposes to further advance the maturity of the established technology by investigation an alternative non-eroding nozzle variation that will reduce weight, cost and manufacturing lead-time. The Phase I will involve analytical evaluation of this W-coated CTE matched graphite concept.Analytical evaluation will be followed by deposition experiments, which will involve identification of a suitable diffusion barrier between the W and graphite.The Phase I will be concluded by manufacturing trials to produce a full-scale nozzle.This proposed investigation is directly beneficial to aluminized boost motors across the BMDS, including SM-3 Block IIB (1st, 2nd and 3rd stages), GMD and THAAD.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

Here, we propose the development of algorithms and processes to significantly reduce the burden and cost associated with RCS measurements conducted in support of MDA and other Department of Defense customers. The techniques we propose will reduce the measurement time and storage requirements while allowing the MDA to better utilize the measurement data. Anticipated benefits include faster requirements verification of test articles and more efficient use of the RCS data in simulation environments. Corvid will employ our knowledge regarding MDAs radars and flight-test requirements to satisfy the accuracy needs of these measurements.Corvid has identified seven technologies which will be further developed and applied towards reducing the overall measurement burden. These are classified into the three categories of sampling techniques, data packaging, and extraction methods. Five of the technologies will improve the sampling techniques by reducing the RCS measurement time. One technology will improve the data packaging using a compression technology novel to RCS measurements. Finally, one technology will be used to automate the extraction of the measurement data into a scattering center format.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

In Phase I ANDRO\/Alion team proposes adapting techniques drawn from real-time electronic warfare counter-measure systems, multi-threat response and characterization where direct use of short duration, stepped Linear Frequency Modulated pulses in conjunction with stretch processing detection. These approaches support the objective of maximizing signal to noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing the amount of processed data. The primary goal is to identify and optimize measurement techniques which expedite RCS data acquisition while supporting in-situ data processing in a typical near-field measurement arrangement that maximize the SNR and reduce the amount of averaging over the greatest span of frequencies.This approach comprises a trade study on current pulse widths, bandwidths, round trip times and SNR, study of those parameters to estimate potential improvement in the data acquisition speed as well as component modeling using available software tools such as ANDRO E3Expert and MATLAB. The trade study along with software models of RCS test components will allow a technical assessment of proposed strategies to take place.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

Paraphrasing the topic, this work willdevelop a 3D printing process concept that additively prints a 3D package around a bare semiconductor die where the package is tailored to fit the application. In doing so, we hope to enable domestic packaging manufacture through the flexibility of 3D printing, reducing dependence on non-domestic manufacturing. Further, within the foreign country, it is possible for the part to be counterfeited. 3D printing of a component package around a bare die should allow for the manufacturer to keep the packaging at the same location as the die manufacturing and reduce the risk of counterfeiting.Adv Materials Innovations, teamed with its partners propose to integrate best of breed anti-counterfeit technology with Terrapin Works 3D printed electronics packaging capability to achieve a solution to this problem.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

        "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing, more popularly referred to as 3D printing, has most notably been employed to make structural objects in arbitrary 3D forms from materials including polymers, ceramics, metals and even paper. On a parallel path, Printed Electronics, in particular the Aerosol Jet method, has emerged as a production capable technique for printing all variety of electronic elements and even devices, ranging from simple tracework to embedded passives (ie: resistors) to functional antenna and even fully operational transistor circuits. The purpose of this proposal is to further the convergence of these next generation manufacturing technologies, combining structural printing with functional printing specific to applications in semiconductor packaging. Specifically, the project seeks to develop and demonstrate a method for printing the entirety of a semiconductor package, including the underlying substrate that host a COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) die, 3-dimensional interconnects to and from that die, surrounding circuitry and requisite insulation and encapsulation. The project will assess the applicability of various micro-printing technologies, including Aerosol Jet for precision 2D\/3D deposition of conductors, dielectricsand potentially structure; and micro-stereolithography for relative bulk deposition of structure. The team will work to deliver a functional demonstrator electronic system using these methods.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

This can be accomplished through frequency selective surfaces. This project proposes to design and develop a novel integrated structure using production-ready materials that: can withstand high temperatures, insulates antennas and associated electronics from the heat, is transparent to specific radio frequencies, and reflects RF energy outside the antenna band by combing multiple materials and technologies developed under previous SBIR programs. Our design leverages the dielectric properties of the low density thermal insulation to enhance RF transmission characteristics. The design also addresses the attachment of these integrated structures to the vehicle by leveraging the capability of our proposed ceramic material to include drilled holes for high temperature fasteners that achieve load transfer, minimize heat transfer, and accommodate differential coefficients of thermal expansion.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

During the Phase I base, NanoSonic will empirically optimize the RF, thermal \/ insulative, and mechanical properties of its CMC TPS radome materials. Upon advancement into the Phase I option, NanoSonic will produce component scale radome structures using its in-house filament winding assembly to demonstrate near-term manufacturing capability. NanoSonic has generated significant defense prime interest in the proposed radome technology and has an established pilot scale manufacturing infrastructure that may transition down-selected resins to 55-gallon batch production quantities.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

        "abstract": "MDA requires novel technological solutions to cost-efficiently keep pace with the breakneck speed of missile advances around the world. Missile system avionics miniaturization needs have never been more urgent to enable expanded payloads or reduced vehicle size for maneuverability. One such critical avionics system is the inertial measurement unit (IMU), where optical gyroscopes have shown highest performance. Passive optical gyroscopes (POG) offer the best combination of performance and robustness, but require breakthrough approaches to subsystem miniaturization to allow continued SWaP reduction. IFOS and the University of California at Santa Barbara propose the development of an integrated optical driver (IOD) based on innovative photonic integrated circuits (PIC) to enable ultra-low-loss POG inertial measurement unit (IMU) miniaturization. The IOD will comprise all gyro active components (optical source, phase modulators, photodiodes, and couplers) in an area of 4.5 mm2. In Phase I, IFOS will enhance IOD design and components to maximize performance and robustness. In Phase II, IFOS will integrate the IOD in its commercial ultra-low-loss, high-bandwidth POG for IMU implementation and sounding rocket flight testing. IFOS is collaborating with leading guidance, navigation, &amp; control (GN&amp;C) primes to accelerate Phase III commercialization and technology transition to DoD missions.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

During Phase I, the proposed team will evaluate artificial intelligence algorithms to model noisy MEMS sensor data. A deep learning methodology will be employed to effectively define complex, compositional nonlinear functions, to learn distributed and hierarchical feature representations, and to make effective inference of both labeled and unlabeled data. We plan on implementing machine learning algorithm on a FPGA platform after identifying the most promising software algorithms. The Phase I program is ambitious by design but we believe that research plans are realistic and achievable because of our expertise and resources accumulated from on-going research in the areas of inertial sensor design, machine learning, and microelectronics. The prototype hardware is useful for ground testing and to demonstrate that the proposed solution can meet flight environments. At the end of Phase II, a prototype will be ready to be flown on a sounding rocket flight test.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

WhizRT will be able to intelligently choose its actions through an attack behavior tree and execute attack steps across the hands-on playing field. It combines state-of-the-art machine learning with attack tree models and automated attack execution. The playing field is an actual networked IT environment hosted within a virtual machine environment. Using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (esp. artificial neural networks), the attacker can adapt its choices of attack steps over time by learning from the defenders behaviors, successes\/failures etc.The project revolves around two broad areas, the WhizRT intelligent red team system (based on AI, attack behavior trees, and attack step execution), and the training game concept and testbed (based on interconnected VMs with lifecycle management, scoring, education etc.). WhizRT will be developed to be flexible, and in particular to be deployable in other cybersecurity training game platforms.

        "abstract": "Corvid Technologies proposes to develop a real-time trajectory generation and optimization tool for integration into hypervelocity projectile (HVP) weapon systems. This technology will use the massively parallel computing power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to perform numerous simulations of HVP shots in short runtimes. The GPU based trajectory simulation tool will include a full six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) solver with high fidelity aerodynamic look up tables and guidance in the loop. A comprehensive Monte-Carlo analysis over all uncertainties (such as threat maneuvers, threat aerodynamics, and HVP launch conditions) will be performed to derive an average probability of kill for each candidate HVP trajectory. The performance of this hardware will enable the optimization of HVP trajectories based on threat information gathered in real time, such as threat type and tracking data. The trajectories of single and salvo HVP shots will be optimized using simulation-based optimization. In this Phase I effort Corvid will develop an initial 6-DOF GPU trajectory simulation capability. Corvid will demonstrate the runtime performance of the hardware and utilize it to investigate different approaches to optimizing HVP trajectories against a notional ballistic missile threat.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

The proposed method has its roots in the model-predictive closed-loop control technique. The threats, which may consist of multiple missiles, are being observed by ground-based radars or electro-optical\/infrared sensors. The hypervelocity projectiles attitude is then commanded using feedback from these sensors. The trajectory of the projectile is periodically updated to adjust to the maneuvers performed by the threat missile. The proposed solution will be scalable to control multiple hypervelocity projectiles simultaneously.During Phase I, feasibility of the proposed closed-loop algorithm for real-time trajectory adjustment of hypervelocity projectiles will be demonstrated. In Phase II, a prototype will be developed and will be demonstrated in hardware-in-the-loop simulations in collaboration with a major airframe integrator. Phase III part of the effort will be on transitioning this technology to MDA-identified hardware integrator for additional simulations, leading to flight tests.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

        "abstract": "Next generation hyper velocity projectiles (HVP) are needed to enhance lethality when deployed against ballistic missile re-entry vehicles (BMRVs). Opportunity exists for inventive payloads to increase lethality in non-Hit-to-Kill scenarios for gun launched projectiles. EMPIs concept for destroying BMRVs uses an enhanced HVP designed to project a fragment field that is forward focused, conical in shape and exhibits uniformly dense fragments. An innovative feature of the Forward Focused Fragment Hyper-Velocity projectile (F3HVP) is ability to launch a range of forward conical angles to enhance the probability of kill (Pk). EMPI is leveraging demonstrated technology to achieve this performance. Past work includes .50 BMG forward focused projectiles. Burster charges using both high explosive and smokeless propellant were demonstrated. Projectile lethality can be further enhanced via incorporation of structural reactive material (SRM) fragments. This SRM technology was matured by Lockheed Martin Missiles &amp; Fire Control for exoatmospheric interceptors is being advanced by EMPI to address ground targets. EMPIs extension includes increasing fragment density, compressive strength, and fuel content. Compressive strength is enhanced via optimization of binder alloy content. Selectable lethality options exist as the F3-HVP lends itself to real-time selection via multi-point initiation. LM Space Systems is our commercialization partner.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)+"

The reactive structural material proposed has a density of 8g\/cm3 and a compressive strength of 55,000psi previously used successfully in the defeat of 82mm mortar of foreign origin.This material can be used in a blast fragmentation, non-hit-to-kill or a hit-to-kill option. The proposed part insertion\/substitution concept will be subjected to several risk reduction ballistic experiments demonstrating projectile survival at 30,000 g, using targets ranging from carbon phenolic Re-Entry Vehicle (RV) heat shield to RV internal parts (electronics and munitions). L\/M will provide innovative payload designs including reactive part substitution, maximizing the HVP warhead lethality against ballistic, cruise and air defense missile threat using codes available from previous and current HVP contracts.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

        "abstract": "Future MDA interceptors require advanced propulsion capabilities, with higher performance in smaller, volume-constrained systems. Innovative propellant chemistry is needed to enable substantially greater performance in smaller packages. One factor limiting the maximum performance achievable in modern propellants is the slow ignition and combustion of the propellants metal fuel particles, typically aluminum. Problems due to the slow reaction of aluminum are exacerbated in small rocket motors. Incomplete aluminum combustion due to short residence time in small combustors causes significant performance loss. Therefore, the theoretical maximum performance of metal-loaded fuels is unattainable with existing technology. Helicon has developed a new class of polymer-bonded aluminum fuels to dramatically increase the specific impulse and burning rate capabilities of future propellants. Helicons technology fundamentally transforms the aluminum combustion mechanism. Using a novel, scalable in situ nanocomposite synthesis process, Helicon produces high-energy composites with near-molecular-level intermixing of the aluminum fuel and polymer binders, such as HTPB. For the Phase I project, Helicon will formulate propellants, measure burning rates, and perform rocket motor static fire tests to demonstrate improvements in specific impulse and burning rate compared to relevant baselines.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

Scalmalloy powder has been developed specifically for additive manufacturing (AM) by Airbus APWorks, and has properties that are comparable to 7075-T6 aluminum. Phase I efforts will include a trade study demonstrate that an AM Scalmalloy stage adapter can be processed at a lower cost and more quickly than a traditionally machined 7075-T6 geometry. A mass reduction task will also optimize the topology of the geometry, to allow for mass savings greater than 5%, while meeting shock, vibration, and acceleration load requirements. The proposed work also includes the build of multiple lightweighted stage adapter geometries, along with tensile, density, and surface finish samples, in order to determine the overall uncertainty of the SLM build process on the respective data samples, and to characterize dimensional consistency. The study concludes with an extensive DOE analysis to determine the sensitivity of strength, density, and surface finish to a wide range of build parameters. The study will serve as the first step in determining the optimum parameter operating space with the least variability. The heat treat process for Scalmalloy will also be optimized.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

        "abstract": "The Missile Defense Agency is searching for innovative technologies to implement in future interceptor missiles and kill vehicles that will produce weight savings within the systems. To answer this need, Touchstone Research Laboratory proposes to develop fiber reinforced aluminum (FRA) metal matrix composite components to replace those that were originally made from Ti-6-4. The FRA is able to retain its strength at high temperatures where the titanium alloy starts to see a drop in strength. Given the increase in elevated temperature strength, the components may be made with reduced material usage, leading to weight savings. Phase I work will consist of elevated temperature testing of the FRA material at temperatures like those seen during launch of the missile, evaluating potential component applications, and structural analysis of the selected components to determine how much weight can be reduced. A sub-scale demo article will be made to address possible concerns when fabricating prototypes that will be testing in Phase II, which will consist of building prototype structures and testing them to prove feasibility. Documentation will also be produced that address the manufacturing plan for the prototype articles and the risks of scale up. The proposed endeavor offers an elevated temperature titanium replacement.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

        "abstract": "NanoSonic will work with Virginia Tech nanomaterial physicists and Honeywell space system engineers to develop, demonstrate and transition to manufacturing rad hard resistive random access memories (RRAM) and related electronics based on resistive nanofilament bridges.Through prior basic research, NanoSonic has demonstrated early metal-insulator-metal (MIM) memory devices. Data is stored by creating a resistive bridge between the electrodes and erased by destroying the bridge.Data is not stored as electric charge so the device is radiation hard by design.We have also observed quantized and partial quantized conductance effects in the nanofilament bridges that connect the electrodes through the insulating layer. This means that data writing can potentially occur at low conductance, so RRAM can operate at low bias currents and thus low dissipated power.Important as well, we have observed this behavior at room temperature, suggesting that such quantum material effect-based mechanisms may be practical for next generation RRAM and other devices.During Phase I, NanoSonic would design, fabricate, demonstrate and deliver low power rad hard RRAM and related memory resistor (memristor) devices, and, with Honeywell, plan how technology may be transitioned to the manufacturing of rad hard memory for space systems and related electronic components for commercial use.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

        "abstract": "The MDA has needs for radiation-hardened electrical components and circuits. Thermionic-based vacuum devices have demonstrated their ruggedness and insensitivity to radiation, making them the top choice for space based operation.However, manual and cumbersome fabrication does not render it to circuit integration in an integrated circuit (IC) format to ensure best reliability and performance possible, until now. InnoSys has successfully demonstrated its Solid State Vacuum DeviceTM (SSVDTM) concept of employing advanced microfabrication and IC structure into VED design to dramatically improve performance, reliability and manufacturing. For this SBIR, InnoSys will focus on, as InnoSys calls them, microminiature- thermionic-vacuum (MTV) devices (e.g. vacuum diodes, triodes, and transistors) which has been developed as a part of our SSVDTMs.Originally developed for harsh environment particularly extreme temperatures, verification testing by third parties has verified their radiation insensitive operation.InnoSys has continued to improve SSVDTMs based on new techniques including additive manufacturing. The results of this effort within VEDs will led to the IC design\/manufacturing of MTV based radiation insensitive electronics. These will become the basic building blocks for radiation insensitive digital and analog ICs with inherent operate-through capability requiring minimal shielding and\/or C&amp;R under this SBIR specifically to meet the needs of MDA.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

Our prototype system will be based on a field-effect transistor and contain custom-engineered metal oxide channel materials. These materials are selected for their exceptional radiation hardness, high dielectric coefficients and the ease of which they could be integrated into current CMOS manufacturing processes. In this Phase I project, we will fabricate carefully-designed devices, and test their resistance to ionizing radiation, including neutron beam, X-rays and gamma-rays, using our in-house sources.

Triton Systems, in collaboration with our partner will develop and demonstrate a procedure to apply metallic coatings onto additively manufactured polymeric metal forming dies to increase their strength, hardness, heat resistance, and durability.To accelerate the development in the proposed effort, we will leverage success from our relevant work for the Air Force in which we improved the adhesion of metal foil to an additively manufactured polymer by almost an order of magnitude.This will allow for improved adhesion of the coatings to increase the hardness and wear performance of the die."

For this, the initial crack state of material burns will be characterized, the conditions that develop material burns will be characterized, the feasibility of applying DTA to selected areas of landing gear parts will be demonstrated, non-destructive inspection capabilities to quantify cracks in material burns will be surveyed, and a test plan that develops data to apply DTA methods using LEFM to predict critical crack sizes and crack growth rates for high strength steel with material burns will be developed."

        "abstract": "During the refurbishment of turbine engine parts, various coatings are applied to well-defined areas to meet specification. Uncoated surfaces are protected by a mask during the coating process. Masking materials typically include wax, tape, plastics, lacquers, or a variety of permanent masks. The time required to adequately mask a part using any of these methods is excessive, and creates a bottleneck in the turbine engine repair workflow. The 76th Propulsion Maintenance Group (PMXG) at Tinker Air Force Base is seeking to automate the application of UV-curable maskants for plating and other coating processes to further increase throughput across all coating processes (e.g. plating, plasma spray, HVOF, painting, etc.).To meet PMXGs needs, Systems &amp; Materials Research Corporation (SMRC) will develop an automated UV-curable mask application system to support the 76th PMXG plating line. In Phase I, feasibility of SMRCs system will be proven by demonstrating the application of a UV-curable maskant to representative turbine engine vanes with well-defined mask edges, creating a notional design of the automated UV-curable mask application system scalable to other parts and coating processes, and developing a cost benefit analysis model to compare the cost of automating mask application to traditional masking processes."

        "abstract": "Plating, plasma spraying, and other coating techniques require masking, covering the surfaces that are not to be treated. Masking is difficult for complex parts. It can take days and risk damage to the part, and human talent for masking is hard to find and keep. To address this difficulty, robotics offers a solution that is efficient, safe, and reliable. Energid will develop a hardware\/software robotic system for the Air Force that is optimized for masking. It will use a spray-type applicator and be extendable to other types. Sensors will be applied to analyze the shape of each part to be masked and use this information to create an intuitive user interface for configuring the masking process. For repeat and similar parts, the operator-configured masking process will be stored in a database and reused. This will enable the system to efficiently mask all types of parts even when drawings are not available. A cost-benefit analysis tool will be designed and integrated into the user interface. In Phase I, Energid will create a design, a prototype user interface, and demonstrate the system in software simulation. To do this quickly, Energid will apply its commercial Actin software toolkit for robot simulation and control."

KCFs innovative approach builds on extensive experience gained from applying similar technologies in industrial and military fields.The concept proposed lends itself to retrofit applications by allowing control and monitoring through existing electrical interfaces, and maintaining a small size to utilize available space.By logging detailed statistics of CSD use, the conditions that lead to failure can be quantified, and the accumulation of damage can be modeled.This will improve reliability and reduce maintenance cost by avoiding cascading failures without using conservative maintenance schedules."

The development of the system will be generated based of the proposed architecture, and a complete prototype will designed, fabricated, and tested during the Phase I effort to verify system performance prior to a Phase II.The Phase I program is significant because it enables demonstration of all critical components prior to a following effort, thereby reducing technical and schedule risk.

These classes of devices are not easily modeled in a simulation software environment such as Teradynes LASAR. Currently the hardware modeling system providers such as the Teradyne and Synopsys have discontinued production and support of their respective hardware modeling systems. These systems are critical to the successful development of test programs being developed at numerous Air Force and Navy locations. A method to utilize commercially available digital test hardware, currently employed in VDATS and LMSTAR ATE platforms, provides an ideal solution to the hardware modeling obsolesce issue. Using the Di-Series digital test subsystem as the hardware interface to LASARs digital simulator would eliminate the obsolescence of proprietary hardware while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing hardware models.The objective of this research is to investigate the use of the Teradynes Di-Series digital subsystem as a replacement of the D300 hardware. The investigation will address LASAR to MDLMAN communications,Di-Series compatibility with D300 and hardware interfacing in assessing the suitability and functionality of the proposed solution."

        "abstract": "The objective of this Research &amp; Development project is to investigate and develop the amplifier design concepts and technologies necessary to build a wideband (approximately six decades), high-power, modular, cascadable amplifier system which will meet the requirements for driving an unknown or dynamic load (varying from zero to infinite impedance), for the purposes of supporting Direct Drive testing for MIL-STD-3023. The intention for this new design is to allow the amplifier to operate at full power (as defined in the testing standards), over the full bandwidth of interest (i.e., 10 kHz-2 GHz), while experiencing non-optimum VSWR due to changing impedances from the Unit Under Test, and without sustaining damage or initiating amplifier shutdown. The results of this Phase I project will provide the technical approach for defining the circuit architectures, components, and internal control functions, which can then be used for a prototype system to be demonstrated in a later development Phase (II). In addition to producing an amplifier which will meet the requirements of the referenced MIL-STD, this amplifier design is anticipated to support new commercial, amplifier-based products and automated testing systems, and thus will be targeted to support Commercial testing standards where similar effects with impedance are present."

Use as an extension of the J-35 strike fighters capabilities and force projection in deep and first strike missions could be critical in achieving air dominance over adversaries. New LCC CERs that account for differing operational capabilities of drone craft such as rail-launching, parachute recovery, modular build-outs, and expendable pods along with general safety, logistics, maintenance, and related operational issues will be critical where first strike mission ratios maybe a large as 20:1 expendable drones to single J-35. Drones could be launched from several points and join together for strike missions and depart in separate directions providing defensive cover for main controlling aircraft. These new CERs will be developed using a proven system\/subsystem decomposition methodology combined with effective COTS\/GOTS maintenance and support practices and then compiled or recombined into a single platform representative of the envisioned strike mission drone aircraft. Novel aspects of this approach include segregation of recoverable\/unrecoverable systems versus highly integrated aircraft systems which allow for significantly more operational scenarios and decreased LCC requirements."

In order to design a successful mobile communication architecture based on the Air Force requirements for surveillance and reconnaissance in combat situations, we will address these key challenges: security encryption of voice and data; increase data speeds from the legacy VHF systems of less than 25 Kbps to higher data rates beyond 10 Mbps for the new Ka-band systems; resistance to jamming, spoofing and other purposeful interference; size reduction of avionics and terminals to reduce the mass and footprint of the electronics; and surveillance and navigation functions for triangulation of mobile vehicles."

To meet this need, Mimyr proposes a OSIRIS (Optimized Software Interpreter for Routing via Iridium Satellites) system. The goal of OSIRIS is to increase the functionality of existing communications infrastructures by supplementing them with an Iridium NEXT based backbone to allow for global communication of otherwise limited services. OSIRIS leverages the capabilities of commercial-off-the-shelf components, a software reconfigurable architecture, and a ruggedized design to provide systems with increased communications reach while reducing the need for multiple radio devices, which each require unique batteries, wiring, antennas, and integration demands. This allows for highly efficient, secure, and high bandwidth communication based on cutting edge future constellations. In Phase I, Mimyr will focus on proving feasibility of the OSIRIS architecture, which will be supported by a hardware prototype based on the current Iridium platform and associated requirements."

An AESA product would offer three distinct advantages over commonly used parabolic reflector antennas: 1. A low profile flat panel form factor, 2: Reduction (or possible elimination) of a mechanical positioning system typically used for steering of a parabolic reflector, and 3: very fast beam steering eliminating the need for dual antennas to achieve constant connectivity with MEO\/LEO constellations.. The recent commercial development of ICs intended as discrete radiating components with individually adjustable radiation patterns are the foundation for this work. The product applications of this technology can be used both commercially and for the warfighter, either as a vehicular accessory for SATCOM on the move, or as a deployable antenna supporting a ground based terminal for the warfighter. Though this IC technology is designated as a commercial available product for satellite infrastructure, it is borne out of terrestrial 5G technology. This effort is intended to leverage the new 5G technology for the purpose of replacement of what would currently require a system based on a mechanically-steered parabolic reflector."

        "abstract": "Proposed NGSO communications constellations will provide global coverage with significantly increased bandwidth with the commercial objective of providing world-wide internet access. These constellations are expected to exceed a megabit\/second and can be used to augment existing Air Force communication satellite assets. The hardware required to interface with these constellations will also have significantly lower SWAP requirements than what is needed to interface with the DoDs current satellites. These features will enable CONOPS for military missions that require high bandwidth data capabilities. Examples include control and communications with swarms, video based ISR, and streaming large quantities of sensor data for off-board processing. Utilities that communicate with these constellations must be secure and remain operational as the constellations and commercial landscape evolve. The challenge for DoD is how to take full advantage of these constellations and the capabilities they will enable. Emergent proposes the development of ICoNS (International Communication Network Software) a software application to provide secure communication through the internet connections provided by these NGSO networks. Additionally, Emergent proposes the extension of DISCo (Distributed In-flight Sensor Control), Emergents software framework for the control and management of sensors to utilize ICoNS to operate over these NGSO networks."

        "abstract": "In this proposal, to facilitate the use of emerging commercial non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite commucniation (SATCOM) systems, Intelligent Fusion Technology proposes to develop a software system that is able to address serveral key problems in the acquisition of commercial NGSO SATCOM resources and the effective use of NGSO SATCOM resources in Air Force missions. The proposed software system consists of multiple key function modules. First a Mission\/operation Communication Resource Assignment Tool (MCRAT) addresses the problem of optimal allocation of various types of communication resources including NGSO, GEO, terrestrial communication network resources to best satisfy Air Force missions communication requirements. The MCRAT is a online function module, which works with mission terminals to achieve automatic mission communication resource allocation and re-allocation during AF missions\/operations. Second, a NGSO Network Performance statistic gathering and behavior Learning Tool (NPLT) is proposed to collect end-to-end NGSO network performance statistics during use of NGSO network, which supports the learning and prediction of NGSO SATCOM performance in different service areas over different time periods. Third, a Mission Communication Requirement Evaluation Tool (MCRET) and a NGSO SATCOM Service Matching Tool (NGSOSMT) are proposed to assist the selection of short term commercial NGSO services."

        "abstract": "Military installations operating in forward locations face unique challenges when attempting to automate threat detection in security monitoring. Due to complex interactions with allied and adversarial groups and the temporary nature of many such bases, development of a general framework that can identify emerging security threats in these dynamically changing environments poses an array of difficult technical obstacles. DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC) proposes the development of the Discovery of Anomalous Activity in Real Time (DAART) system. The DAART system is unique in its approach to threat monitoring in that it requires no supervised data to be trained for use at a new facility. Interpretations of incoming sensor information and detection of anomalous activity will be learned through strictly unsupervised machine learning methods at each base where the system is deployed. This allows the system to be highly adaptable and easily customized to the individual environment of each base, and lowers the requirements to deploy the system in new locations. Classification of threats will be learned using a semi-supervised machine learning technique in collaboration with operators, which will allow an extremely high level of control over threat detection and classification, while also minimizing the false alarm rate of the system."

        "abstract": "Applying machine learning based multi-sensor analytics to detect, identify, and associate threats to forward deployed installations requires a multidisciplinary approach. In addition, uniquely combining machine learning with multi-INT sensing significantly increases the capability to detect and understand threats from physical intrusion. However, traditional security and surveillance solutions typically process and analyze sensor outputs independently without intelligently combining information between multiple sensor types - leaving the capabilities of these systems limited or predictable. Therefore, we propose an effort to research and develop improved multi-sensor analytics methods based on machine learning, specifically for forward operating bases in areas with adjacent or nearby urban environments. More specifically, we propose combining a DLRT for object (e.g., video, person, etc.) detection and tracking with the RNN-LSTM method described in the last section for combined video, signal and acoustic detection, tracking, and notification (i.e., automatic sentences or tag sequences) of threats (both objects and behavior). We will establish the relevance of the proposed machine learning approaches based on our previous experience and ongoing efforts with similar applications. In addition, we will identify relevant data sources, both new and from our existing catalog of projects, that support threat detection and prediction."

        "abstract": "Friendly forces at forward operating bases and expeditionary airfields require autonomous solutions to alerts of potential threats (dismounts, drones, etc.). For such a system to be useful, it needs to operate at high probability of detection and low probability of false alarm. Several technical challenges exist, including the variability of environments and threat types, the presence of background activity, and the need for an easy set-up process. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a Layered Omnidirectional Threat Tracking and Alert system (LOTTA). LOTTA uses a scalable, heterogeneous suite of complimentary sensors (EO\/IR, GMTI and UGS) to detect threats of varying type (humans, vehicles, quad-copters, etc.) and behaviors (moving and stationary). Next, LOTTA uses STRs Multi-Stage Multiple-Hypothesis Tracker (MS-MHT) to fuse detections from complementary sensors and track these potential threats. LOTTA uses state-of-the art machine learning techniques to classify target types, and detect attributes and behaviors that could indicate a threat (e.g., a human carrying a weapon, or a vehicle driving a certain way toward the asset). Finally, LOTTA provides a user interface for easy sensor configuration, threat definition (e.g., drawing of a tripwire) and threat alert."

(IAI), along with Dr. Tianfu Wu of North Carolina State University, proposes to develop threat detection system called: Multi-sensor Automatic Threat Identification and Localization Deep-learning Architecture or MATILDA. Our solution consists of a hierarchical deep temporal model that will reason over individual people as well as groups of detected people. It uses a context aware fully convolutional networks to detect, localize, and identify multiple objects of interest in the scene. These will allow LSTMs to process features from multiple objects and allow the deep model to learn the relations between the people and their appearances that contribute to recognizing different types of threat activities."

Because impact ionization coefficient for electrons, gamma is larger than that for holes, which enables low noise multiplication in APDs. However, significant drawbacks to HgCdTe materials such as fragility, difficulty in single-crystal growth have triggered the search for III-V\/IV hybrid alternatives, employing either device structure or materials innovations.InAs, has many desirable attributes for APDs: low electron effective mass of ~0.023m0, high saturation velocity, large gamma-L and gamma-X separations that are larger than bandgap, resulting in useful gain at modest electric fields; 50% larger electric fields are required for HgCdTe.So far AlxIn1-xAsySb1-y lattice-matched to GaSb as material system due to many possible applications for AlxIn1-xAsySb1-y alloys lattice-matched to GaSb in mid-infrared (IR) and near-IR optoelectronic devices. But, still growth of this alloy have remained largely unexplored, which is due to the presence of a wide miscibility gap. However, it has recently been shown that stable AlInAsSb can be grown within the miscibility gap by molecular-beam-epitaxy as a digital alloy of component binaries, AlAs, AlSb, InAs, and InSb. We have extended this method which covers the entire direct bandgap compositional range of AlInAsSb lattice-matched to GaSb."

The APD structure will be based on a staircase APD architecture, where composition and field are varied sequentially such that electron ionization is promoted and hole ionization is supressed. Using band-edge modeling tools and custom numeric simulation tools, in Phase I, the staircase APD designs will be optimized. Epitaxial wafers will then be grown that incorporate the design(s). Various area\/perimeter ratio elements will be used to identify sources of dark current, and data from dark-current distributions of the various multi-staged APDs over a range of temperatures will be used to determine the locations and the dominant sources of dark-current contributors in the device. The gain, gain-bandwidth, linearity, and excess-noise performance of the APDs will be characterized as functions of the design of the gain stage and the number of gain stages used.Arrays will also be fabricated for integration into focal-plane arrays in Phase II."

        "abstract": "ASI proposes to develop ceramic matrix systems to replace the legacy fully micro-cracked morphology with a high strain, ligamentary, engineered foam structure producing a tough, high translation composite with available free volume for additives to further enhance performance. Historical toughening via uncontrolled shrinkage in thermal processing reduces interlaminar and in-plane properties without sealing out detrimental atmospheres. Disassembling Pyrograf III stacked cup carbon nano-fibers (CNFs) yields high strain, short Length\/Diameter (L\/D) 100 nm tubes with huge strain capabilities (&gt;1000% transverse) which are small enough to infiltrate lamina filaments and, when subsequently fillet bonded, produce a 0.15 to 0.3 volume fraction foam with properties typical of a tough organic matrix system. Manipulating this porous skeletal framework, mechanical properties can be tailored for optimum composite performance and the free volume can be filled with protective and self-repairing agents to protect against environmental and physical damage via multi-temperature glass forming refractory chemistries. The proposed effort will feature modification of carbon nanofibers, dispersion into pre-ceramic polymers and conversion into ceramic matrix composites using conventional polymer processing techniques.The resulting composites will characterized for physical and mechanical properties and will be benchmarked against conventional ceramic matrix composites for both cost and performance."

        "abstract": "To address the Air Force need to improve the acquisition lifecycle cost estimation process, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new software tool: Enterprise Cost Estimation through Lifecycle Simulations (ELIS). ELIS uses lifecycle simulations to compute financial implications on cost centers ranging from higher echelons of the DoD to system program offices. The cost trade-offs and detailed cost breakdowns computed by ELIS are based on aggregated components cost obtained by considering various architectural\/engineering issues, testing scenarios, operational CONOPS, and mission configurations. The innovative ELIS design captures intricate mutually recursive dependency relationships among various stakeholders, cost centers, and cost elements, yielding accurate cost estimates for various what-if scenarios. ELIS design can use data, models, or a combination thereof to adapt to various stages of the acquisition lifecycle, data availability\/granularity\/modalities. ELIS offers dramatic advances in the current cost estimation methodology by improving acquisition cost estimations and predictions, directly addressing the requirements. In Phase I, ELIS feasibility will be demonstrated by integrating diverse digital engineering ecosystem elements (such as workforce, facilities, data storage cost, licensing cost, and inventory) into a tailored cost model reaching TRL-3. In Phase II, POC plans to improve ELIS and reach TRL-5 by implementing a full-scale prototype."

        "abstract": "Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) is a critical capability that has become indispensable to the United States military, government services, and the commercial sector.As GPS-jamming technology becomes both more widely available and less costly, it becomes increasingly more critical to provide resilient navigation and timing independent of GPS. Under this effort, Numerica Corporation proposes to develop a fully distributed and scalable algorithm to mitigate localization drift within a network of agents when GPS has been jammed.The cooperative navigation algorithm uses range measurements between pairs of agents to synergistically improve navigation accuracy at each agent. Numerica&apos;s proposed algorithm is highly flexible, capable of considering heterogeneous sensors and platforms. Further, while the proposed algorithm only assumes the existence of relative ranging between some agents, it is able to optimally integrate any additional sensing information available to any agent within the network, and efficiently propagate that information through the network to all other agents. Finally, the proposed algorithm has been designed with scalability in mind, and efficiently runs on very large networks, with total processing and communication remaining constant at each agent (independent of the size of the network)."

        "abstract": "Future weapons must generate greater lethality from volume-limited platforms while providing increased mission flexibility. These challenges will be met by non-traditional missile systems requiring development of new materials and designs including energetic materials adaptable for use in both propulsion and lethality roles. Such dual-mode energetic materials would achieve volume efficiency while also providing kinematic adaptability and contributions to lethality. To accomplish this goal, control of combustion behavior, and the balancing of reactivity versus sensitivity will be essential. Helicon proposes a unique in situ nanocomposite processing technology to produce a family of propellants with the functional characteristics required for dual-mode performance, thus providing a toolbox of approaches adaptable to varying system requirements. Functionalities achievable include high burning rates to enable highly loaded grain designs; high pressure extinguishment capability for throttling concepts; and nanoscale reactive materials to facilitate initiation and reactivity. Helicons in situ nano-aluminum synthesis technology is the key innovation, representing a fundamentally different approach to producing nanoparticle-containing materials from conventional physical mixing. Helicon grows nanoparticles in a bottom-up fashion within host materials including liquid fuels, polymer binders, and plasticizers. This process creates homogeneous nanoparticle dispersions within host materials, with nanoparticles fully encapsulated by the surrounding polymer, inhibiting oxide growth."

There currently exists an Air Force need for optical source exclusion to allow next-generation infrared camera technology to observe a large field of view (+\/- 45 degrees, ~ 15% of the sky). While such systems will enable new tracking capabilities, the sun will often be within the field of view, leading to blooming on the focal plane array. PSIs filter will be placed at an intermediate focal plane and will be able to operate in two paradigms. The first will use the full spectrum of the suns energy to attenuate the IR transmission only where the image of the sun is formed, allowing the bright source to be dimmed without distorting or blocking the rest of the image field, and will not require an external power source The second will be sensitive to less bright objects, such as the moon, where feedback from the filter can determine which areas of the filter are turned on and off."

        "abstract": "Devices that produce high-power radio frequency and optical radiation can be hazardous to operate and can lead to overexposures in humans. Because human experiments are undesirable, analysts use software chains to predict exposures: these range from simulations of the devices to propagation of the electromagnetic waves through the environment and finally to simulations of effects in human tissue. Galaxy, a government-owned workflow management and remote computing tool suite was designed to automate simulation tool chains and has been previously applied to chains that include the same wave propagation tools that are used for hazard modeling. However, expanding the Galaxy tool suite into novel regimes and creating the required software modules demands deep expertise in the tool itself. To ease this process, we will develop new usability features for Galaxy, including user-defined software modules that can be shared and improved by groups of analysts who have no programming experience. We will demonstrate these features on prototypical workflows for hazard assessments. Since this process inevitably will include the parameterization of posing of human models, we will furthermore integrate our existing posing technologies into the state-of-the-art tools that are used for optical exposure modeling in the field."

        "abstract": "The need to understand and characterize the risks posed to humans due to electromagnetic emitters has motivated the development of several high-fidelity simulation packages able to model the physical effects of electromagnetic radiation impinging on biological tissues. These simulation packages support large numbers of input parameters, make use of custom input and output file formats, and often require the use of high-performance computing resources. Consequently, the functionality of these tools is often inaccessible to analysts that lack extensive programming and physical modeling experience. Galaxy is a scientific workflow system that provides access to multiple pre-configured tools that can be linked together through an easy-to-use interface. Several electromagnetic propagation software packages are already part of Galaxy instances hosted by Air Force Research Laboratory. Yet, analysts are currently unable to accelerate analyses on the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation using Galaxy because existing bioeffects codes lack Galaxy support. Nanohmics, Inc. proposes to extend the capabilities of current Galaxy instances to include end-to-end analysis of the biological effects of electromagnetic emitters at optical and radio frequencies by developing the Galaxy EM Bioeffects Application Integration Suite, a suite of Galaxy integration tools for government-owned bioeffects codes and existing 3D posable human models."

        "abstract": "To address the Air Force need for an innovative, portable, tunable, high-voltage, nanosecond electrical pulse generator that can deliver 100 kV300 kV to a 200-ohm load, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISS) proposes to develop a Portable Nanosecond Electrical Pulser (PONSEP) device based on a new toroid high-voltage energy transfer design. Specifically, the innovation in high-voltage deliver and fast rise-time repetitive electrical pulse components will enable the PONSEP to generate nanosecond electrical pulses at desired repetition and energy. As a result, this device offers adjustable high-voltage electrical pulse capability in the 100 kV300 kV range in 10 kV increments, adjustable pulse width with 1000 ns steps and pulse repetition frequency with 0.1 Hz to 0.003 Hz adjustability. In Phase I, ISS will demonstrate the feasibility of the portable nanosecond pulser by developing a breadboard for use in a laboratory setting, meeting basic requirements for repeated nanosecond electrical pulse generation. In Phase II, ISS plans to construct and demonstrate a functional prototype of the device. A biologically relevant load for high-voltage delivery will be used. The prototype will address the general requirements listed above, as well as the method for electrical delivery control when transferring energy to the target."

        "abstract": "Modern military success is as much about diplomacy, and gaining the support of local citizens as it is combat, further non-combatant casualties and collateral damage can result in significant complications in winning the battle of public perception. This type of warfare has led to an increased focus on the use of less-lethal weapons, to reduce collateral damage in urban battlespaces .These changes in warfare require significant advancements in available weaponry and resources. The Joint Non-Legal Weapons Program (JNLWP) was founded on the premise of minimizing civilian casualties and collateral damage. Within the modern urban battlefield, the need often arises for weapons capable of incapacitating targeted personnel quickly, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury, and damage to non-combatant assets within the battlespace. To address the needs laid out in the Air Force solicitation AF181-002, Hyperion proposes the investigation of a promising technology originally developed for the Armys Intense Electromagnetic Pulse (IMP) Grenade program to produce a requisite NSEP source that could meet both the pulse parameters of a medical research device while providing a path of scalability to match the volume constraints of a future 40mm munition delivered non-lethal device"

        "abstract": "Despite advances in ejection seat design and injury mitigation, crew protection can likely be improved with better characterization of this hazardous environment during actual ejection events.Measurement of head\/neck 6DOF motion in this environment has unique challenges.An ultra-low power system requires sensing deep sleep and idle states until a threshold is reached indicating an actual ejection event.Since ejection accelerations can have similar magnitude and duration as normal ACM, discrimination between these two event types can be difficult.For DTS SBIR work on a system to automatically jettison a HMDS during ejection events there was zero tolerance for false positives.In this application where ejection event data is the primary goal, the system may trigger and record previous ACM events, looping in memory to save the last, most recent events, including pre-trigger data and timestamps for the final ejection event(s) of interest.Unique to this proposal is a technical breakthrough in angular sensing technology.DTS proposes to deliver a revolutionary prototype 6DOF Dynamic Impact Recorder (DIR) that will have greater than 10-fold reduction in size and mass compared to existing systems.This autonomous system would be small, ultra-low power and weigh less than 20 grams."

        "abstract": "There exists an under-utilized portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, located between the microwave and infrared wavelengths, in the sub-millimeter band.This region, known as terahertz radiation, has historically been problematic to access.There have been numerous demonstrations of THz electronics using LTS Josephson junctions that provide precise frequency control and on-chip detection via the AC Josephson effect.Unfortunately, the mature technology of niobium Josephson junction fabrication imposes an upper frequency cutoff of about 0.75 THz, a fundamental limit defined by the superconducting energy gap in niobium.HTS materials can have energy gaps greater than 40 mV which may allow for frequencies above 10 THz and provide a solution that can cover the entire 1.010 THz band.More reliable fabrication methods of HTS Josephson junctions have metallic diffusive Josephson barriers that preclude use at THz frequencies.Recently, one of us has demonstrated a new, scalable, nanomanufacturing method of HTS devices utilizing a focused helium ion beam to directly write junctions into a commercially grown HTS thin film. Here, we propose to research and develop HTS emitters and receivers of THz radiation using this low-cost manufacturing technique."

To address the aforementioned technical gap, the proposed effort seeks to design well-defined test protocols suitable for assessing the thermomechanical response and potential degradation of polymer-bonded composite materials under sustained mechanical vibration in a wide range of operational environments, as specified by ambient temperature and, where relevant, humidity.The effort will specifically encompass: (1) the design and optimization of a test procedure that enables rapid material characterization under specified levels of vibration loading and operationally-relevant environmental conditions; (2) the design of a small, complementary suite of test hardware that is amenable for use with existing general use test equipment; and (3) the documentation of a standardized test protocol (inclusive of both hardware and associated procedures), which is suitable for experimental validation and ultimately transition to, and implementation by, the United States Air Force and select partners."

In Phase I, RISL will develop the ICE design and a proof-of-concept prototype for feasibility demonstration. We will also conduct preliminary business case analysis (BCA) to determine implementation costs, including a return-on-investment (ROI) calculation that compares anticipated savings to expected costs and increased safety. In Phase II, RISL will develop an installation-ready ICE prototype after multiple design iterations. The prototype will be tested to meet the AF requirements.

Adding to this inherent danger, the activity of dissection for the purpose of evaluation poses significant challenges in terms of safety and handling of both the dissected rocket motor before, during and after dissection and the handling of the particulate created in the dissection process.This proposal intends to address these challenges to the safety and the effectiveness of the dissection process by minimizing the amount of particulate produced, eliminating the potentialfor heat or ignition sources from being produced and automating the process to such a degree as to minimize the interaction of personnel to only that which is absolutely necessary. All dissection activities will be carried out by automated systems. All monitoring will be recorded by automated subsystems capable of shutting down the system and engaging fire suppression hardware at the moment the dissection process exceeds safety tolerances. Monitoring by personnel will available at a safe distance from the dissection activities. All particulate handling and collection will be automated to the utmost extent possible leaving personnel interaction only in the removal of the particulate collection vehicle to an appropriate burn site."

DHPC will construct and test prototypes of key technologies and subsystems to optimize the prototype design.An end-user BCA and ROI analysis will highlight the cost benefits resulting from the improved steam metering capability using this innovative laser-based metering technology."

        "abstract": "Increasing energy costs have placed budget constraints on many branches of the military and has brought to the forefront the problem of reducing costs by maximizing energy efficiency. The Air Force currently heats many of its facilities with the use of steam-based HVAC systems and the overproduction of steam can exacerbate these internal costs. To optimize this steam production, the Air Force is seeking new steam metering technology that can attach externally to the flow path and maximize turndown rates. Nokomis proposes the development of a laser-based steam mass flow sensor that will produce no internal obstructions and that will be able to track the flow rate and concentration of saturated steam. The laser technology will integrate the precision aspects of laser imaging with the noninvasive and low-cost aspects of visible light spectroscopy."

Guidedwave) has developed a revolutionary guided wave phased array (GWPA) ultrasound technology for the efficient inspection of large-area structures for plate and weld defects. The patented GWPA technology performs rapid 360-degree volumetric guided wave scans of plates over an area up to 10 from the probe. Guidedwave proposes utilizing a remotely-deployed crawler robot equipped with the GWPA technology as the most efficient way to scan the ICBM silo walls. The crawler would automatically collect GWPA scans on a sparse grid, and at each data collection point, the probe would be deployed to the surface to collect a rapid (30-60 second) scan of the area around the probe. After completing the scans, the software would automatically compile them into a composite image of the entire structure, which would provide a quick, easy-to-understand representation of any indications of flaws across the structure. High-resolution UT point thickness measurements or scans would then be performed only in the corrosion areas indicated by the GWPA scan, rather than wasting time and money performing precise wall thickness measurements across the entire structure."

By leveraging and integrating industry-proven Phased Array Ultrasonic NDT and new, customized robotic crawler approach ideal for silos, we will develop, integrate, test advanced, fully automated corrosion mapping NDT solution using best-of-class hardware\/software.The user friendly system will be portable while being responsive to their silo or other large scale surface scanning needs to detect defect types, sizes, and spatially correlate to locations across these large inspection zones. This effort provides a high return on investment with new automated capabilities over existing inefficient methods used, delivers elegant scan path planning, and supports 3D scan modeling\/simulations to enhance tools and inspection execution. The first silo scan setup\/implementation will significantly accelerate the setup for all remaining silos.Custom, preinstalled inspection applications reduce training times and guide users through inspection procedures to improve productivity and minimize training costs."

Consequently, A 23 hour minimum HE relief bake at 375 F+\/-25 F is mandatory after application of the plating. In order to certify that the plating process is compliant with technical requirements of ASTM F519, HE test coupons are plated and HE relief baked, just like the HSS aircraft components, and tested periodically for HE in a sustained load test frame for 200 hours. Results from this testing provides an assurance that there was no HE damage in the plated parts 8.5 days earlier in the process. If there is a failure in the HE test, all parts processed over the past week and a half are under suspicion for HE and must be quarantined and held until additional testing is accomplished.

Both fluids allow for the development of non-ambient conditions like those experienced in the aerospace environment to evaluate the performance of test articles. However, introduction of Dynalene as a contaminant in the glycol raises concerns about equipment corrosion and is known to lower heat transfer coefficients in exchange equipment, including the glycol concentrator. The objective of the program is to remove the Dynalene at a sufficiently high rate while preserving the glycol inhibitor package. Additionally, the proposed system should be transportable, have non-permanent connections with the existing Arnold AFB glycol storage tank, have the smallest practical footprint, will be easy to operate, be as simple as possible, require the lowest amount of power and other utilities, and have little to no need for operator interaction. Process design and evaluation will proceed in a methodical way starting with laboratory demonstration of concept.

A test article is accelerated to velocity up to 18,000 ft\/s in a relevant atmosphere and travels up to 10,000 ft. It is important to measure the coating erosion at multiple discrete points along the trajectory to characterize non-linear ablation response.Existing measurement techniques employ ordinary high speed photography.Evaluation of the resulting 2-D images to infer 3-D ablation is challenging and imprecise, particularly considering the refractive errors introduced by the bow shock.We will develop a novel imaging system that will freeze motion even at peak velocities, directly measure the 3-D geometry of the test article front surface, and correct for refractive errors induced by shock waves in the flow field.The result of the measurement will be a 3-D point cloud with .001 resolution that can be directly compared to a nominal model and\/or to successive measurements to compute ablation rates."

        "abstract": "Verification of the proper separation of stores held on aircraft is critical to the mission and safety of the aircraft. Verification comes in the form of comparing the data from simulations, ground testing, and flight testing to determine the direction the device leaves the aircraft and the forces on the device, ensuring it will not break apart. The small size of the various stores being tested presents challenges for obtaining accurate force measurements on the scaled models used during wind tunnel testing. Conventional force balance technologies are not sensitive enough to capture the low aerodynamic forces exerted on the models. Luna is proposing to team with Calspan Force Measurement Systems to develop a miniature force balance that incorporates fiber optic sensing technology. During Phase I the team will leverage their previous successes in incorporating fiber into balance systems to design a novel, miniature, 6-component balance for store separation testing. During Phase II a prototype will be developed and delivered to the USAF for evaluation. It is anticipated that the balance developed during this effort will be transitioned to USAF and commercial wind tunnel facilities through a Phase III effort working with commercial partners within the aerospace industry."

        "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of the aerodynamic loading associated with stores leaving cargo\/weapons bays on military aircraft is critical in ensuring reliable safe-separation. Wind tunnel testing is a valuable design tool that allows for the prediction of the trajectory of small stores during separation. However, due to the small size of the wind tunnel models, extremely small balance systems are needed to resolve the forces and moments acting on the stores. Unfortunately, current balance systems are not available at the scale required to fit inside such a small test article. Ahmic Aerospace and our assembled team propose an innovative new approach to small balance technology. Semiconductor gages will be used for their favorable robustness, large signal output, and extremely small size compared to traditional transducer methods. In Phase I, a small-scale four-component balance system will be designed, manufactured, and instrumented as a test platform for the semiconductor measurement technology. Acceptance testing, NIST calibrations, laboratory demonstrations, and supersonic wind tunnel tests will be conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the semiconductor gages, establish measurement accuracy, and guide future program efforts. Lastly, a small-scale six-component balance system capable of meeting all SBIR requirements will be designed and simulated in preparation for Phase II."

The Air Force RAMGUN facility simulates this impulsive hydrodynamic loading for experimental testing of candidate structural joints. A projectile fired by a gas gun impacts one end of a water-filled chamber, launching a pressure wave that impinges on a test article at the opposite end.Unfortunately, the pressure pulse in the liquid excites a structural wave in the steel chamber that moves faster, arriving at the test section well in advance and perturbing both the test article and the diagnostics.We will design a test chamber that delays the structural wave relative to the pressure pulse, effectively isolating the test article from perturbation and improving experimental results. In addition, our design will improve energy transfer from the projectile to the water, extending the test range of the facility, and will facilitate scaling of the test section to larger diameter for testing full-scale joints."

Phase I will focus on the development of a geometry kernel for improving the original linear surface mesh using three modern technologies: 1) high-order analytical NURBS fitting; 2) Bzier surface fitting, and 3)modern subdivision surfaces, which has been widely used in computer animation and video games. The Phase I effort also includes curved surface element generation using the high-order NURBS analytical surface; coupling to the volumetric mesh deformation to improve the quality of curved meshes; and demonstrations for the problems of a) moving body, b) aeroelasticity and c) high-order element generation. Phase II will establish a versatile set of APIs comprising a well-developed geometry kernel to efficiently perform commonly required tasks related to geometry and associated computational meshes, and the source code will be provided for incorporation into larger DoD developed tools and frameworks."

Non-uniform rational basis splines (NURBS) are the shapes used to construct modern CAD and the math with efficient routines to compute them has been known for many years. If the physics solvers were able to couple to the NURBS geomety, it would allow for the exact, continuous geometry definition to be included in any simulations. Coupling the geometry with the solvers in this way would have far-reaching effects on simulations involving shape change such as ablation or aeroelasticsimulations, moving control surfaces such as fins and flaps, and high resolution automatic mesh refinement (AMR) to name just a few.An application programming interface (API) will allow solvers in any language to access the geometry kernel, whether its written in Fortran, C, or being run with a python script."

Accurate performance evaluation requires the capability to run controlled, accurate, consistent, and repeatable acceptance tests that rely heavily on monitoring of the cell conditions. Current monitoring systems have very limited capabilities and there is need to develop virtual reality (VR) systems supported by simultaneous visualization of the physical quantities measured by test cell sensors. Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes to develop VTCPresence, a virtual reality system capable of virtually placing a user into an active test cell. The proposed VTCPresence combines live data from many ruggedized 3D cameras into a single textured point cloud and uses it with available telemetry data to provide maintenance and analysis engineers (users) with a virtual copy of the test cell. VTCPresence will adapt IAIs novel 3D processing technologies with 3D depth cameras to construct a virtual reality environment. The user of VTCPresence will see a 3D view of the inside of the test cell, reconstructed from 3D camera data, plus overlays displaying relevant instrument readings and telemetry from the test cell."

        "abstract": "To address the Air Force need for a sensor capable of remote measurements of optical turbulence in surrounding air at a range of up to 10 km, Intellisense Systems Inc. (ISS) proposes to develop a new Dual-Receiver Turbulence LIDAR (DReTL) based on the use of backscattering amplification effect in the turbulent atmosphere that is directly related to the magnitude of the refractive index structure parameter. The compact eye-safe DReTL will be capable of operating automatically 24\/7 and providing the distribution of the refractive index structure parameter along its line of sight at a range of up to 10 km. A simple scanning mechanism will allow for the DReTL to be pointed in any direction in the hemisphere and collect volumetric data about the distribution of optical turbulence. The secured data transmission channels will connect the DReTL with the Air Force Weather Enterprise. In Phase I, ISS will optimize the design of the LIDAR prototype and will demonstrate feasibility by simulating its operation in a computer model. This demonstration will establish technology readiness level (TRL)-3 for the DReTL technology. In Phase II, ISS plans to develop and test the DReTL prototype in real operational conditions, thus reaching TRL-6."

        "abstract": "To support development of Directed Energy (DE) decision aids and to characterize optical turbulence along arbitrary slant paths, Trex in collaboration with GTRI proposes to develop the Turbulence Surveillance LIDAR (TSL), which is based on a synergistic coupling of Differential Image Motion (DIM) LIDAR with a passive DIM Monitor (DIMM). The DIM LIDAR determines vertical profiles of the refractive index structure parameter Cn2 by measuring both differential tilt and scintillation of a laser beacon created by a pulsed laser at different ranges. The use of scintillation measurements increases the convergence and improves spatial resolution of the inversion algorithm. The DIMM measures a path-integrated value of Cn2 over the entire atmosphere by imaging stars, thereby increasing the range of turbulence measurements up to the top of the atmosphere.Under the Phase I effort, several tasks will be performed: an analysis of existing and near-term optical turbulence collection sensors will be performed; system requirements will be defined; LIDAR performance will be evaluated; initial design of the DIMM will be developed; an advanced inversion algorithm will be developed; and a conceptual design of the Phase-II prototype will be developed. Under the Phase II effort, a TSL prototype will be built and tested."

The proposed turbulence collection system will be specified in Phase-1. A prototype system will be built and demonstrated in phase-2, including real-time links to a USAF-supplied data cube.In phase-3 the system will be modularized to provide a portable, remotely operated system with data link.The system will be designed for efficient duplication so multiple units can be provided for assisting self-defense of critical USAF bases."

        "abstract": "Thermal batteries are single discharge reserve batteries that provide very long shelf life, minimal self-discharge, wide storage temperature range, fast activation under sudden power demand, and also wide range of temperature operating conditions. Such unique properties among electrochemical power systems are provided with application of molten salt electrolyte, which is in solid form under normal storage conditions. Upon activation, thermal batteries are heated with an internal pyrotechnic heat charge above melting temperature of the molten salt electrolyte. This allows for fast ion mobility and facilitates charge transfer reaction. Due to the unique properties, thermal batteries are primarily used in DoD applications, specifically in munitions and weapon systems. Modern applications and their latest development call for rechargeable high performance, cost efficient, and reliable thermal batteries. We are proposing development and characterization of rechargeable thermal battery, which addresses the described needs and properties. The proposed solution addresses growing market segment, and it is required for the latest military applications and newly developed systems. Along with our development in Phase I and Phase II, we will aim for fully functional prototypes and field tries, and market of our technology to DoD agencies."

(PSI) will design a rechargeable thermal battery (RTB) capable of being activated, used, recharged and then stored in an inert state for extended periods of time (months to years). This battery will be designed to meet the power demands of airborne directed energy weapons (10-100 kW for 45 seconds). PSI will provide the desired energy and power density by augmenting state-of-the-art chemistries with high active (HA) cathode electrodes, lower melting point electrolytes, and novel lithium metal cell construction. During Phase I, PSI will conduct laboratory validation of thermal battery components for their ability to support rechargeability and the targeted power profile. The tests will be guided by a trade-space analysis of the current state of the art in thermal battery design. The cell designs, chemistries, and techniques demonstrated in Phase I will be used to design a prototype battery that will be constructed during Phase II. Successful completion of these efforts will demonstrate the readiness of the technology for further scale-up and demonstrations."

        "abstract": "The application of HPEM weapons to disable enemies electronic capabilities is hampered by the lack of practical tools for electronic BDA. To provide real-time, high-resolution BDA in complex, noisy environments requires the use of multiple sensing modalities interpreting diverse signals related to different types of target electronic components. To aggregate and interpret the data from these varied sensors, we propose the development of novel statistical tools for modeling the interactions among and between target system components and BDA sensors.The proposed framework is built on a Bayesian network that encodes the statistical dependencies between the states of target components and the results produced by the various sensing modules. Bayesian inference methods allow us to infer a probability distribution over the state of each target component and capability post-HPEM. This approach can incorporate all available intelligence on the target system composition, environmental factors, and the BDA sensors themselves, optimally incorporating this information and propagating the associated uncertainty forward to provide robust and actionable BDA. This basic model will be augmented by leveraging queuing theory to infer probabilistic recovery times for each target component and capability, and by inverting the inference problem to infer the expected utility of any specified sensing module."

The analysis uses expert and intelligence-derived target models to provide quantitative insights such as: (a) likely HPEM attack outcomes, (b) sensor allocation to verify attack effects, and (c) target reconstitution time estimates. The SRF uses machine learning to estimate engagement outcomes similar to traditional system reliability analysis. A novel modeling approach describes target and sensor operation in terms of input and output, (e.g. system resource flows), that capture analysis uncertainties.Synthetic data will be used for feasibility assessment since actual HPEM attack outcome data is limited.This Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) approach supports both planning and attack execution by leveraging the ability of the machine learning techniques to propagate probabilities in both forward and backward directions. The system will incorporate simulated faults (forward propagation) and sensor-observed evidence (back propagation) to estimate BDA in both planning and post attack phases. Emerging HPEM weapons such as the joint Air Force\/Navy HIJENKS system will require these planning and assessment capabilities to integrate into the US weapons inventory."

It provides tools for modeling the target system, HPEM weapon, and sensors used in an engagement. It integrates with various sensors and uses statistical analysis techniques and machine learning analytics to assess the state of the target system during and after an HPEM attack. EMBDAT integrates with our Toolkit for Assessing Electromagnetic Disruption Recovery (TAEMDR), which performs EM attack simulations that are used to train the EMBDAT classifiers. EMBDAT then utilizes classifier transformations to allow the trained classifiers to generalize to operate on different system and sensor configurations. During an HPEM attack and subsequent recovery, EMBDAT analytics run in real-time to provide the user continuous updates on the status of the target and the estimated time until it returns to normal operation. To support the EMBDAT development, we are investigating sensing techniques including active and passive cyber sensors as well as sensors based on side channel attacks."

In Phase I, we will use industry-standard M&amp;S tools to show that our solution could reliably connect Air Force sites across the Great Plains. We will also show how a network comprising fixed stations and shipboard and\/or airborne relays could offer a high-throughput alternative to the current HF Global Communication System. We will implement the HFGMN networking protocols and algorithms on top of a hardware or software defined radio (SDR) modem in Phase II and perform limited field testing to validate the Phase I M&amp;S results."

Specifically, the Phase I effort is aimed at designing and demonstrating innovative cognitive digital radio algorithms and networking protocols that will achieve data rates of over 300 Kbits\/second across distances of over 500 miles, and significantly improved link predictability, stability, and survivability. The frequency range of operation for the proposed radio design is the HF band (3 - 30 MHz). The survivability will be achieved through our fully distributed, rapidly converging channel rendezvous algorithms without external, designated relays or controllers. The Phase II effort will center on adding novel features such as jamming resistance and data security, conducting a comprehensive simulation study, and implementing and demonstrating a multi-node prototype system with the SWaP-friendly antenna and a complete suite of multi-hop ad hoc networking protocol suite."

Collection of communication-link quality data from amateur radio networks, in order to complement the ionospheric-sounder data that is commonly used to inform ionosphere models.2.Estimation of an ionospheric model that assimilates the reports communication-link quality, in addition to ionospheric sounder data.3.Use of the updated ionospheric model to generate metrics affecting link quality, wherein, the resultant metrics are designed to inform operators and to advance modern HF communication protocols.4. Visualization of link-quality metrics derived from the observation-informedionospheric model, to enable near-real-time visualization and assessment of conditions by radio operators."

        "abstract": "During the Phase I effort, we propose to develop algorithms and a prototype visualization tool to display point-to-point and point-to-area HF propagation parameters relevant to HF communications, including number of modes, mode attenuation, mode delay, etc. using a near-real-time ionospheric model updated with publicly available ionosphere\/beacon data and a 3D magneto-iono ray tracer.We will also develop algorithms to evaluate the prediction performance using both ionosphere measurements as well as link measurements.The Regional Optimal Assimilation Model (ROAM) developed by Boston College will serve as the primary assimilative ionospheric specification model. ROAM will be initialized by either the Regional Ionospheric Profile Estimation (RIPE) module developed by Boston College or the Ionosphere Real-Time Assimilative Model from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. The proposed HF Active Radio Propagation (HARP) model will use this near-real-time ionospheric state to estimate radio propagation parameters. HARP consists of two principal components, VOACAP, a well-established HF propagation model, and PHaRLAP, a 3D magneto-iono ray tracer that will be used for all ray tracing calculations. The key innovation in HARP is coupling these parameter prediction capabilities to a real-time ionospheric state. These propagation parameters will be displayed to the user via a customizable visualization tool."

        "abstract": "Timely and effective decision making to best protect and employ our space-based resources in complex evolving situations depends on rapid and perceptive multi-INT space situational awareness (SSA) in support of Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2). To achieve satisfactory SSA, the space community is increasingly turning to machine learning (ML) technology enabled by rapidly growing computing capacity and quantities of data. However, system developers face inherent challenges in applying ML technology that robustly satisfies current and future SSA needs. These include constantly changing sensors and other data sources, unforeseen contingencies, expanded SSA needs including assessing intentional behaviors, and continued growth in data volume and complexity. To address these requirements and provide a robust adaptive architecture for ML, we propose to design an innovative Multi-source Relational Situational Intelligence (MRSI) system. MRSI constructs and maintains relational models of evolving multi-domain situations from dynamic multi-INT evidence for SSA. Its ability to learn to recognize situations and their components creates opportunities for conveying multiple results to analysts and decision-makers as well as other systems in the form of actionable characterizations of the situation to aid overall SSA."

        "abstract": "As space becomes increasingly congested and contested space operators must rapidly assess threats with confidence to know what actions can be taken. Machine learning (ML) offers promise in efficiently dealing with these highly complex systems, however a major challenge is producing ML systems which are both robust and adaptable. Applied Defense Solutions (ADS) and the University of Texas at Austin propose to develop a Robust Adaptive Machine Learning (RAM) architecture for supporting decision making processes in the context of space battle management command and control. ADS will utilize ML techniques, both supervised and unsupervised, such as automated structure learning, physics guided data science, and active learning with user feedback. ADS will develop an architecture with predictive capability, based on past observation of patterns of life, with the ability to build relational correlations between disparate sources of data. ADS proposes five demonstration use cases to apply this RAM architecture. Training RAM algorithms requires large quantities of high quality data and ADS has access to unique space situational awareness data from its Global Optical Network."

        "abstract": "With the increase in new foreign launches and the number of agile or potentially separable satellites being placed into orbit, it is critical that the U.S. Air Force not only maintain custody of these satellites, but also quickly identify and interpret unusual behavior in complex and evolving multi-domain situations. To support decision making processes and enable rapid situational awareness, Numerica proposes to develop an Adaptive Pattern-of-Life Learning Operations system (APOLLO) that exploits multiple intelligence (multi-INT) data streams to provide automated indications and warnings (I&amp;Ws), event predictions, and associated confidence measures. APOLLO will build upon Numericas multi-INT event detection system, Athena, and be matured using historical and real-time data sources including data being produced by Numericas global telescope network. Through an innovative high-dimensional feature space representation of a satellites multi-INT spatial-temporal pattern of life, together with the application of powerful unsupervised machine learning techniques, APOLLO will support a number of use cases of interest to the Space Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) community. Particular attention will be given to developing and implementing approaches that adapt to changes in the baseline to reduce false alarms and missed detections, and that are robust to variability in data quality, quantity, and cadence."

We leverage evidence-based certification methodology and Safety Arguments (SAs) to map modifications to system architecture and behaviors. We integrate formal methods to build SAs that trace the impact of modifications through complex system interactions. AMPS connects SAs to critical design cases and system physics. The links with design cases maps SAs to engineering models and implements model-based recertification. The link with physics ensures SA sufficiency and overcomes confirmation\/cognitive biases. AMPS includes tools to analyze SAs, identify gaps and plan recertification. AMPS integrates into the DoD planning and acquisition cycle.We will leverage our experience with SA modeling user interfaces and data structures to design a cross-enterprise certification portal. Stakeholders will use the portal to generate SAs, map them to certification requirements and safety evidence. We will implement a deep learning text analytics subsystem to automatically identify certification requirements from thousands of pages of regulations. When information required to builds SAs is embedded in design documents, the deep learning subsystem will automatically identify pertinent information. AMPS will automatically pull data from engineering tools such as DOORS to support SAs. AMPS will drive SA reuse and Digital Twin."

The ultimate goal is to provide the war fighter with the best weapon systems possible on schedule and below initial cost estimates. To achieve this, more than Model Based System Engineering, Digital thread and Digital Twin (DT\/DTw) are required.The ability to understand the impact of aircraft certification must be considered. Certification can take the form of Air Worthiness, Assurance of Communications, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic (CNS-ATM) Compliance, along with future cyber security requirements\/certifications.These certifications currently create an unknow impact on cost and schedule which can have major impacts on the success or failure of the procurement.Historically, most certification guidance is specified using a text-based format that requires alignment with an aircraft systems design to fully understand the true impacts associated with certifying that design, engineering, cost and schedule.

        "abstract": "Combustion instability is an ongoing concern for military propulsion systems such as augmented gas turbine engines. Augmentor screech can limit the performance of military aircraft, and can cause durability issues or even catastrophic failure if it occurs. Modern augmentors have close-coupled fueling using simple round injectors to minimize manufacturing cost. In a jet-in-crossflow injector, liquid fuel issues from an orifice and the penetration of the fuel jet depends on the flowrate of fuel. Screech combustion instabilities are dependent on this static flame stability and thus are dependent on the penetration and atomization of the fuel jet. The prevalence of screech in the lower corner of the flight envelope is directly related to over-penetration of the fuel jets at the high fuel flow rate. Screech instabilities can be largely mitigated if a fuel injector is developed which produces a robust, largely invariant fuel distribution with good fueling of the flameholder wake. We propose to develop novel fuel injectors that are insensitive to fuel flow rate and thus engine operating condition. These injectors will more homogeneously fuel the augmentor over the flight envelope, leading to more robust combustion stability and reduced susceptibility to screech, mitigating screech before instability can initiate and grow."

The proposed hardware device concept is completely independent of any perforated liner and acts as an independent module that damps and leads to stabilization of the transverse pressure modes using a different physical mechanism than a liner."

Our techniques will enable highly accurate surface temperature measurement using the short-wave infrared imagery (SWIR) spectrum. A 3-D scanning system will also provide pointcloud data of hot components during operation. The system design can be optimized to eliminate the need for complex hardware cooling systems and allow for easy installation. During Phase I, we will design the system architecture, identify appropriate hardware, and develop a design for the Phase II system. We will also prototype our infrared imaging sensor and use it to measure temperature in laboratory testing. During Phase II, we will construct a fully-functional imaging system and demonstrate functionality during tests in an engine test cell."

        "abstract": "Apogee has been working since 2012 to develop thermal imaging systems for use on turbine engines to gather the thermal radiation and measure the temperature of rotor blades. Legacy instruments can only be applied to turbine test engines because the IR detectors have a need for liquid nitrogen cooling and require the penetration hole into the engine to be relatively large. If this technology can be made smaller and accessible using existing bore-scope inspection points, then these instruments can efficiently inspect production engines currently in use.Apogee proposes a method allowing its new instrument to be manufactured within the specifications of current state of the art turbine engines. This method is rugged and able to withstand the high (+1500F) temperatures associated within the engines combustion chamber. Apogees newest line of instruments utilize advanced software, efficient IR detection technology, novel cooling methods, and cost savings through high volume manufacturing practices. Apogees new thermal imager accesses a variety of turbine engines allowing inspection on-tarmac or on-wing allowing expensive depot maintenance intervals to be extended."

        "abstract": "During the Phase I, Baker Engineering Inc. (BEI) proposes to research the feasibility of developing an advanced micro-turbocharger that can be applied to small UAS propulsion systems in the 2-20 horsepower range. BEI will focus the research and design efforts on a micro-turbocharger to fit the 3W-28i propulsion platform (ScanEagle UAV). Incorporating a specially designed micro-turbocharger system on this 2 Hp engine would increase engine performance in areas such as takeoff power, efficiency, power at altitude, exhaust scavenging, and noise suppression. The smallest UAV propulsion system attests to be the most difficult application for a turbocharger system.A key benefit for the development of a micro-turbocharger for the 3W-28i engine is the potential to scale the system up for use in other applications under 20 hp. The Phase I study will include design, analysis, and sample part manufacturing. During a Phase II effort, BEI will incorporate data and results from the Phase I effort to develop, build and test the micro-turbocharger design. BEI will draw from previous turbocharger development expertise (OSD13-PR5) as well as hands-on knowledge of the 3W-28i engine for this new program.BEI is currently developing a larger advanced turbocharger under SBIR Phase II FA8650-16-C-2622."

The method is based on robust optimal control and optimization approaches enabled with machine-learning tools. The control system will be developed to optimize the energy distribution and handle constraints, such as the case where the battery state of charge (SOC) reaches its boundaries. The benefits of such an energy optimization scheme, in addition to optimizing the energy\/power\/fuel consumption for different flight scenarios are: providing a decision-making tool for HEP configuration selection (i.e., series, parallel, etc.), and insight for integration of new high-energy devices onboard the UAVs.The initial configuration of the powertrain architecture will consist of a gearbox, electric motors, power electronics, batteries, a clutch and an internal combustion engine. In Phase-I, we will develop a control architecture to optimize energy\/power distribution in small UAVs with HEP system, and conduct preliminary tests and verification of the algorithms at the software-level.In Phase-II, control hardware prototype for a small UAV will be demonstrated."

        "abstract": "The electric propulsion has several advantages over fossil fuel-based engines and power trains. They are more efficient, produce less noise, are easier to maintain and are cheaper to operate in the long run. However, they lag behind fossil fuels in one primary metric, the energy density. Even the most advanced battery systems do not come close to gasoline in terms of energy and weight ratio. Recently the focus has shifted towards a hybrid approach that promises to combine the benefits of both energy sources while limiting the drawbacks. In the realm of small Unmanned Air Vehicles (sUAV) electric propulsion is widely used. A hybrid propulsion implementation for sUAV has the potential to dramatically improve performance leading to longer flight time and ability to carry heavier payload. The balance between fossil fuel and electric is mission critical. Maintaining this balance under diverse mission objectives, environment conditions and uncertainties is a major challenge. The Efficient POwer Controller (EPOC) architecture is designed specifically for sUAV airframe, it uses an innovative ensemble approach for optimizing the partition of power source between battery and engine. Modern robust control methods are applied to ensure graceful degradation in performance and efficiency, as the UAV executes different maneuvers."

        "abstract": "The space launch community has been pursuing improvements in performance and efficiencies leading to higher specific impulses since the inception of rocketry. This effort has been largely successful reaching near theoretical limits for constant pressure combustion devices leaving little margin for higher specific impulses. Todays advances in traditional rocket engines focus on incremental improvements in performance and reducing development, fabrication, and launch costs. Alternative engine cycles, namely the continuous detonation cycle, offer the opportunity of significant, not incremental, launch capability increase simply through fundamental thermodynamic principles.Rotating detonation engines have recently gained interest across the world for using the detonation cycle to theoretically increase specific impulse by 10% over constant pressure combustion operation. Further, the detonation process converts the propellants to high temperature exhaust products at supersonic speeds allowing chambers less than 5% of the volume of constant pressure engines to be used and offering the potential for reduced inert mass and lower engine cost. IN Space proposes to evaluate the expansive RDE design space for space launch applications, select configurations with the potential to lower launch costs while increasing payload size, and produce a detailed path to retire development risks and mature the technology for these systems."

        "abstract": "Having previously designed, built and successfully tested a Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine (RDRE), GHKN Engineering proposes to evaluate the feasibility of RDRE technology for boost or upper stage propulsion for launch of small satellites to LEO. RDREs represent an innovative new rocket technology that harnesses the potential of continuous detonation combustion in elegant, compact, annular designs. Constant volume (detonation) combustion offers potential efficiency advantages over the constant pressure combustion (deflagration) used in current liquid rocket engines.In addition to remarkable stability, RDREs offer other potential advantages such as much smaller, more flexible envelopes, fast response times, wide ranges of stable operation, and a wide range of candidate fuels and oxidizers. Scale up from laboratory designs to thrust levels suitable for boost or upper stage application must be done in stages. GHKN proposes the first of those stages for this project. GHKN has enlisted the collaboration of small launch provider Vector Launch to conduct a system analysis of a potential RDRE-based propulsion system for their target market, and to develop a specification for a next-size-up modular test thruster. The GHKN team will then develop a preliminary design for the larger modular test thruster, and design a preliminary test program."

        "abstract": "The Air Force wants to develop novel cycles for liquid rocket engines that either exceed the performance of modern pressure-fed, expander, or gas generator cycles, and provides an overall system benefit such as reduced complexity or lower cost. In Phase I, we propose to compare quantitatively the thermodynamic cycles of a Rotating Detonation Engine with that of a conventional constant pressure combustion rocket engine over a range of conditions. This comparison will determine the efficiency and pumping work requirement for each cycle for key propellants including cryogenic LH2\/LOX and a hydrocarbon-based such as RP1-LOX. The RDE cycle will reduce the required fluid pressure entering the combustion chamber and consequently the work required by the turbopump. This has the potential of replacing the turbopump with a simpler electrically-driven pump powered by a battery. The pro and cons on the two cycles will be evaluated from a system point of view. In Phase II we will develop and perform risk reduction testing to demonstrate the potential performance increases and the operability\/cost improvements for the new engine."

The primary technology to be explored involves replacing the hydraulic circuit which generates needle motion with a more efficient direct acting system using a piezoelectric stack actuator. Efforts will include design, computational fluid dynamic analysis, fabrication and initial bench testing of injector actuation methods.Results from Phase I would be incorporated into new injector hardware which would be fabricated and tested during a Phase II program.

        "abstract": "When internal combustion engines are converted to heavy hydrocarbon fuels, such as JP-8, they become prone to knock, which reduces power and shortens engine life.One method for avoiding engine knock is establishing stratified fuel\/air charges within the cylinder, where near stoichiometric mixtures are retained in proximity to the point of ignition and lean elsewhere.However, generating stratified charges on small, high-speed engines, like those used for small UAVs is limited by the speed of the direct injection system.Busek proposes to develop a high-speed, piezo-actuated fuel injector for the purposes of fuel rate shaping to avoid engine knock in high speed engines.Rapid and controllable injection will be achieved by direct application of high force onto a prescribed incompressible volume, allowing for precise sub-millisecond actuation resolution while providing injection pressure amplification within the injector, thus reducing required fuel supply pressures.Relevant engines will be assessed and numerically modeled to ascertain optimum injection profiles for developing stratified charges.A proof-of-concept positive displacement actuator will be designed, fabricated, and tested via high speed imaging to confirm proper injector function at relevant time scales.Results shall be used to guide subsequent development of a prototype suitable for engine testing in Phase II."

The propulsion system is a key design constraint in any UAV, and current small gas turbines for these vehicles are limited by the conventional oil-lubricated rolling element bearings used to suspend their high-speed rotating assemblies. To address the limited life of rolling element bearings (REBs) and poor reliability of oil lubrication systems, Creare proposes an advanced hydrodynamic film bearing that will be lubricated by the engine fuel to provide reliable and maintenance-free operation. In Phase I, we will work with a small GTE manufacturer to define the ideal requirements for such a bearing, develop a design, fabricate a prototype, and test it in an existing test rig.In Phase II, we will further develop the novel bearing concept and retrofit it to an existing small gas turbine UAV propulsion system."

Xdot has developed a compliant foil bearing design that is ideally suited to meet the needs of this challenging application. This bearing design was specifically selected to provide state of the art performance using a configuration that can be produced in volume and at a price point that meets the needs of a broad variety of small, high speed turbomachinery.For this SBIR effort, Xdot Engineering and Analysis is proposing to accelerate the development of this foil bearing configuration to make it ready for low-risk, cost and schedule effective insertion into small oil-free gas turbine engines. The Phase I effort focuses on two key areas of Xdots technology portfolio: identification and validation of alternatives to PS304\/PS400 coatings, and high speed validation testing of a new thrust bearing configuration. Phase II will focus on bearing optimization and application risk reduction. The overall goal is to be ready for demonstration of a foil bearing supported small gas turbine engine using production ready foil bearings before the end of the Phase II effort."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using hydrodynamic air foil bearings (AFBs) or hybrid air foil bearings (HAFBs) with ultra-low friction, wear resistant and solid lubricant coatings to provide significant improvements in durability and cost reduction for small turbine engines for unmanned aerial vehicles. AFBs have simple construction, great service life, reduced maintenance and superior dynamic performance compared to traditional bearings such as rolling element bearings. More importantly, AFB systems are oil-free and expected to reduce total engine weight by up to 30%. In addition to hydrodynamic AFBs, HAFBs with increased load capacity at low speeds and enhanced rotordynamic stability will also be evaluated for infinite life. Acrees advanced tribological coatings provide superior wear characteristics and substantial improvement over Teflon or polyimide type coatings that are typically used on AFBs. The coatings are made of highly lubricious and extremely durable materials that reduce frictional heating and are resistant to scuffing and galling. The coatings are applied using Acrees Energetic Deposition Process which yields a highly dense and smooth film that does not require post-deposition grinding or polishing."

However, AF M315E has a higher surface tension than hydrazine and is harder to capture and move using existing propellant management devices (PMD) such as vanes or galleries. Lynntech proposes to develop an additively manufactured surface tension-based PMD for use in AF M315E storage tanks to move the monopropellant, thus eliminating the need for a bulky pressurization system and tank bladder which decreases satellite weight and cost. Lynntech will leverage its decade of experience with additive manufacturing to produce PMDs from prototype to flight-ready. Phase I will focus on design and determining the limits to feasibility. The new PMD will be scalable from nanosat applications up to large satellites."

        "abstract": "Highly efficient gas turbine engines require precise combustion, flow, and stability controls.To meet stringent future performance demands, engine control systems are transitioning to fully distributed networked architectures with smart sensors and actuators.While a networked control architecture has substantial benefits (e.g. reduced weight, improved robustness), it also presents new design challenges.The salient feature of networked architectures is a shared communications data bus with limited bandwidth and added latency.The performance of control algorithms is affected by the accuracy and rate at which data can be acquired from sensors and\/or commands sent to actuators over the shared bus.Likewise, excessive latency between the sensor input and actuator output can cause instability.Limited processing resources must also be considered.We propose a unified framework and methodology for modeling, simulation, iterative design and optimization of communication-aware distributed control-systems.The framework is built upon a novel model of computation and communication that supports deterministic behavior. It will allow us to assess design tradeoffs of alternative communication architectures and scheduling strategies to arrive at the optimized networked control system design, with potential for automated implementation and code generation for reduced defects and development time."

        "abstract": "Digital communication channels are used to send control commands from control computer to actuators, andtransmit sensor information to control computer. These data may be used for safety-critical purposes, or monitoringpurposes. There is a need for computing communication bandwidth margins under all conditions encountered bydistributed propulsion control systems. Distributed computing environments differ from conventional environmentsin that there is the presence of a databus over which all messages are passed along. Limits on communicationsystems can dramatically impact the efficiency of control laws. In the context of limited communications, however,it is possible to quantify the degradation of the quality of control by devising optimal attention control policies. Suchattention control policies are founded on the fact that not all measurements or control data share the same value at agiven instant. It is therefore necessary to design optimal actuator\/sensor scheduling policies that, given someavailable communication bandwidth, perform better than arbitrary scheduling policies. optoXense-Georgia-Techteam proposes optimal sensor\/actuator scheduling policies by solving appropriate convex-optimization probleminvolving LMIs. In Phase-I, we will assess design trade-offs in the embedded system communication architectureand develop concepts for optimal sensor\/actuator scheduling taking into consideration the impacts on controller and turbine-engine performance."

The Phase I research will produce a methodology, framework, and concept software tool that collects and fuses prognostics and sustainment data from a variety of sources in different formats with different content, produces sustainment decision data in the form of resource use, schedule, cost, and risk, and enables the user to view and modify sustainment actions at both the missile and fleet level to optimize sustainment decisions. The tool will provide insight into how prognostics can be leveraged in specific ways (such as acquisition lead times, workload balancing, and optimizing resource use) to determine the most cost-effective sustainment actions. A case study will be conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, and will show how the concept can be used with multiple data sources. The ultimate goal of this effort will be to demonstrate the feasibility of the predictive missile sustainment and reliability concept that satisfies the objectives and provides sufficient evidence to support further development in a Phase II effort."

The capability will be provided as a stack of analytics functions that collect and fuse maintenance, test, inspection, and engineering data from multiple data streams, formats, and sources. The analytics in the stack will identify most urgent sustainment needs based on sensor data and results of non-destructive tests. They will provide lifetime prediction based on ambient condition exposure history and using aging models that implement physical principles and physics-based understanding. They will further predict fleet reliability and maintainability issues such as entering the wear-out phase for subsystems. Finally, the analytics will define the optimal resources on most pressing sustainment issues, such as reducing costly premature and unnecessary component replacement or maintenance. The analytics will be applicable to most ICBM subsystems. The capability development in this project will build upon knowledge and experience accumulated in aviation sustainment and in the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) domain. Analytics approaches from these domains will be adapted to ICBM sustainment."

It will enable movement ofdata between Secret, Top Secret, and Program security levels for use within ARCADE\/JMS and other BMC2 systems for a variety of enterprise C2 activities. Delivery of the EGS data to higher classification levels allowsACCESS to provide greater operational context to the warfighter by fusing exploited satellite telemetry data with other data sources across the community."

We intend to improve the EoL efficiency of ELO DJ cells by the application of wavelength specific photonic structures at the back of the solar cell and also reducing GaAs subcell thickness of the DJ cell. The grapheme assisted remote epitaxy and subsequent exfoliation will help in developing a fast turn around epitaxiallift-off process, which can help in cost reduction."

        "abstract": ":In military satellite communication (MILSATCOM), the downlink transmission signals suffer from nonlinear distortions caused by the high power amplifier (HPA) of the satellite transponder, which can be characterized as amplitude modulation-to-amplitude modulation (AM-AM), and amplitude modulation-to-phase modulation (AM-PM) effects. To solve this problem, Intelligent Fusion Technology, Inc. (IFT) and its university partner California State University propose three different predistortion (PD) solutions depending on current and future MILSATCOM system configurations, and potential modification cost, which are near-term on-ground solution, mid-term on-board solution, and long-term combined on-ground and on-board solution. In this proposal, we mainly focus on the near-term on-ground solution due to its lowest cost of implementation. In this solution, a physical model-based PD and a machine learning-based PD controller will be developed to predict the nonlinearity of the HPA in the presence of the jamming signals. Various advanced techniques such as extended Salehs HPA model, PD modeling architectures, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are applied in the physical model-based PD, while the PD controller is obtained by training a sophisticated deep and reinforcement learning (DRL) model using suitable signal and HPA characteristics datasets, which are generated by the IFT MILSATCOM emulators developed in our prior work."

The pre-distortion will work within the bandwidths of the existing hardware and does not require any new ADCs\/DACs.This offers a significant advantage as space-qualified ADC\/DACs lag in performance to the latest state of the art in terms of resolution, as well as the sampling rate. To overcome the resolution and sampling rate limitation, we are proposing a band-limited real-time predistortion system, reducing the required sampling rate by more than 2 times compared to conventional DPD systems.The Phase 1 work will simulate an adaptive bandlimited DPD system for a satellite SSPA\/TWT system including multicarriers and jammers and show its benefits. The phase 2 work will demonstrate the prototype system."

The micro-air-vehicle will be able to carry a five pound payload for 25 minutes while being compact enough to fit through a door.Using AVID proprietary design tools, trade studies that include costs, rotor size, weight, and endurance will be performed on identified configurations to down select to a single design. Testing of representative propulsion and control configurations components will be performed to reduce risk for follow on development. Further analysis and refinement of the down selected design will result in a prototype ready to be manufactured."

The design will include a feasibility and performance analysis, including a sensitivity study regarding relaxation of the size constraint. An existing optimizer framework will be upgraded during this phase. Because the optimizer is capable of arbitrary, non-coplanar configurations (orientations and positions of homo\/heterogeneous rotors) and a compact size is desired, a inter-rotor interference model will be developed to increase the fidelity of the optimizers designs.This model will be built and solidified using thrust stand data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Our current, novel vehicle design is inspired by two empirical discoveries made by the team dealing with increasing hover efficiencies by vectoring of the inter-rotor wakes.The design vectors wakes with no extra moving parts, and provides full actuation to the vehicle for almost no loss in hover efficiency.This allows the vehicle to have superior handling in tight spaces, such as indoor environments. Finally, the selected optimized design of vehicle will be evaluated in simulation, prototyped and flight tested."

NanoSonic&apos;s HybridSil aerospace foams will be tailored to serve as a drop-in replacement for current foam parts and not require any aircraft modification. To meet this challenge, NanoSonic will employ a rigorous design of experiments that will enable the correlation and combinatorial optimization of critical structure-property interdependencies affording next-generation reticulated aerospace foams that exceed the Air Force&apos;s chemical resistance, electrical resistivity, mechanical durability, and weight performance metrics. NanoSonic will also demonstrate the ability to precisely tailor the electrical resistivity of down-selected foams through the use of high aspect ratio conductive fillers. This program will build from NanoSonic&apos;s innovative blast protective, fire resistant HybridSil foam technology , which has an established flame spread rating of zero; produces low density smoke, affords low average heat release rates, and has exceptional vertical burn resistance. In support of a near term Phase III transition into a broad spectrum of aerospace platforms, NanoSonic has received strong integration interest from Lockheed Martin."

        "abstract": "Aerospace platforms require many multi-functional, advanced material solutions as part of their structure in order to provide superior performance and mission capability. One such material is an electrically resistive, reticulated foam material that is installed within aircraft structures.Due to their proximity to fuel tanks, they cannot be completely isolated from aircraft fuel and hydraulic fluids. Foams are not resistant to hydrocarbon fluids, and upon exposure absorb and retain the organic fluids and thus alter their density and create a significant fire hazard. As a result, there is a compelling need for an innovative material solution.The ideal replacement material would be durable, fluid-resistant, flexible for aircraft deflection, and also provide tunable electrical resistivity properties. Chemists at Luna recently developed a class of functional hybrid polymers that demonstrated exceptionally high fluid resistance to hydrocarbon fluids. Incorporation of these novel polymers within an electrically resistive foam is expected to provide superior fluid resistance and reduced volume swell for an open cell system. The proposed Phase I effort will focus on developing this foam material with an emphasis on meeting the target density ( 5.5 lb\/ft3), electrical properties (2-18 GHz) and fluid permeability (SAE J2665) requirements as outlined by the Air Force."

        "abstract": "Lithium ion batteries are being used extensively in several areas including the USAF ICBM due to their high energy density, reliability and performance. The high energy density also poses unique challenges such as fires and explosions. Failure in a single cell can rapidly spread tothe battery pack compromising the entire operation and personnel safety. We propose the development of a large format Li ion battery that is comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art in terms of energy density and performance, but is extremely safe against hazards like short circuits, overheat and overcharge (that can lead to thermal runaway in COTS batteries). Our technology is based on passive early detection of such failures and prevention of conditions that can lead to thermal runaway. This protects each individual cell in the battery pack that in turn eliminates the cell-to-cell propagation of failure. We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed concepts on COTS large format Li ion batteries in Phase I, and develop custom large format batteries with our technology embedded in it in Phase II. We will deliver prototype batteries to the Air Force at the end of Phase II for further evaluation."

These coatings will improve stability and satisfy critical safety requirements for batteries. Engineering electrolytes with both solid and liquid design features will maximize rate capability and durability over the required temperature range (-40 to +75 C operational and -55 to +85 C storage). Additionally, Corvid will collaborate with Saft America Inc. to assure the solution is scalable and cost competitive.

        "abstract": "The Air Force stores some critical components in steel, cubic shaped chambers.These chambers are underground and are encased with reinforced concrete.There is no direct access to the concrete, making inspection very difficult.We propose to develop a nondestructive system to detect, locate, and assess degradation of reinforced concrete encasing the steel chambers.We propose use of piezoelectric based assessment of stress waves produced directly by degradation processes.Acoustic emission testing is well established for inspecting accessible reinforced concrete.We propose to adapt these methods to inspecting reinforced concrete behind steel plate.Concrete is highly attenuating so direct measurement on concrete require numerous sensors.We will test the ability of the steel plate to act as a waveguide for the AE energy, allowing effective concrete inspection with fewer sensors.Our LAHMPTM system will be modified specifically to perform the automated diagnostic and prognostic calculations developed in this research program.In Phase I we will: construct steel reinforced concrete blocks with steel plates on one side; accelerate damage to the blocks; piezoelectrically monitor the blocks both directly (on concrete) and indirectly (through steel plate); modify damage detection algorithms to account for the steel;customize LAHMP; and prepare for Phase II\/III."

Conductive Composites Company (CCC) has a unique understanding of the problem and has spent the past three decades developing and manufacturing a suite of multifunctional composite materials to meet demanding requirements. Our approach employs a ceramic honeycomb core panel with a small amount of ceramic fiber in the honeycomb cells for thermal buffering. In addition, we propose using Gadolinium(III) oxide as an inorganic compound as a material to block nuclear particles such as neutrons and x-rays. A layer of electromagnetic protection will be applied and co-cured to the back of the panel, using high temperature soluble thermoplastic polyimide with our highly conductive materials dispersed within. This Phase I effort will result in a 12&quot; by 12&quot; flat panel coupon capable of meeting MIL-STD-416, 464, and 3023 that will be tested in accordance with &quot;The Nuclear Matters Handbook, Expanded Edition&quot; Appendix G4.1."

The proposed research by Goodman Technologies, Nuclear Radiation Hardening Associates, and the University of Hawaii (a Navy UARC) team will benefit the ICBM, cruise missile and hypersonic weapon industries by dramatically increasing the survivability of the electronics and materials within the aeroshell.We will use cure-on-the fly, nanoresin, and nanotape technologies with current composite manufacturing braiding and winding techniques to produce nanocomposites with SE superior to the Mk-21 aeroshell, while also having layers of low Z and high Z materials to harden against neutrons, x-rays and gamma rays. We will use a very innovative ablation-sublimation layer for cooling during hypersonic reentry. Our technology provides the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center ICBM Directorate a retrofit opportunity for Minuteman III sustainment as well as a potential design for Ground Based Strategic Deterrent and other strategic air platforms and cruise missiles."

        "abstract": "The U.S. Air Force needs to non-destructively and easily inspect thermal spray metallic and ceramic thermal spray coatings on critical surfaces of gas turbines. Current methods fail to adequately detect sub-surface and interfacial defects, and are cumbersome to use, particularly with conformal geometries.Issues exist with capturing accurate measurements over a range of coating and substrate materials. Finally, inspection data must be interpreted by skilled operators that are subject to misinterpretation.Grid Logic has developed the foundation for a new non-destructive inspection technology called Micro-Induction Inspection (MII). This technology uses an ultra-high frequency resonant circuit inductively coupled to a substrate to measure the characteristics of a composite test sample. The technique is not only sensitive to variations in the substrate surface, but also to sub-surface and interfacial variations. In this Phase I project, MII sensors will be developed that are tuned to the materials used in metallic and ceramic thermal sprays on jet turbines. The potential for a system will be demonstrated to precisely detect flaws by measuring complex impedance variations. The project will establish a foundation for development of a full-scale non-destructive evaluation system in Phase II that can be easily used by the Air Force."

This proposal provides a path to automated, real time assistance to inspectors while they perform these complex tasks.For this effort TRI Austin has teamed with Computational Tools to develop and demonstrate real time automated assistance for the inspector both with the manual performance and interpretation of results. For the Phase I effort, we will concentrate on angle beam UT for fatigue cracks in multi-layer metallic structures.We propose to design a real-time software, an Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) Assistant, and specific technique instructions to enable use of this technology without requiring any encoder.TRI Austin will perform angle beam shear wave UT inspections of simple coupons with holes and fatigue cracks and\/or notches. Simulation will be performed to determine optimal probe positioning, and timing of signals in the A scan indicative of a crack. Algorithms will be implemented to read the active A scans and overlay information on the live A scan, based on the geometry and model results, to assist the inspector in interpretation."

        "abstract": "Welding of aerospace structural components is an expensive process due to high material cost of titanium alloys, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. Linear friction welding (LFW) is a solid state process of joining materials together through frictional contact. Due its several advantages like absence of solidification defects and additional heat source, the technique is increasing attracting attention in aerospace industry. However, there is a need to develop process modeling capabilities, which enable optimization and effective of LFW.Commercially available finite element software are limited to modeling of linear friction welding in 2D using Finite Element Method (FEM) with Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian adaptive mesh controls. However, 2D modeling does not allow for full and accurate accounting of deformation in all directions at the weld line. Currently, there is no means to effectively model LFW process in 3D structural components. 3D process modeling via FEM with adaptive meshing technique is computationally expensive, and presents numerical errors due to extensive distortion of elements.ACT proposes to develop a novel approach for process modeling of friction welding in 3D. The approach will handle the deformation and weld processes of LFW efficiently and enable optimization of process for aerospace components."

These coatings are a critical component of the CMCs, but current generation evaluation methods like scanning electron microscopy and Auger depth profiling are slow, sample only small areas, and are destructive. Confocal Scanning Raman Microscopy (CSRM) offers substantially increased scanning speeds compared to electron microscopy. We will produce a CSRM system designed for rapid chemical characterization of coatings over large fabric surface areas for CMC applications. We will demonstrate that CSRM is capable of identifying oxidation and other critical defects in this coatings relevant to CMC applications. The Phase I effort will identify the imaging and data processing conditions necessary to apply CSRM to BN and Si3N4 coatings on fiber fabrics and design a prototype CSRM system. In Phase II, we will produce that prototype system, integrate it into our manufacturing environment, and translate the imaging conditions to more rapid resonant scanning techniques expanding the types of defects characterized."

The ZIDPA antenna will measure 1 deep, 2 wide, and 4 long, and weigh under 140 lbs. The ZIDPA also offers high directivity, a constant phase-center across frequency, low time-domain ringing, smooth main beam patterns, gain that increases monotonically with frequency, low backlobe and sidelobe levels, and a 95% volume reduction over a 1001100 MHz dual-ridged horn. Its compact size and reduced weight make it logistically friendly to transport and image underside aircraft features - including bomb bay door seals. Development of the ZIDPA provides the USAF with a method to reduce Phase II design risk for a compact UHF\/VHF antenna that is intended for use by 5-Level maintainers."

        "abstract": "CTG believes the way to advance the state-of-the-art in compact UHF\/VHF antenna design is to approach it from a somewhat unconventional paradigm. Over the last few years, CTG has developed a line of near-field spot probe microwave antennas that have found effective use as Tier-1 sensors in a variety of applications. Integral to CTGs design is the incorporation of dielectric materials optimized as part of the antenna design. This combined dielectric\/metal antenna results in a wide bandwidth but still very compact antenna. Taking this probe antenna as design inspiration, CTG proposes a new concept in UHF\/VHF sensors: Flat Lens Antenna Technology (FLAT). This new paradigm draws inspiration from CTGs previous AMMP technology, but with several new innovations that reduce size and weight without sacrificing performance. Rather than trying to reduce the antenna thickness in the propagation direction, the FLAT design instead shrinks the antenna perpendicular to the propagation direction. Maintaining a reasonable length parallel to propagation allows the FLAT antenna to still have sufficient directivity for field-deployable diagnostic applications. More importantly the initial design simulations demonstrate that FLAT will enable antennas that are smaller and lighter than current state-of-the-art horns, but with similar performance."

        "abstract": "The machining of aerospace materials such as Titanium (Ti) and Nickel (Ni) alloys are a costly and timely task in the production of any aircraft for the US Air Force and can be an inhibitor of advancing next generation aircraft designs. The recent development and production availability of cryogenic systems has provided a technology for suppliers of aerospace components to decrease both costs and turnaround time required for these exotic Ti and Ni alloy machined components; however, the current commercial availability of internally-cooled cryogenic-specific cutting tools (ICCT) as well as the current performance capability of ICCT have limited the wide adoption of cryogenic systems into the US Air Force supply network. With the development of new ICCT designs, materials, and coatings along with the advancements in cryogenic modeling software, the manufacturing readiness level (MRL) of ICCT will be increased to a MRL maturity level 8 by the completion of Phase-III of this multi-phase project. Along with the increase in MRL maturity, the advancements in ICCT tool designs, materials, and coatings will allow for an increase in the machining capabilities by further elevating the material removal rates (MRR) and tool life beyond even that currently possible with cryogenic machining."

        "abstract": "Advanced R&amp;D breakthroughs in integrated photonics, in parallel with the launch of the Advanced Institute for Manufacturing: Photonics (AIM Photonics), make feasible the production of manufacturable photonic integrated circuits (PIC).Presently, however, PICs are limited primarily to a small wavelength region (near 1550nm) dictated by telecom needs, or rely on glass waveguide technology that does not permit compact form factors. NorCon Technolgies proposes to advance state-of-the-art PIC sensor technology by developing several innovative connectors for mating enhanced-wavelength (UV through LWIR) specialty fibers to high-volume manufactured, integrated silicon or silicon nitride sensor PICs.These connector approaches will be modeled with state-of-the-art simulation software such as Fimmwave and Lumerical.Fabrication of the connectors will make use of a maskless lithography, which provides for rapid turnaround and several prototype iterations within the time scale of the Phase I program.The wavelength range targeted for Phase I is 0.5 microns to 5.5 microns covering most of the visible, NIR, SWIR, and MWIR.The connector approaches will be mainly be characterized by the optical insertion loss, as well as ease of alignment and wavelength dependence."

Particularly compelling would be fibers and fiber-based functional elements capable of transmitting laser power with low loss over a wide wavelength range from UV to LWIR. NP Photonics proposes to develop ultra-wide wavelength covering fiber-based optical components, such as fiber combiners, based on our novel tellurite glass fiber. This fiber material has low loss transparency over a wide range from 400nm to 5000nm, and can be used to couple laser power from semiconductor, solid state, and fiber lasers into a single fiber aperture, and in turn serve as multiplexing and de-multiplexing elements. The advantages of the proposed fiber combiner are: all-fiber format, low loss, ultra-wide wavelength coverage, high beam quality, high reliability and robustness."

Recovered fuel that is contaminated (water, sediment, hydraulic and\/or engine oil) may adversely affect equipment life resulting in unnecessary maintenance costs.FTL Labs Corporation (FTL) proposes HHB-1, a two-part solution that both separates offloaded fuels and oils during maintenance operations, and further purifies the offloaded fuel to an acceptable level for use in ground support equipment servicing the flight line. HHB-1 is a high volume, low cost, portable fuel purifier suitable for many, if not all, flight line and depot operations. In Phase I, FTL will identify requirements and key performance parameters (e.g. filtering efficiency, flow rates, etc.) by conducting program office and flight line interviews, designing the HHB-1 flight line fuel purification system, and identifying likely system procurement costs."

This composite repair is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process that is prone to technician-dependent repair quality. Part of the repair process involves fabricating a temporary female tool for patch ply lay-up, and is particularly time-consuming because two molds have to be made, both of which have long cure times (8-hours each). Systems &amp; Materials Research Corporation (SMRC) will develop ScarfRep, an automated scarf replication and repair system to support aircraft outer mold line composite repair using a pre-cured block to make the temporary female tool. In Phase I, feasibility of ScarfRep will be proven by demonstrating the production of temporary female tooling directly by machining pre-cured plaster-like blocks eliminating the time-consuming cure steps in the current process. The block fabrication process is enabled by using structured light scanning to acquire scarf geometry, and convert this information into tool paths for CNC machining. The ScarfRep temporary female tooling will be used to form epoxy and bismaleimide composite hard patches that meet quality and dimensional tolerance requirements."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in printed electronics provide solutions that reduce the cost, complexity, and energy requirements of conventional deposition methods. When evaluating production systems and processes, many designers and manufacturers often neglect ink conductivity, customization and cost. Advantageously, nanoparticle-based inks have lower curing temperatures than those typically needed for bulk curing where larger particles of the same material are used. By producing a low-temperature, air-stable copper solution, high performance and lower-cost metallization on substrates such fabric, cellulose, and plastics could be deposited. In Phase-I project, Texas Biochemicals will formulate a stable copper solution that can be deposited in ambient conditions. Our novel material design process creates well dispersed copper nanoparticles homogeneously coated with low-volatile organic molecule protects pure nano metal particles from atmospheric attack and coating enables great particle dispersion in inks, making printing simple. The copper nano inks will be customized to control factors such as substrate compatibility, particle chemistry, and protection from attack by external substances. Collaboration with a leading prime contractor is established to evaluate samples and providetechnical guidance.Their input described under Phase I tasks and the letter of support attached demonstrates their intention to become a commercialization partner leading to near term technology utilization potential."

(2) formulation of the nanoinks to enable printable and ambient-temperature sinterable capability on flexible plastic and paper substrates; and (3) characterization of the electrical properties of the sintered conductive patterns on the flexible substrates.

        "abstract": "Compression-molded short-fiber composite (SFC) materials have several advantages over metallic and continuous-fiber composite (CFC) materials, including greater part complexity, improved dimensional stability, and low-cost\/high-volume production.However, introduction of novel SFC material systems is stymied by the need to perform costly and time-consuming testing programs to generate allowables, design values, mechanical properties, and statistical distributions thereof. To provide this information earlier in the product design cycle, ATA Engineering proposes to extend an existing composite material property prediction framework (COMPAS) for applicability to SFC materials by developing two new analytic modules. The first module, a data mining utility (DMU), will interrogate a material database of SFC and like CFC materials to (1) fit characteristic equations that represent property trends as a function of material parameters and (2) utilize an innovative collaborative filtering algorithm to predict unknown SFC material properties. The second module is a physics-based multiscale finite element modeler, which will employ an enhanced binary modeling approach to explicitly represent the fiber microstructure, resin matrix, and interface in part-scale meshes to simulate material response.The Phase I effort will provide proof of concept for the software tools and analytic methods prior to extensive development and validation in Phase II."

The goal of the proposed research is to leverage an extensive existing composite database and extend a methodology demonstrated to aid in reducing the cost and\/or schedule of allowables test programs for continuous fiber composites to develop and validate a computational tool specifically designed for short fiber composites. The resulting database tool would account for the unique parameters of short fiber materials and permit cross-correlation with continuous fiber material properties in order to develop relations that can lead to improved estimates of short fiber composite allowables and, when supplemented by limited physical testing, reduce the time and cost associated with experimental characterization for this material form, as well as contributing to the ability of engineers to design\/tailor new short fiber composite forms."

The PBWR system will complement other existing radar systems, demonstrating interoperability with existing communications networks, power sources and computing nodes and eliminating custom support equipment that must be carried into the field. Software-defined radar transceivers and processing\/control nodes will allow for flexibility in the bi-static receivers under different operating conditions and software-driven system upgrades, as well as extensibility of the radar sensor for other future missions. The Phase I effort will focus on studying the feasibility of the bi-static concept and developing system concepts for implementing the bi-static radar system.

The next-generation solution developed to enhance the military weather sensing capability will provide deployed units with improved performance to better understand battlefield conditions.Developing a light-weight bistatic Doppler weather radar system requires assembling the best team in the industry, whose experts nearly guarantee a final system that simultaneously can meet the opposing requirements of a robust, low-cost, and high-performance system that can be quickly and easily deployed and operated. FIRST RF Corporation has brought together world-class partners in weather radar and systems engineering to complement our innovative and robust military product heritage.

A VCSEL is a semiconductor-based laser diode that emits a highly efficient optical beam vertically from its top surface.Active lens alignment\/collimation of the emitting light for a VCSEL is time-consuming and relatively expensive today.GCI proposes creating a variety of lens sizes, shapes, and pitches with additive manufacturing to execute a design of experiments (DOE) to develop a more efficient and cost-effective passive VCSEL collimation process.The Phase I is designed to assess the manufacturability of a wafer-level collimating process using a two dimensional intensity map alignment process with a fish eye to monitor the collimated intensity. We anticipate initially using an 850 nm wavelength option, while attempting to gang a VCSEL array to increase power and intensity output. The Phase II will concentrate on passive lens development and integration using a conformal coating that is disrupted and self-aligned by the emitting VCSEL emission."

        "abstract": "Military sensor models comprise software codes that represent specific sensor technologies, such as infrared, radar, and LiDAR, so that sensor systems can be designed and integrated into Air Force platforms.Operating these codes requires system designers to expend considerable effort in translating the inputs and outputs of the various codes so that they interface properly. Integrating multiple sensor models is a daunting task, particularly as the number of sensor models increases.What is needed, and what ThermoAnalytics (TAI) intends to provide, is a System-of-Systems (SoS) environment with capability to integrate the operation of the full suite of senor models of interest to the Air Force.ThermoAnalytics will develop a governing software integration tool that provides operation capability of multiple sensor models from a single system simulation environment (SIMEN) by adapting our commercially successful SoS software tool, CoTherm.Standardized configuration files, intermediate data files\/structures, and custom Application Program Interfaces (API) will be used to link the models without requiring changes to the native format.The SoS setup procedure will be widely adaptable to reduce the number of labor hours required to create an integrated SoS model using a wide range of disparate sensor models."

We propose to design and prototype Varied Interface &amp; Phenomenology Engineering Relationship Suite (VIPERS), an environment for SoS simulation that leverages these existing investments.Component integration will be automated using the Machine Learning technique of Surrogate Modeling (SM), which constructs high-fidelity emulations from model data. SM enables 1) very fast execution; 2) unified software interfaces; and 3) a universal approach for replacing complex models in integrated simulations. Our approach uses intelligent closed-loop adaptive sampling methods, enabling the construction of high-fidelity SMs with reduced computation and analytic effort. SM takes real-world experimental data into account more readily than traditional component models, with appropriate weighting of confidence and uncertainty. SMs provide universal, data-driven models that capture highly detailed trends with accurate prediction power and known uncertainties, while simultaneously eliminating most integration overhead."

By the end of Phase I, IAI team will demonstrate the feasibility of the Proof of concept DeepFrame tool. DeepFrame will provide a capability to bring disparate models together into a single simulation environment.IAI team with help from AFRL Layered Sensing Exploitation Division will develop at least one use case that will be comprised of radar, SAR, electro optical (camera), tracking and possibly other sensor subsystem models from varying MBE toolsets. This will lay a solid framework for Phase II in which we plan to develop all aspects of DeepFrame into a functional prototype software tool with demonstrated ability to integrate disparate codebases with minimal human intervention."

The Phase I project will demonstrate the scientific, technical and commercial potential of TRIP. Specific areas the team will address include: (i) tunable OAM generation and detection, (ii) high OAM mode purity, (iii) efficient OAM multiplexing and demultiplexing, (iv) integration of TRIP array, and (v) OAM beam steering using TRIP. In addition, the team will develop Phase II\/III plans for fabricating and testing TRIP. In Phase II, the team will build on the initial Phase I design to build and test TRIP and evaluate its performance versus current state of the art transmission links and secure communication channels. In the Phase III, R-DEX will work with its academic and industrial partners to further develop TRIP for both Government and commercial applications."

Additionally, particular focus is given to multi-path environments of the modern, urban battlefield, which can compound existing threats and limitations, yielding current solutions inoperable. Specific technologies to investigated, which are currently under development by the proposing team, include: digital beamforming using sparse arrays, and machine learning assisted mapping of multi-path environments."

        "abstract": "GPS denial is a growing threat to military and civilian operations around the world, both through active jamming and through anticipated failure of an aging GPS satellite constellation. While active jamming can be circumvented with specialized circuitry, obtaining position, navigation, and timing (PNT) during satellite failure remains an unsolved and growing problem. In collaboration with AFRL personnel at the Starfire Optical Range, Kirtland AFB, Nokomis developed the Satellite Identification, Tracking, and Health (SITH) network as a way of locating Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites on the basis of their radio transmissions. Nokomis proposes to use the SITH framework, with a potential accuracy of 0.1 m, to provide PNT signals for GPS-denied environments. SITH-PNT will rely on a dense and growing constellation of active, RF-transmitting, commercial LEO satellites already in orbit. This constellation will ensure that a highly robust, multiply redundant mechanism is always in place to provide PNT signals, even in the event of GPS satellite malfunction or failure. By adapting the SITH network, the proposed SITH-PNT framework aims to provide accurate PNT signals for L2C carriers with a target resolution of 100 ns in Phase I."

        "abstract": "Aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) have been used for decades by public, commercial and military firefighting organizations to fight hydrocarbon fires. AFFFs containing fluorinated surfactants have superior firefighting capabilities, but many are classified as persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic. As a result, new, reliable, environmentally-friendly, fluorine-free firefighting foam concentrates for use on class B liquid pool fires are needed. In addition to being environmentally friendly and non-toxic, the new agent must provide the same level of fire protection as fluorinated AFFFs. In response to this need, TDA Research, Inc. has developed a fire-fighting foam concentrate (3%) that does not contain fluorosurfactants or any fluorinated compounds (i.e., is fluorine-free), is compatible with current fire-fighting hardware and fire-fighting protocols, and meets the fire performance requirements of AFFF when measured with a Type III Fire Test for Class B fires as described in Section 10 of the Standard UL 162 (Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. Northbrook, IL, Eighth Edition, February 23, 2018).In this project, TDA will optimize and scale-up production of the formulation in order to support large scale fire testing."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for an indoor GPS satellite constellation antenna array, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Scalable Dynamic GPS Broadband Patch Antenna Array (SPAN) system. The proposed array is based on the novel integration of the broadband GPS-band smart antenna arrays coupled with EMI-immune fiber-optic interface between SPANs unique orbit-like platform located in anechoic chamber and GPS multichannel signal simulator\/SPAN control system, positioned in the control room. Twenty-four independent antenna arrays and realistically scaled spatial distribution of moving orbits ensure that up to 12 satellite antenna beams can be simultaneously seen by the stationary positioned unit under test (UUT). The RF-over-fiber interface enables single snap connectorization to all output channels of GPS simulation system and supports UUT tests with GPS L1 C\/A, P(Y) and M-Noise codes and GPS L2 C\/A or P(Y) and L2C, M-Noise codes. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate SPANs feasibility by modeling, including SPANs structure design, precision-control algorithm, and fiber optic interface development. In Phase II, we plan to fully develop the prototype indoor GPS satellite constellation antenna array. At the end of Phase II, the SPAN prototype will be ready for testing at an Army test facility."

In Phase I, Sentient will demonstrate that an in-process sensor measured thermograph can be successfully linked to different types of defects on the build surface, and Sentients DCC model can be used to optimize the process parameters and correct known defects. The corrected part will be experimentally tested to show improved material properties and reduced residual stress in Phase I option. In Phase II, Sentient will partner with Sikorsky to further develop this flaw detection-correction technology into a closed-loop application in an AM process, and select suitable components in Army helicopter gearbox to demonstrate the developed application. It is expected that at the end of Phase II, the developed technique will meet the goal of this solicitation with an in-process method that can improve the repeatability of the material properties, geometry and quality of AM manufactured aluminum parts."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for generation of configuration data and a framework for simulation and verification of future vertical lift (FVL) aircraft systems against specifications, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Avionics Compositional System of Systems (SoS) Simulation and Modeling Tool Chain (ASSIST). Using avionics system specifications, ASSIST generates mission-specific configurations by modeling system interdependencies and configuring avionics system\/components to meet desired mission goals. Using system configuration data as input, ASSIST can set up integrated avionics SoS integrated test and evaluation (IT&amp;E) frameworks using standard object models (OMs) and middleware, generated automatically from configuration data. The innovation in ASSIST enables early detection of defects and verification of avionics functionality against specifications. Detection and rectification of defects, particularly in integrated avionics systems, early in the product lifecycle through simulation-based IT&amp;E directly address the Armys requirements for the Joint Multi-Role project for the FVL program. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of ASSIST and reach TRL-3 by implementing configuration data generation and creation of a prototype IT&amp;E environment. In Phase II, POC plans to mature ASSIST further and reach TRL-5 by including support for diverse heterogeneous systems and a more extensive OM and middleware repository."

        "abstract": "This proposal seeks to advance the next generation of portable energy storage by exploiting the high specific energy intrinsic to the Li-S system. While sulfurs low electrical conductivity and the inhibiting effects of polysulfide dissolution have historically impeded the commercialization of Li-S batteries, we propose to overcome these limitations via the utilization of graphene as a multifunctional component. Our approach leverages this 2D nanomaterial to act as (i) an electrically conductive agent, (ii) a polysulfide trap to circumvent active material loss, (iii) a robust framework to buffer volume expansion during cycling, and (iv) a wrapping agent to build uniform and spherical particles for better electrode casting. Because polysulfide dissolution is a multifaceted problem affecting the entire cell, we shall also investigate a graphene-protected anode and non-flammable electrolyte to improve cycle life performance and overall battery safety.By completion of Phase I, we intend to demonstrate a low cost (&lt; $10\/kg), high areal density (&gt; 10 mg\/cm2) cathode exhibiting improved cycle life and capacity retention bolstered by our graphene-protected anode and electrolyte formulation. In consideration of these outcomes, and our intent co-develop this technology with several industrial customers, we truly believe DoDs advanced energy goals can be realized through our approach."

        "abstract": "As tactical and deployed electrical power demands increase for soldiers, there is a commensurate need to increase the energy density of military batteries (i.e. man portable power) to ease the weight burden additional power capacity entails. Lithium-sulfur batteries, as replacement for current lithium ion batteries, are a promising advancement with theoretical specific energy of 2600Wh\/kg and demonstrated specific energy of 300 to 550Wh\/kg. With the specific energy potential of the Li-S chemistry, implementation in a variety of standard configurations could significantly reduce battery and\/or pack weight and size. However, Li-S batteries still require maturation to harness their potential. The most significant issues affecting Li-S batteries are related to the dissolution of sulfur in the cathode and migration of lithium polysulfides in organic liquid electrolyte used in the cell, resulting in reduced sulfur utilization and capacity fading over time\/cycling. The proposed work seeks to develop Li-S cell materials that address these challenges to enable high energy density storage."

The attached proposal shows how the disciplined oscillator signal can be used to improve GPS carrier and code tracking, mitigate multipath, jamming and spoofing, and to detect GPS receiver and satellite system anomalies. Using the disciplined oscillator as the frequency reference inside the GPS receiver itself results in better jamming and spoofing immunity, faster re-acquisition, direct-Y code acquisition after a cold-start, and complete removal of the 1PPS sawtooth. Multi-sensor fusion using a built-in Inertial Navigation Subsystem (INS) and the Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) is used to detect physical motion allowing detecting and mitigation of spoofing and multipath signals and the reduction of clock errors. The built-in INS also allows detecting if the unit is operating in a stationary position mode, which the proposed algorithm can then use to discipline the internal CSAC with as little as a single satellite in view, allowing operation under foliage and in urban canyons. A 3-cornered-hat approach is used in the proposed algorithm to detect and remove errors and abnormalities on any one of the three input signals (GPS, INS, CSAC)."

        "abstract": "Army mission planning is complex and entails coordination across echelons in a dynamic environment. There is a significant opportunity to mitigate the complexity with new decision aiding systems. Chief among the challenges is designing a decision aiding system that appropriately represents the many planning artifacts, both digital and analog, as well as updating and integrating the dynamic entities and relationships needed for revising plans and courses of action in real-time. Future systems must satisfactorily represent the relationships between high level, abstract plans and low-level, detailed plans and provide system users an optimized view of the most relevant information for the task at hand while hiding at-the-moment irrelevant information. This requires comprehensive formal representations with defined semantics that spans the MDMP. Our approach will evaluate formalism to represent the mission planning concepts, algorithms to manipulate those concepts, and near-term aspects of the mission planning process. The ultimate goal of the system is to leverage a natural division of labor between human and machine to provide enough automation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of mission planning while promoting a shared understanding of the planning so that human planners trust the system."

This regrouping of the team can be difficult, as team members and equipment can land dispersed over wide areas, local terrain and vegetation can limit visibility, and paratroopers may not observe the relative landing location of others. Paratrooper Location And Tracking Operations (PLATO) is conceived to provide accurate and precise location data for paratroopers and air-dropped supplies, through descent, landing, and providing navigation post-landing as they regroup.

        "abstract": "This proposal is to develop a novel plasma coating technologies and diamond-like carbon (DLCs) coating materials for producing non-toxic hydrophobic coatings to improve the infrared obscurant performance of metal flakes and red phosphorous (RP) powder for which the coating does not impede the RP burning. DLC coatings are highly hydrophobic, chemically inert, transparent in the IR range, and bio-compatible, and they are amorphous carbon materials containing high sp3 carbon. NCD Technologies will innovate new plasma coating systems to coat the metal flakes and RP with DLC uniformly. Specific DLC materials will be explored to coat the nano-scale metal flakes, rods and RP powders, to reduce agglomeration and oxidation while maintaining infrared obscurant performance. The delamination of DLC coatings on RF are also thermal controllable to allow the DLC coatings to peel off before the RPs burning point, so that the coating does not impact burn rates or yield. This work will result in the supply of DLC coated metal flakes and RP to the ARMY for further evaluation leading to future adoption."

Nano Terra proposes to formulate non-toxic, hygroscopic materials into smoke formulations that will produce smoke having high mass extinction coefficients. These formulations will produce aerosols with well-defined yield factors, leading to highly efficient smoke generation, all without the use of pyrophoric materials. These visible obscurant formulations can be tuned through the choice of small molecules, oligomers, and encapsulated polymers to achieve the desired control of the growth factor, the viscosity, surface tension, and vapor pressure, all of which will determine the aerosol size, and thereby the efficacy of this material for creating the visible obscurant."

With high-rate calibrated impact stimulation and all-optical sensing, SafeLanding collects high-quality deflectometry data while the unit is in motion. Unlike rolling wheel deflectometers, SafeLanding does not rely on heavy weights to produce a measurable deflection basin. Rather, the complete unit can be towed by an ordinary pickup truck or SUV. Measurements are recorded automatically as the unit is towed, without operator intervention. Immediate analysis tells the operator the system measurement state, eliminating failed data runs. All data are collected with GPS date and location stamps to ensure unambiguous results. With each pass, SafeLanding records data on 100 points across the line of travel to a total width up to 1.7 meters, and at a density of one sample row every 0.7 meters along the line of travel. Higher density data acquisition is supported by towing more slowly."

Pavement Performance data can identify how well the current infrastructure on the host nation runways and roadways can serve the Military operations prior to a catastrophic event. There are five main pavement performance related data subsets which can highlight current pavement network condition: (1) roughness data; (2) surface distress data; (3) surface friction data; (4) deflection data; and (5) Ground Penetrating Radar. The two priorities in this list for the Army are deflection data and ground penetrating radar. Deflection data is important to assess the pavements current load acceptance and areas that require improvement in order to allow for large numbers of heavy vehicles, cargo, and aircraft. Ground Penetrating Radar data is important to assess the sub-surface structures that are present and which structures require improvement to prevent catastrophic punch through during use. Deflection data will be most useful if collected real-time at highway speeds with no lane closures, no additional congestion, no traffic backups, reduced work zone safety issues, using readily available heavy equipment on site via a RWD with 3D GPR."

Current and future operational theaters present a constantly-expanding set of potential threats that pose a hazard to operations, to include various types of chemical warfare agents and chemistries, biological materials, and energetic\/explosive compounds.The U.S. Army has taken the lead towards stimulating the development of an innovative integration of multiple threat detection indicators (chemical warfare agents, biologicals, arsenicals, alkylating agents, energetic, and explosives) into a single-chit form factor. Additionally, it is expected that field operators can further benefit from such a multi-threat detecting indicator if it: i) requires minimal amount of test sample (a drop of liquid or a few grains of powder); ii) rapidly delivers an observable color change that can be compared to a reference bar or chart; iii) exhibits prolonged stability and long shelf-life when stored under a variety of extreme conditions (temperature and humidity), and; iv) is low-cost and relies on robust chemistries and established manufacturing methods and technologies for future large-scale production.As such, in response to this U.S. Army need, Lynntech proposes the development of a highly selective, sensitive, rapid-response, and multi-threat detecting paper-based indicator as part of this Phase I effort."

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for biometric authentication and access management for medics and casualty identification on Android platforms, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Android Biometric Authentication and Casualty Identification (ABACI) tool integrating a modular Android software toolset capable of dynamically utilizing one or more sensors for medic authentication and patient identification management and providing role-based access to protected medical data. The novel integration enables ABACI to dynamically select an authentication mechanism and provide role-based data access. Specifically, the innovation in the unique design of the add-on sensor module and algorithms to dynamically select the optimal sensor enables the ABACI module to facilitate rapid, robust user authentications in combat situations. As a result, ABACI offers the capability for the medic to log into the Android device and medical applications for rapid, secure, role-based data access. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of ABACI by using a commercial Android device with on-board biometric sensors and a software module for user provisioning, authentication, and role-based data access. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a ruggedized prototype based on an Army Nett Warrior Android device, providing role-based authenticated access to eTCCC and other medical applications."

ATCorp is proposing BeAN, a solution to use biometric ECG information to authenticate with Androids. BeAN would provide seamless integration to the Medic by requiring no active identification, only for the Nett Warrior user to wear a bracelet that measures the users ECG (Electrocardiogram).ECGs have been shown to have a correct, unique, identification rate of 96%.In addition to authenticating the Medic, ATCorp is proposing a similar ECG identification, or a small Bluetooth Low Emission beacon to identify casualties in the field.ATCorps proposed solution using a COTS ECG monitoring band, and a defined API, provides a simplified solution to authentication and role access to Nett Warrior applications."

Unmanned air and ground vehicles (UAV\/UGV) provide a solution to enable quick casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) leveraging multi-purpose vehicles such as cargo transport. However, unmanned systems were typically not designed for human transport and may potentially create physiological stresses that exceed that of current evacuation platforms. It is necessary to have a better understanding of the effects of flight on injuries such as head trauma, chest and lung trauma, abdominal bleeding, and long bone fracture to guide flight parameters on future UAV\/UGV CASEVAC missions. CRG proposes to develop movement and maneuver constraints to safely evacuate the patient.CRG will perform an extensive literature survey and will identify the gaps in existing research and execute additional testing (within scope of budget) to address these gaps.This information will then be translated into flight control modifications based on injury. Algorithms will be developed taking into consideration injury specifics, prioritizing appropriately for operational realties such as threat evasion. CRG has assembled a multi-disciplinary team, comprised of biomedical engineers, flight physicians, statisticians, algorithm developers, and flight controls experts to provide and transition a solution to the field."

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for a low profile strain measurement system for parachute suspension lines, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Smart Parachute Suspension Line (SPASL). It is based on novel construction of suspension and control cords using core-conducting bi-component fiber yarns in a double braid rope configuration. Specifically, the innovation in utilizing low and high conductivity synthetic fiber yarns in core and cover braids will enable the SPASL to monitor strain on the cord while maintaining electronic link along the suspension line. As a result, this proposed technology offers independent strain monitoring on individual suspension and control lines of the parachute and power and data link between the payload and canopy, which directly address the Army requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of SPASL by performing analytical calculations and simulations and conducting laboratory experiments using a benchtop prototype. In Phase II, a full scale SPASL prototype will be built based on the Phase I results and findings. At the end of Phase II, the SPASL technology is expected to reach technology readiness level (TRL)-4 to -5 and be ready for airdrop testing in a relevant environment."

This proposal provides a solution for prioritizing and maximizing the reuse of graphical avionics systems by detailing an innovative software development process and reference architecture that utilizes emerging standards like FACE and ARINC 661 and model-based systems engineering to create portable and configurable software applications that can be deployed for simulation, testing, training, ground station, or airborne purposes. This reduces development and integration time and cost, promotes cross-vendor and cross-platform reuse, and lowers the overall software costs for military programs."

This is accomplished by removing the standard, parallel, memory bus architecture and replacing it with a chainable, high speed serial, multi-ported interface. A single RHyTHM module will comprise up to 256 flash die connected to the ISIA controller as a wide-word interface capable of supporting very high data transfer bandwidth. By incorporating COTS components, RHyTHM is able to provide an easily sustainable, low-cost, migrate-able, production platform capable of leveraging the latest and greatest in flash devices to maintain the highest possible density and the minimum size and weight all while retaining a standardized and backwards compatible, flexible interface allowing for drop-in upgradeability and system design."

We will start with a baseline service-oriented architecture (SOA) that incorporates the US Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiatives Total Learning Architecture (TLA), the standard model of ITS, and existing reference architectures such as the Live Synthetic Training and Test &amp; Evaluation Infrastructure Architecture (LS TTE IA). We will derive a comprehensive set of requirements from an environmental scan and from targeted use cases, and will modify the baseline architecture to meet these requirements, including requirements for team as well as individual training.The resulting reference architecture will guide the design, development, acquisition, evaluation, and governance of ITS offered as services in SOA training environments. Particular attention will be paid to pedagogical services and to collecting learner and other data required to evaluate training effectiveness and to manage SOA training environments within larger enterprise architectures. A proposed Phase I Option will prepare for the development of reference implementations in a Phase II project."

The system is based on innovative use of electro-optical crystals for high-speed nonmechanical beam steering combined with a 1550 nm laser which is invisible to night vision googles, thus providing real-time beam configuration for improved autonomous capabilities. The innovations along with the novel optical design enable a wide field of view greater than 120 degrees in horizontal field and greater than 10 degrees in vertical field. Unique laser configuration provides a range of 100 meters and a range accuracy better than 2 cm. In Phase I, POC plans to design a proof of concept prototype for an affordable, compact RASS sensor that meets the Army specifications and can redirect its laser beam in real time to specific points of interest designated by a user or autonomous software system. In Phase II, POC will refine the design and build RASS for testing in a relevant laboratory environment or on a military ground vehicle system. At the end of Phase II, POC will deliver at least three units for government feasibility and integration testing."

Measurements made on constituent materials will be used as reference data sets to distinguish between materials of the same and\/or different material classes.Material matching algorithms will be developed for comparing measured data to reference data sets.The same set of spectral optical properties will be measured for each layer in multilayer transparent armor layups simultaneously and compared to reference data sets to determine the matching material composition, as well as physical thickness of each layer.During Phase I Option, Lumetrics proposes to investigate temperature effects on the accuracy of material recognition.This information will be used to modify the detection algorithms to improve accuracy. In addition, we will begin designing a transportable version of the instrument, which will include a handheld probe interface , for testing the detection capabilities of the proposed approach on-site."

        "abstract": "The US Army is seeking a high-resolution, rail-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging system capable of operating within the 100300GHz frequency range.Wide bandwidth SAR technologies at this frequency range provide the potential for supporting applications that require high-resolution, non-destructive imaging.In response to this opportunity, MaXentric is proposing an EHF rail-based SAR system codenamed M-CRISP (Multi-Channel Rail-based Radar Imaging Sensor Platform).To design and develop this system, MaXentric has teamed with the mmw\/Sub-THz IC group at NCSU and radar expert Dr. Aly Fathy of UTK.The proposed architecture moves a set of EHF transceivers along a linear track to provide cross-range imaging.The transceiver measurements are combined to further improve range resolution to approach 1mm resolution. The Phase I effort will focus on investigating the EHF radar imaging tradespace to create a detailed blueprint for a Phase II prototype system.During the Phase I effort, our team will reduce risk associated with future hardware prototyping by constructing a sub-THz rail-based SAR development platform. This system will be used to verify the Phase I simulations and provide a EHF imaging demonstration during Phase I."

While signal strength, and consequently signal to noise ratios (SNR) and signal to clutter ratios (SCR) remain the primary limitation, constantly increasing power levels in these bands result in the accessibility of a greater diversity of applications. Of these applications, RF and radar imaging techniques have some of the highest potential of rapid integration in a number of fields through the intuitive nature of false color imagery. In support of nondestructive testing IERUS will implement an end-to-end system simulation in support of a model based systems engineering approach to design of an EHF rail SAR prototype system."

        "abstract": "Missile base flow prediction is an area that has eluded a satisfactory solution since the 1950&apos;s owing to the complex aero-thermo-chemical physics of this region involving flow separation, two-phase gas\/particle non-equilibrium, chemical kinetics, and flow turbulence in complex geometries. Additional complexities are introduced when considering alterations to the base flow structure and plume turbulence (which can affect missile drag and heating, as well as the plume thermal signature and afterburning) that result from the particulate in solid-propellant missile exhaust. Consequently, it is important to include particle effects in computational simulations to accurately predict missile performance and the missile\/plume signature for detection\/avoidance concerns. The overall objective of the proposed program is to extend and validate the CFD simulation capability for missile base flows, accounting for particle loading effects relevant to Solid Propellant Missiles towards providing the government with a comprehensive CFD capability to predict these complex flowfields. The Phase I program will initiate progress towards this overall goal using a collaborative research effort consisting of a computational phase to investigate turbulence characteristics of high-speed flows with moderate to heavy particle loading, and proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating a validated ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy system for collecting relevant data for validation of the computational model."

        "abstract": "Small arms round counting, strike detection, projectile trajectory mapping, infrared and visible muzzle flash sensing, and projectile velocity spectrum (subsonic to supersonic) analysis requires a highly accurate sensor capable of locating within one half caliber in strike location detection, and without missed event in iteration counting. We propose our ultra-fast Photon-Sensing Integrated Circuit (PSIC) small arms projectile imager to meet such stringent needs. In order to discern a 1-cm-sized caliber in the trajectory of a projectile moving at the high speed of, say, 2000 m\/s, the optical imager will need to support an integration time of 5 micro-seconds or faster. The ultra-fast Photon-Sensing Integrated Circuit (PSIC) small arms projectile imager is proposed to meet the above-mentioned challenge, delivering high speed, low data rate, and low cost in manufacturing quantities.We propose to iteratively design, optimize, fabricate and characterize the PSIC FPA to high speed, and integrate and deliver the PSIC imager to DoD.During Phase III, we will fabricate several technology demonstrator units, deliver to DoD, and continue collaborating with well-established aerospace and defense companies to serve DoD programs of record. Simultaneously, we will pursue commercialization into the civilian commercial market."

Low-cost yet very high speed fiber-optic telecommunications technology captures the pulse stream and allows HIPAT to characterize large transient pressure (millions of psi) and also maintain fine pressure resolution on the order of 100 psi and lower. This very wide dynamic range supports detailed measurement of violent events such as explosions, kinetic-kill processes and gun-barrel pressure and temperature dynamics. HIPAT sensor technology interfaces through a non-electrical fiber-optic link and is therefore immune to electromagnetic pulse and electromagnetic interference. The fiber-optic link supports remote sensing more than 1 km away from the events under test. The sensor itself, as well as the optical fiber, can tolerate 10&apos;s of G acceleration and shock."

NanoSonic has demonstrated the feasibility of NM transducer materials in such sensors for the measurement of dynamic normal pressure using the shock tube facility.

Moreover, the small size, low cost and user friendly features of 3IN1 would enable seamless integration into the existing sample processing workflow currently utilized for diagnosis.The proposed Phase I effort will focus on providing strong proof-of-concept for the 3IN1 approach.Future phases will focus on demonstration of clinical utility of 3IN1 to significantly aid in definitive and early diagnosis of the causative of febrile illness of infectious origin, obtaining FDA regulatory clearance and commercialization of 3IN1.The availability of 3IN1 could have a significant and positive impact at all levels of military medical care by enabling more reliable diagnosis and thereby guiding definitive treatment resulting in faster return to duty."

Patient samples frequently require cold storage during transport to a centralized diagnostic laboratory. During transport antigens and antibodies may be degraded by proteases present in specimen sample matrices and lead to a false-negative diagnosis of the patient. Point of care diagnostics are emerging as an easy and rapid diagnostic tool but these assays lack the sensitivity of sophisticated laboratory equipment. In Phase I we will develop Sample CAP, a sample concentration and preservation device that requires no power input and will stabilize urine and serum samples at room temperature for at least 2 weeks. Samples will be rapidly concentrated by forward osmosis driven by hydrogel draw to increase assay sensitivity and preserved by addition of a specially formulated stabilizing additive compatible with serological assays. Once a sample is loaded into Sample CAP no user intervention is required until serological analysis of biomolecules. In Phase II we will use the feedback from Department of Defense testing to improve Sample CAP performance to meet sensitivity and specificity requirements set forth by the DoD. We will also conduct stability testing"

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for an algorithm for enhanced detection and classification of stationary ground targets for fire control radar (FCR) mounted on Apache attack helicopters, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Deep Learning Stationary Target Detector and Classifier (DEESTAC) technology. DEESTAC is based on a customization of recent advancements in deep-learning methods for classifying objects in images. Specifically, the innovation in deep-learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance radar resolution and detect stationary targets with complex radar signatures will enable DEESTAC-based radar systems to reliably detect and classify targets in data with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Thus, this technology offers improved battlefield awareness for an appropriate warfighter response in life threatening situations, which directly addresses the Army need. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of DEESTAC by developing a technology readiness level (TRL)-3 prototype. We will investigate the feasibility of DEESTAC by developing its algorithms and testing them on radar data. In Phase II, POC plans to build and deliver a TRL-6 prototype, implemented and tested with extensive radar data representing a variety of target scenarios."

        "abstract": "Unsecured areas contain multiple threats. These threats include unknown radio frequency (RF) transmissions that could exist anywhere in the 2 MHz to 6 GHz frequency range. To assist in securing the area, there is a desire to detect, identify, locate, and potentially disrupt these RF transmissions. Due to the physical threats in the environment, a solution that can provide intelligence of the RF transmissions via one or more unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) is desired. In this environment there will be multiple signals to process, each with different RF characteristics. The UGV may have line-of-sight access to a transmitter, or the UGV may receive the RF transmission after it has taken multiple different paths.Toyon proposes to use our multiple input\/multiple output embedded software defined radio product to implement an automatic RF scanning system covering the frequency range of 1 MHz to 6 GHz. This system will also be configured to identify the type of RF transmission it detects. Direction finding (DF) algorithms and antenna designs will be studied along with methods for Electronic Attack directed toward the detected transmission. A prototype system design will be developed during the Phase I effort, and fabricated and demonstrated during the Phase II program."

        "abstract": "Human vision provides a sensory system limited to roughly a 120-degree field of view (FOV); however, warfighters must operate in a 360-degree world. Thus, any potential threat or opportunity outside the normal forward-facing FOV is not immediately visible by the warfighter. Providing a 360-degree FOV of their surroundings would dramatically enhance situation awareness, however, there is a need to first identify methods to enable and then validate that warfighters can in fact acclimate to such an augmented FOV. To address this need, Charles River Analytics proposes to design, prototype, and conduct initial validation of a system for Rapid Acclimation to Vision Augmentation to Greatly Enhance Visual Range (RAVAGER). RAVAGER supports initial, empirical exploration and validation of mechanisms to facilitate acclimation into and out of an augmented FOV. It uses gaze tracking to apply augmentations while ensuring no distortion is present that would inhibit focal vision. Under the proposed Phase I effort, we will demonstrate that it is feasible for individuals to acclimate, both perceptually and cognitively, to this type of augmented FOV, setting the stage for a Phase II effort focused on empirical validation and extensions to provide additional FOV enhancements (e.g., overlaid HUD symbologies) to promote the enhanced SA."

        "abstract": "Army aviators are flying helicopters in highly dynamic and dangerous scenarios. In urban warfare, this can mean avoiding obstacles and external threats. On platforms like the US Army CH-47 Chinook, the pilot has guidance from a flight engineer or crew chief who can look down through a hatch in the floor. Other Army helicopters do not have that luxury. Regardless, there are numerous blind spots remaining around the aircraft that leave it vulnerable. SA Photonics has developed innovative methods of mapping a 360 FOV into a 120 FOV with our immersive High Situational Awareness and FOV system (HiSAF) system in order to support warfighter situational awareness and decisive actions. The central 1:1 region will allow a natural viewing environment while providing peripheral vision over the remaining 360 FOV, outside of the central region. The SA Photonics HiSAF system can be configured real-time in both an augmented reality (AR) optically see-through configuration, as well as direct view virtual reality (VR) version. Multiple mapping solutions with adjustable options will be developed, as well as acclimation and re-acclimation protocols. Mapping methods and options will be tested to determine the best fit for human performance."

This work takes the proven autonomous capability from MACS-B and extends the high-level distributed coordination capability. Priorities include capturing user intent at a high level and transforming that intent into lower-level commands, visualizing these lower-level commands in an intuitive way, and simplifying simultaneous command of different types of robots. In order to realize a future where an operator can leverage multiple robotic platforms simultaneously with minimal attention, a new control architecture must be considered. Key factors include increasing autonomy of each robot so that a user does not need to monitor each platform constantly, thereby improving human\/machine interfaces, and allowing the simultaneous control of multiple robots from a single control station by a single warfighter. The proposed effort addresses all three of these architectural enhancements. Robotic Research will augment the work performed on the MACS-B project with an architecture enhancement and capability that reduces an operators workload on a per-robot basis, progresses the operators interface to control each robot at a higher and more intuitive level, all while maintaining the capability to concurrently control multiple robots at the same time."

The outcome of such a growth is streamlined production process for the detectors. In phase II Field Viewers will use the R&amp;D in phase I to build a production plant to produce as-grown detector grade materials. Field Viewers will then commercialize the detector grade materials in various industries, including security and medical imaging. The commercialization path explored will be two folds. .Our current product offerings, FAQIR2017 and FALKON launched in NSS-MIC2017, Atlanta, are based on CdTe and Si detectors. These two products are radiation survey meter using a remote controlled drone and hand held radiation detector tablet respectively. These two products were launched based on the phase I SBIR work done in 2017 for Department of Energy. In addition, Field Viewers has few other products in pipeline which will use this revolutionary detector material, CZTS."

(PSI) will develop a Dynamic Decoupling Fixture (DDF) that maintains the M1A2 Abrams Tanks Gunner Primary Sight (GPS) boresighting accuracy during normal vehicle operations and then decouples to reduce accelerations during ballistic impacts. The DDF consists of a sub-micron accuracy kinematic coupling paired with a detent system that keeps the GPS boresighted during normal vehicle operations. During a ballistic impact the GPS de-couples from the kinematic fixture briefly, allowing a spring-damper assembly to dissipate the impact energy which would otherwise damage carefully calibrated optics. After it absorbs the energy, the fixture returns to its pre-impact state with micro-radian accuracy, allowing rapid return to firing readiness.During the Phase 1 program, PSI will design a spring-damper system that attenuates the loading from ballistic impacts to below 200g over 0.5ms half-sine. The GPS will be located in all six degrees-of-freedom with a highly-repeatable kinematic mount that provides main gun boresighting retention within 50 microradians.During the Phase II program PSI will manufacture the isolator designed in Phase I and subject two prototypes to in-house impact testing. Once those test results have been incorporated, the isolator will be installed into an Abrams turret and subjected to a live-fire test."

        "abstract": "For ballistic shock isolation of the M1A2 Abrams Gunner Primary Sight (GPS), the LoadPath Abrams Shock Stack (LASS) is an innovative shock attenuation system capable of isolating critical components within the GPS from damage while maintaining boresight alignment during operational environments. Due to the high level of shock attenuation required, the LASS utilizes a multi-faceted approach to shock reduction that includes a classic shock isolator design enhanced with supplemental attenuation mechanisms. LASS features multiple shock attenuation mechanisms in series and parallel including an optimized isolation fundamental frequency, a convoluted load path between source and output, integral constrained-layer damping, and stacked interfaces to achieve order-of-magnitude reduction in transmitted shock. LASS has the potential to substantially increase the Abrams GPS resiliency and battlefield performance. In the Phase I effort, a high-performance shock attenuation system will be developed by applying the following innovations:1. Multiple shock attenuation strategies applied in concert2. Optimized, high-loss passive damping treatment3. Advanced Finite Element Analysis methods4. Modular design and optimized packaging"

        "abstract": "Todays Army routinely supports joint interagency, intergovernmental, multinational missions where critical information is often written in foreign languages. To address this issue, the U.S. Army has developed the Machine Foreign Language Translation System (MFLTS) that aims to provide accurate and rapid translation of foreign languages to English. Nonetheless, the performance of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in MFLTS is often limited by degraded or noisy documents encountered in the operational environment. Labor-intensive manual pre-processing of the document images is often required in the current operational environment, which motivates us to develop automated document image pre-processing software to improve the OCR process without depending on the skill level of human operators and to increase the overall efficiency of the MFLTS task by reducing human operators workload.Leveraging on our prior development in handwritten document recognition and computer-vision-based airport surveillance system, machine-learning-based pre-processing technologies will be developed to address the degradation in OCR accuracy in operational environments. A feasibility demonstration of the proposed document pre-processing software will be provided by the end of the Phase I."

A trade study will be performed between 802.11n (MIMO) and LTE to determine which waveform will meet performance specification in a high EMI environment. The proposed solution is a low risk approach leveraging mature open standards waveforms; available commercial hardware; Open-Source Software elements; rechargeable battery backs and an optional Type 1 Encryption module. This approach will keep Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) development costs low by simply integrating and ruggedizing commercially available low Size Weight and Power (SWaP) single board computer, rechargeable battery back and optional NSA Type 1 Encryption Module. To keep production cost low the proposed approach utilizes Open-Source Software (OSS) elements and low-cost Wi-Fi or LTE Hardware. In addition to keeping the development and production costs low use of Open-Source Software (OSS) and Open Standards waveforms eliminates proprietary designs and keeps the solution open for multiple sources with the possibility of multi-vendor interoperability within the same Intercom system. SCIS has a proven track record of leveraging open standards with Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) hardware to develop Type 1 Encrypted communication for the Army."

Wideband microwave waveforms in the 2.4 GHz regime will be targeted due to their advantages for communications in harsh environments.The deficit in device level specifications at the transmitter (i.e., peak and average power levels) and receiver (i.e., receiver sensitivity, dynamic range, SNR, and link capacity) will be overcome using multiple wideband pulses in conjunction with MIMO antennas and multi-frequency multi-pulse transmitted-reference schemes, all implementable in the software defined radio (SDR) domain.The use of SDR techniques will be further used to implement advanced signal processing techniques for channel equalization, interference mitigation, and for meeting the required processing gain. The SDR implementation provides flexibility for changing critical communications parameters to adapt to the environment for optimal performance."

        "abstract": "In preparation for the challenges of modern combat scenarios, the US Army is seeking a next-generation Human Type Target (HTT) product line to enhance training capabilities and include more realistic portrayals of threat scenarios. One area of particular interest is full body motion and collapse of the HTT when hit by a bullet. At the same time, this new system will need to withstand the live-fire environment over several thousand shots, be useable outside or inside in tight areas, and be able to be reset remotely. ADA Technologies proposes to develop a realistic, articulated, durable, and configurable HTT to support complex simulations designed to better train Army soldiers. The proposed REACT (Realistic Engagement Advanced Combat Training) System will deliver the fundamental architecture in the form of a modular product line to address multiple high quality combat training scenarios while maintaining affordability. For this program, ADA has enrolled an experienced military shooting instructor, Clinton Hoover of Black Skull Tactical Applications, and Meggitt Training Systems, a leading supplier of military targets, to successfully bring the future REACT System to market. Phase I will be a proof-of-concept step where preliminary designs of bulletproof, motorized joints and target resetting system will be created."

The RIHT Target follows a product line approach leveraging a series of systems that combine to provide a more realistic target experience for live-fire training environments. Specifically, PME will architect the flexibility of form factor and the technology content options from the beginning of the design and development program. This will allow the foundational live-fire target to be configured in multiple ways to accommodate varying specialized needs. For each potential application, the RIHT Target includes additional technology features based on the intent of the specific training exercise. Some technology considerations include: use of flexible contact-based hit zones; use of fixed contact-based hit zones; use of non-contact hit detection; shot engagement limited to 45 degrees; shot engagement at full 360 degrees; dynamic movement including mid-torso bending; static posable positioning; and full size collapsing motion. At the highest level of planned complexity, a RIHT Target will be able to move its arms so that it can either brandish a weapon to show aggression or raise its hands to signify non-combatant status or surrender.The list of potential variations to accommodate specific needs goes on and on."

(Safe) is proposing an alternate design that places the straps and anchors where the harness can develop restraining loads immediately upon the start of crash loading.The design is also more intuitive, simpler, and easier to use.It meets all requirements including minimal weight gain and no connection to aircraft power.It can be retrofit into existing seats, including the UH-60 Black Hawk seat which is selected as the technology demonstrator.The project proves feasibility directly through crash testing in the Base effort.Safe has support from a leading restraint manufacturer that will foster commercialization.Safes project team includes engineers with prior experience developing restraint systems and products for crash injury mitigation, as well as the author of the Armys &quot;Crash Survival Design Guide.&quot;The technology, project team, and commercialization plan will support technical innovation that commercializes through sales to the fleet."

        "abstract": "Seated aircrew members rely on their five-point harnesses to position their bodies correctly within their seats in order to provide the best chance of survivability during a rapid deceleration event. The current system requires the user to adjust each of five straps manually in order to correctly position the central rotary buckle in such a way to minimize potential internal injuries. For a variety of reasons, these straps are not always adjusted properly. When excess length is present, the harness can no longer effectively limit the users motion or displacement during a crash. Of special interest in this SBIR topic is the phenomenon of pitchout, in which a users head and shoulder pivot forward away from his\/her seatback, or in which the users head and shoulders exit the harness completely. Pitchout can lead to significant injuries and even death. In order to improve the crashworthiness of the current harness, GS Engineering proposes a comprehensive approach to development of a high performance self-adjusting harness, which will eliminate the manual adjustment protocol and in turn greatly reduce injuries caused by pitch-out. GS Engineering will work with its strategic team members to deliver a crash-worthy harness with high commercialization prospect."

MFSR has not previously been applied for near real-time video data enhancement and requires innovation to achieve the necessary image processing quality and speed. OKSI will develop and demonstrate the MFSR solution on surrogate video during Phase-I. During Phase-II, OKSI will produce a standalone system to implement the MFSR solution with low latency on high frame rate video."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for a ruggedized rotorcraft-capable optical backbone network, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISS) proposes to develop a new Mission-Capable Scalable Open Architecture Photonics (McSOAP) system. McSOAP is based on the innovative adaption of DoD HOST\/SOSA standards combined with a new redundant optical dual star-network configuration with photonic component integration strategies for mission-capable ruggedization. Specifically, the innovation in dual-redundant star network, pigtail-less rugged transceivers, and use of VITA 66 fiber interface allow McSOAP to maintain consistent use of open standards. Hence, this technology offers secure dual redundancy, modified HOST compatibility, SWaP-C optimization, low latency, and scalability, which directly address the Armys requirements. In Phase I, ISS plans to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Specifically, we will develop the architecture for modeling, simulation, and proof-of-concept demonstration, as well as develop, specify, and acquire components necessary to evaluate performance under operational rotorcraft conditions to determine a development strategy for Phase II. In Phase II, ISS will design McSOAP in greater detail, verify the capabilities of its architecture; fabricate, test, and validate a prototype system based on the Phase I results; assess the production readiness and supply chain reliability; and update a transition plan for beyond Phase II."

The Data Refinery for Aviation Sustainment (DRAS) applies methods and techniques from statistics, data science, and data management to refine the source data prior to its integration into algorithms and models. DRAS characterizes the causes and types of noise in the source data, and then applies the appropriate methods to effectively filter this noise from the data while maintaining the integrity of the data itself. Noise in the CBM source data can be caused by factors ranging from erroneous sensor data to simple data entry or transcription errors.

These efficient software techniques and methodologies will address both the scatterer model development\/update as well as the scene generation software updates necessary to apply dynamic and efficient near-field corrections so to provide realistic signatures to sensors under test."

        "abstract": "The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop and validate the ability of novel polymeric materials to detect, sequester, and degrade explosives, most notably RDX and PETN, from contaminated environments, especially impacted water and soil. RDX has spread to soil and waterways in locations where it is manufactured and munitions are used, including adjacent to more than sixty military installations in the United States. RDX and PETN have low vapor pressure, and our collaborators have previously developed polymers capable of detecting these compounds in trace quantities. Separately, CycloPure has developed porous polymers capable of sequestering organic contaminants which may be modified for selectivity using molecular design strategies. In Phase I, we will validate the ability of these materials to detect and concentrate explosive compounds in pure water and simulated groundwater. Structural modifications to the adsorbent to maximize its affinity for RDX will be explored. Multifunctional materials capable of detection and sequestration are proposed by polymerizing one material in the presence of another, which will provide further amplification of RDX detection. In Phase II, successful polymer\/conjugated polymer hybrids will be modified to include explosives degradation processes to target materials capable of continuous detection and safe removal."

        "abstract": "Chemical components of explosives compounds have contaminated environments and water to extreme levels.Chemicals such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) pose a risk to the health of humans, livestock, wildlife and ecosystems. Both TNT and RDX have been shown to cause adverse health effects in mammals such as: anemia, nausea, convulsions, and ultimately death. Recently, TNT and RDX were classified as potential human carcinogens and were restricted to a 2.0 g\/L health advisory limit. Covalent Organic Framework (COFs) provide a chemically robust and tunable platform for detection, sequestration, and remediation of explosive compounds. We propose to design a biomimetic catalytic COF platform inspired from an Fe(III)-based cytochrome P450 enzyme, where 2D geometry, 3D geometry, and metal center loading be varied. We will determine how each characteristic affects the detection, sequestration, and remediation of TNT and RDX in synthetic wastewater. Mechanochemical synthesis will be used and optimized to scale COF synthesis and produce a COF material at 10x the current reported level of fabrication. The proposed research will result in the down selection of a specific COF design and demonstration of a scalable fabrication approach for further exploration and commercialization efforts."

PSS will also demonstrate that the GPEG.MIL VE data stream will significantly improve the performance of 3D map-matching algorithms, enabling more rapid and precise (sub-meter) localization when matching to LiDAR data from low altitude unmanned aerial systems.This innovative approach eliminates a large amount of irrelevant, occluded data from the delivery stream as well as the downstream processing pipelines. The GPEG.MIL VE data stream will allow virtually instant, on-demand access to the relevant 3D geospatial data required for analysis, mission planning and precision GPS-denied navigation.For tactical visualization, the GPEG.MIL VE protocol will deliver virtually instant remote access to massive 3D geospatial data and support enhanced client-side rendering performance.For GPS-denied navigation, the GPEG.MIL data stream will deliver the data needed to enable more performant 3D map-matching algorithms supporting agile, intelligent autonomous operations deep into GPS-denied areas."

Navigation within such denied environments carries with it the potential for large communication and computation overheads. More specifically, the sUAS platforms may need to download full or partial 3D maps over the communication network in real-time, and then utilize these maps for navigation via coregistering real-time sensor data with the pre-existing 3D georeferenced maps downloaded over the network. The key challenge is finding a data structure for storing, streaming, and processing 3D data sets that successfully reduces the burden on the communication network, while still enabling the data to be processed in real-time on-board the sUAS platform. OKSI proposes leveraging Octree data structures which frequently provide around 99.8% data compression in comparison to standard 3D voxel grids."

The high energy density bio-char can be stored and then converted to electricity using a direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell developed by Nexceris LLC. PSIs preliminary analysis and modeling have indicated that high energy density bio-char can be produced with high process energy efficiency. Additionally, batches of biomass containing moderate amounts of water can be pyrolyzed in this reactor at biomass feed rate of over 1kg\/hr within the 30 L volume. During Phase I work, these estimations, which were established from theoretical calculations based on pyrolysis literature data, will be confirmed through experimentation and serve as a basis for prototype design and development in Phase II. Phase II will demonstrate the successful upgrading of biomass to bio-char in the self-sustaining pyrolysis reactor."

Best-in-class isolation (&gt;80dB), bandwidth (&gt;500 MHz), and nearby jammer suppression (20dB) have already been demonstrated by the proposing team. This game-changing capability leverages highly orthogonal wideband multi-feed antennas and analog self-interference filtering techniques, developed over the past 3 years as the subject of $1.4M+ of research funding. The proposed solution utilizes passive, analog design, lending itself to maximum linearity, with a high level of integration and miniaturization, as well as platform-agnostic implementation. The Phase I effort will include comparative analysis of SF-STAR approaches, and system simulation to establish operating margins and implementation feasibility of the selected architecture."

        "abstract": "To reduce size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-c), military platforms have been evolving towards more integrated platforms that utilize all available space. For radiating systems, this will require exploring innovative design methods, materials and manufacturing approaches to realize cost-effective, customizable and conformal antennas. An attractive solution to this challenge is offered by additive manufacturing (AM). Recently commercial multi-material AM systems have been developed allowing users to print a wide range of commercial or custom materials without moving the part. This opens up the possibility of fabricating complete antenna systems using a single AM printer. However, a lack of suitable materials is hindering the applicability of this technology towards real-world applications. The objectives of this proposal are to develop high dielectric constant and high conductivity materials suitable for multimaterial AM systems. To this end, DeLUX Engineering will develop custom dielectrically loaded polymer filaments capable of achieving dielectric constants as high as 15 using polymer extrusion based printing. We will also demonstrate the feasibility of synthesizing high conductivity pastes using trace amounts of organic binders. In Phase II these new materials will be used to realize a fully AM fabricated antenna structure using a single AM printer in a fully automated process."

        "abstract": "A hybrid electric vehicle architecture can use the low-weight, high-power advantage of electric motors in conjunction with the high specific energy of liquid fuel to create a VTOL aircraft capable of long missions.A transitioning vehicle is an ideal architecture for hybrid propulsion technology due to the large difference in power for hover and cruise.In this system, the battery power would augment the liquid fuel for hover and then switch to exclusively liquid fuel during cruise.Transitioning vehicles that rely on conventional liquid fuel architectures are very complex and suffer from the limited specific power of liquid fuel engines and high hover power requirements; hybrid technology can enable simple architectures for transitioning vehicles and take advantage of high specific power electric motors.Hybrid-electric transitioning vehicles could replace many of the Armys large UAVs that currently need a catapult system, or a runway for takeoff.A hybrid propulsion system is the key ingredient for these types of VTOL UAVs.In this phase I, LaunchPoint Technologies plans to develop a hybrid propulsion system in the 80 kW range for VTOL systems."

MIDAS can be air-deployed from transport vehicles and its efficient aerodynamic design enables dense spatiotemporal surveillance of areas of interest. The ability to loiter or hover allows for prolonged reconnaissance of specific targets. MIDAS operates at a high level of autonomy due to advanced flight control, vision-processing for obstacle detection, and an automated recharging process. These components result in complete autonomous operation for extended periods as MIDAS can automatically recharge itself without any supervisory intervention or guidance."

The hybrid design of IMAGRS will enable the platform to meet demanding flight characteristics and mission constraints, while still achieving dynamic maneuverability and the ability to hover. Its small and transformable platform enables the system to be pre-packaged and deployed from cylindrical containers. Attached to the platform, is a payload consisting of multi-spectral imaging, onboard processing, communications and advanced autopilot. The autopilot includes a collection of flight sensors that enable advanced autonomous behaviors such as takeoff, navigation, precision landing, obstacle avoidance, and automatic recharging. The advanced autopilot can also trigger and command the imaging sensor and gimbal to orient to regions of interest.

        "abstract": "Recent research has shown evidence for formation of carbon suboxide polymer and polymeric-carbon monoxide at near-ambient pressures in small-scale nonthermal plasma discharge reactors. Carbon suboxide polymer and polymeric-carbon monoxide are examples of novel solids obtained from simple gas molecules such as CO. The solid formation rates achieved in these studies are too low (&lt; 1 g\/h) and the existing reactor designs are unsuitable for larger scale production and collection of solid products for characterization, testing and industrial use. Lynntech has experience in design and construction of nonthermal and thermal plasma reactors and devices for novel applications for military and commercial use.Lynntech proposes to design and develop a plasma reactor that maximizes solid production rate while maintaining batch-to-batch reproducibility. The initial studies will validate the plasma process by in-situ characterization of the deposited material. This will be followed by development of a plasma reactor design for larger scale production and user-friendly operation.The plasma reactor will be designed to be tunable to achieve required deposition rate, composition, morphological characteristics, etc. A preliminary plasma reactor design with operating conditions and tunable parameters will be identified to achieve the Phase II production target."

The reactor falls within the category of a dielectric barrier discharge where a dielectric barrier covers at least one of the two parallel plate electrodes. It is a non-equilibrium reactor where electron temperature is much higher than ion temperature such that the gas temperature remains low over a wide range of operational parameters. Low temperature operation is important to successful growth of extended solids."

        "abstract": "There is an urgent need for warfighters to train for cyber warfare as it is likely to manifest in the context of their own operational environment. The complex decision making typically needed in cyber and kinetic engagements leads to a multiplication of potential responses.This complexity drives the need to develop an integrated solution for the combined cyberspace\/kinetic battlefield training and ultimately towards the need for high-fidelity, multi-factor simulated engagements, in which cyber and kinetic domains affect each other. Existing approaches to introduce cyber effects in kinetic engagements do so at a very coarse level that does not accurately reflect the dynamics with which cyber threats can degrade our weapon system operation and the accompanying command and control cycle.The goal of this effort is to develop iSCORE, a system which will simulate an intelligent, responsive cyber OPFOR, and integrate it with emulated tactical networks, and live, virtual, constructive and gaming systems into a full and instrumented synthetic cyber\/kinetic warfare training environment. We propose to develop a solution that enables the dynamic effects of compromised data privacy, integrity or availability to realistically affect operational systems, humans in the loop, or constructive entities, potentially causing changes in battlefield outcome."

Nuvotronics proposes a solution for secure, high-bandwidth data links operating at V-band frequencies with the ability to dynamically adjust multiple characteristics of the communications channel. By making adjustments to the antenna radiation patterns, the operating frequency, the transmit power and the modulation scheme, the link can be maintained while remaining covert. Nuvotronics will leverage previous and ongoing work in the millimeter-wave frequency regime including wideband antenna element design and tightly integrated packaging of high-performance MMICs and millimeter-wave integrated circuits. The packaging challenges are formidable at these frequencies due to poor geometric tolerances compared to the wavelength and lossy substrate materials; whereas, the Nuvotronics solutions do not suffer from the same challenges. We will advance our solution concept through design and selective technology demonstrations."

        "abstract": "Todays military and commercial aircraft engines are becoming more powerful and fuel efficient in order to produce better performance.For high performance military aircrafts, the engines continue to push the speed, pressure and temperature limits in order to get more thrust in a lighter more compact package.For UAV engines where turbochargers are used, it is extremely important to prevent shaft speeds from the resonant frequencies in the turbochargers. If this happens, the blades on the compressor or turbine wheel can fail, leading to the destruction of the turbocharger which then causes the UAV to crash. Therefore, there is a need to develop a turbocharger speed sensor that can reliably operate under the austere environment produced by high performance engines.SA Photonics is pleased to propose the development of a high-performance turbocharger speed sensor system for monitoring the rotation speed of the turbocharger shaft. It has the following attractive properties:- Speeds &gt; 250,000 rpm with better than 2% accuracy- Able to continuously operate to &gt; 500 hrs- Able to work athigh heat, oxidation, erosion and exhaust particle contaminant environments- One-size-fit-all ability: Same design can operate in different turbochargers sizes and shapes"

Control of the turbocharger speed is needed to avoid operation near resonant speeds and to optimize turbocharger performance and life. Currently, there are no robust flight sensors capable of measuring titanium blade turbocharger speeds at high temperatures with limited access. In the proposed program, Creare will develop a turbocharger shaft speed sensor consisting of a robust, high temperature probe head and remote electronics. The sensor will work reliably with any metallic blades and will require minimal or no modification to the turbocharger hardware. In Phase I, we will build on our existing technology to design, fabricate, and test a prototype sensor that contains the key components of the flight sensor. In Phase II, we will build, test, and deliver compact, durable shaft speed sensors that meet all the performance and integration requirements of the Army."

Furthermore, improvements are needed for low temperature operation where lithium oxyhalide batteries suffer from slow rise times after activation. Prior to the development of lithium oxyhalide reserve batteries, chemistries based on liquid ammonia as an electrolyte solvent were used. These cells demonstrated excellent low temperature performance due to the high conductivity and low viscosity of ammonia.However, previous cells using liquid ammonia possessed working voltages 3V over the entire operating temperature range (-45 to +145 F) and high discharge rates and rapid activation time at low temperatures, while meeting or exceeding the energy and power density of existing lithium oxyhalide reserve batteries."

        "abstract": "Controlled guidance of small-caliber gun-fired munitions is currently limited by the severity of inertial loads from the launch event, which can be 60,000g in small-caliber munitions. There is a need for more robust mechanical guidance-control systems in small-caliber munitions that can provide substantial control authority while being able to survive extreme launch loads.Compliant mechanisms, activated by piezoelectric actuators, can be integrated into a fin-stabilized .50 caliber bullet without the vulnerabilities of conventional actuators. Through the elimination of moving parts, pins, and joints, these piezo-actuated compliant control surfaces (PACCS) are equipped to survive high launch loads. These same characteristics also produce a zero-backlash system that can be precisely driven at very high rates to give the munitions excellent controllability. The proposed Phase I program will produce a structurally-optimized PACCS design for use in a notional .50-caliber bullet. This design could significantly augment the state of the art in guided munitions technologies and is scalable for munitions of different sizes."

For this reason, a visualization ecosystem that unifies many components from the fields of scientific visualization, infovis, data analytics, big data, and display technologies is needed. This new tool will enable interactive scientific visualization across many different 2D, 2.5D and 3D display devices. The framework must be user and data centric. This will be accomplished via meta-data categorization to automatically establish a suite of algorithms and technologies that are suitable for the data, user, and display hardware at hand. In addition, the framework must remain algorithm and display technology agnostic. This will be done via a consistent interactive meta-visualization graph used across all devices. The system will abstract out cumbersome details such as format conversion and load balancing away from users to allow them to focus on visualizing their data. The new tool will be demonstrated on the many 2D, 2.5D, and 3D display devices in the Wright State University Appenzeller Visualization Laboratory. Test cases for the proof-of-concept will include interactive visualizations capturing 3D data on immersive displays with support from infovis methods on 2D displays."

Plasma atmosphere creates a unique environment through the formation of free electrons, radicals, charged and excited species that leads to unique reactions and coatings. The atmospheric pressure, non-equilibrium plasma enhanced coating processes are generally performed at, or near, room temperature. Therefore, they are ideal for temperature sensitive substrates (such as plastics) or precursors (such as bioactive materials).Army is looking for a capability to co-deposit multiple precursors, at least one of them containing nanoparticles, using independently controlled non-equilibrium atmospheric plasma conditions. This new capability for Army material research will lead to the development of multifunctional, responsive and adaptive thin film coating systems to enhance soldier and vehicle protection.LaunchBay has developed an approach that allows:Multi-precursor deposition with controlled mixingIndependent control of plasma energy and gas atmosphereProcessing of nanoparticlesPatterning of surfaces"

The salient aspects of the proposed solution are: (1) around-the-clock learning and identification of mechanical system enabling continuous dynamics tracking and model updating; (2) feature selection to extract the most representative inputs\/features for compact model structure; (3) model predictive control (MPC) for real-time optimization and control synthesis; and (4) innovation in software-hardware architecture to streamline NN learning, model construction, MPC on a hybrid and embedded platform to meet demanding Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements in HUMS. In Phase I, key components including a NN-based online ML module, an input\/feature selection module, a MPC module, and an embedded system architecture will be developed. Feasibility will be demonstrated via case studies of US Army interest, including real-time situational response demonstrations in a controlled simulated environment using datasets from both synthetic and real-world operations. The Phase II effort will focus on capability extension, algorithm optimization, software integration, extensive technology validation and demonstration, and technology insertion into Armys workflow."

Each RD will detect spoofing by monitoring the GPS signals, GNS-INS Kalman filter innovations, position, velocity, and time. The network of RDs will also compute a relative position estimate that will be used to protect against GPS spoofing. Once detected, spoofers will be localized on a per-channel basis to ensure localization of multiple spoofers in arbitrary configurations. The design will be documented and a fabrication plan prepared for construction during Phase II."

By starting with a silicon alloy instead of pure silicon, the initial structure is already in a stable expanded state. Mathematically stresses encountered on charging and discharging are reduced when the silicon is partially lithiated. It has been shown experimentally, there is much irreversible loss in than is encountered in pure silicon.In fact, there will be an excess of lithium contributing to extended cycle life. Cells could even be built with non-lithiated cathode materials significantly reducing the stresses as there would be no expansion and controlling the lithium transfer.This approach has a high probability of success as the alloy is compositionally the same as a charged Si anode.The study includes different alloys and alloy ratios, different particle size distributions and even surface treatment to improve interface stability.Dr. Stanley Whittingham Professor at SUNY Binghamton, Director of NECCES and a celebrated pioneer in lithium ion is a supporter of this proposal."

To achieve this goal, the DoD has identified five primary components, including a key need to leverage and integrate advanced algorithms and autonomous agents, capable of understanding their human counterparts in large systems. The Armys Common Operating Environment (COE) in general, and its Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) in particular, seek to develop a consistent approach to integration and interoperability of applications and data, including those employing machine learning (ML). To enable an effective and resilient integration of ML technology into CP CE, Aptima and its partner, Apex, propose to conduct the Mission Command - Human-centered Analysis of Machine learning Methods for Effectiveness and Resilience (MC-HAMMER) study. MC-HAMMER will produce a principled method for assessing the applicability of ML to MC tasks and processes. This approach will rely on a coupled understanding of ML methods and MC cognitive work, and will be instantiated as a model of applicability that predicts costs, benefits, and risks of particular ML-MC pairings. This methodology will directly support decisions regarding how, when, and where to use ML algorithms and automated agents within MC systems and processes."

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a flexible and scalable open-source emulation system able to deploy and analyze full Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks including eNodeB, EPC, and UE, integrated with proprietary tactical radio physical layers in EMANE framework. The LTE user-plane and control-plane functionality and standardized interfaces will be built based on OpenAirInterface (OAI), an open-source LTE software package, and extended with necessary components developed in-house or ported from other open-source frameworks. Shim Layers will be used for seamless integration of the LTE components with the EMANE platform and existing EMANE physical layer and\/or MAC layer modules without requiring modifications. New interfaces and event management mechanisms will be developed to support LTE emulations. The emulation system will allow research and experimentation on utilizing LTE for tactical communications, integrating LTE into the existing tactical communications network architecture, and analyzing the performance of various use cases. Flexible experimental settings will be supported, and users can configure which emulation plugin components to instantiate and where they reside. The emulator includes all the necessary LTE control- and user-plane components and features. Additionally, it can scale up to many eNodeBs with hundreds of UEs per eNodeB via running on commodity PC hardware."

This etch process and the resultant detectors are critical steps towards an FPA using T2SL structures and achieving small pixels, large array formats (&gt; 512512), and high optical fill factors. Performance metrics for Phase I focus on the mesa geometry and surface characteristics, but ultimate goal of the effort is to develop a manufacturable, dual-band, IR FPA that meets the needs of Army applications such as night vision and missile defense."

        "abstract": "This project aims to develop a low-cost millimeter-wave (mmW) imaging system for ground vehicles, to operate in combination with a long-wave infrared (LWIR) camera. Such a system will mitigate the challenges of driving in degraded visual environments (DVE) including night time, fog, dust, or smoke by providing real-time image of the vehicle surrounding independent from the presence of naturally occurring or man-made visual obscurants. The combination of mmW and LWIR imaging modalities enables both the detection of objects at a long range through the use of the penetrating millimeter waves and the high acuity through the use of LWIR. The operation of the mmW system is based on discrete sampling of the naturally occurring thermal mmW radiation emanating from the scene with an array of antennas, spatially coherent up-conversion of the received signals to optical domain, and analog optical processing to reconstruct the mmW image. In addition to passive imaging, active illumination mode enables detecting the distance to objects in the scene."

While LWIR cameras provide suitable image quality for navigation in daytime, nighttime, and light dust conditions, the quality degrades significantly in heavy dust, fog, or smoke conditions. The imager will be integrated together with a high resolution LWIR camera to provide enhanced vision in presence of visual obscurants. The imager will provide an outline of potential obstructions in the path of the vehicle using active MMWradar based on a set of COTS automotive radar IC. These outlines will be fused together with the high resolution LWIR images to provide sufficient context in order for the driver to avoid the obstacle. McQs approach is to use its extensive experience in embedded sensor system development, low cost radar solutions, and signal processingto create a low SWaP-C ROADE (radar for obstacle avoidance and detection in all environments) system; with a simple, intuitive user interface, which is usable in a larger system such as the DVEDCM (Drivers Vision Enhancer Display Control Module).McQs system, based on COTS hardware components, will cost "

Existing acoustic systems provide protection, but perform poorly in reverberant environments, such as urban spaces. A combination of acoustic sensors and microbolometers represents a more robust approach to addressing the threat of small arms fire.Infrared imaging technology has become smaller, more cost effective, and readily available, and can provide effective sensing in low light and visually obscured conditions. Instead of using full imaging arrays, the proposed approach uses a linear array of COTS single sensors elements with overlapping fields of view to minimize processing needs and weight. Each sensing element has a passband for the narrowband gunfire signal and a guardband looking for overlapping broadband distractors signals such as sunlight or halogen bulbs. The combination of pass and guard bands, with a temporal profile filter, allow robust false alarm rejection. The proposed system leverages an existing helmet mounted acoustic design for physical mounting, user interface, and acoustic sensing for increased false alarm rejection and improved accuracy."

        "abstract": "It is critical for soldiers and autonomous systems to quickly determine the origin of hostile fire events for well-informed and timely responses. However, there are capability gaps with current human-worn hostile-fire detection systems that rely on acoustics and muzzle flash. Kitware proposes PitViper, an autonomous helmet-mounted hostile-fire detection sensor system that tracks projectiles in flight. Unlike other systems, PitViper is fully effective (high PD, low FAR) in high-clutter urban or forested areas and does not require line of sight to the shooters location. PitViper immediately provides accurate azimuth, elevation, and range information about the shotline as well as the geolocation of the origin. PitViper combines low SWAP-C COTS hardware with Kitwares established computer vision software tools to provide real-time enhanced situational awareness. Data from an advanced high-speed microbolometer is fused with GPS\/INS pose outputs and fed into stabilization, detection, tracking, georegistration, and classification algorithms running onboard. Results are communicated using the Nett Warrior integrated dismounted leader system. Extensions include small robotic platform integration, UAV detection and tracking, and counter rocket, artillery, and mortar applications."

DZYNEs approach will fuse sensor data at the feature level within the CNN with proper adaptation in order to take advantage of the diversity of information provided by IR, depth maps derived from IR video, and other data sources when available.Accurate real-time scene labeling is a key enabling technology that will enable Cognitive Processing for Autonomy applications."

The objective of RAISIN is to improve communications in a tactical network with situational awareness and provide the commander with actionable intelligence that is represented by the value of information (VoI). The tactical network consists of artificial and human agents each equipped with embedded sensors and operating with different communication links subject to computational (processing power), bandwidth and other (such as energy) constraints. Each agent generates metadata obtained with deep learning methods describing the recorded content and decides what metadata to transmit depending on its resources. RAISIN uses deep learning to characterize the VoI for the generated metadata and assist commander to produce queries according to the mission. RAISIN also applies deep learning based information retrieval methodology to find low-cost models according to agents processing power and battery lifetime to generate metadata and handle potential errors in metadata processing. The goal is to deliver the best VoI such that the commander can make the decisions faster and with higher fidelity."

During Phase I, artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) will be explored as the classification engines. Assuming commonly encountered jammer signal models, various feature vectors will be used as inputs to these to determine the most suitable classifier and the feature sets. For cognitive anti-jamming policy learning, several RL algorithms will also be evaluated against these jammer models. A hardware-in-the-loop demo will be developed, utilizing commercial radios, to evaluate the developed cognitive anti-jamming and scheduling system in the presence of real jammer and interference."

        "abstract": "TDMA-based scheduling is widely used to coordinate transmissions for the MAC, which is typically centralized and not adaptive and therefore is not flexible in terms of allocating dynamic time slots among transmitters to adapt to spectrum and traffic dynamics. Tactical networks need to operate in contested and congested environment subject to various forms of impairments in communications due to in-network interference, out-of-network interference, channels and traffic congestion. Therefore, it is essential for distributed nodes to operate cohesively as a network and build together cognitive network knowledge. To address this critical need, IAI proposes to design and implement the DISTANCE to provide a unified framework of novel modules, including data management, deep learning based spectrum analysis, and distributed scheduling for tactical networks in contested environments. DISTANCE supports tactical nodes to sense the spectrum, characterize the communication impairments, disseminate this information over the network, and utilize distributed scheduling protocols to mitigate or alleviate these impairments and improve tactical communications."

Static analysis of source code during the development stage is a common practice. However, developers often dont have access to source code for third-party libraries. Access to any source code during software deployment is rare. This leaves cyber security analysts with the challenge of inspecting binary software. While powerful analysis tools that operate on machine code have emerged, using these tools is not trivial. Inspecting analysis results in machine code requires highly skilled users. And even a skilled user will require more time to review logic represented in machine code than a similar logic in source code. This gets even worse once static analysis warnings are reflected on top of the machine code. As a result, binary software vulnerability inspections are costly endeavors."

Controlled Radiation Pattern Antennas (CRPAs), have dominated military anti-jam solutions, however, CRPAs are costly, require a great deal of power, and are inherently limited in the number of spatial nulls that can be formed. Phase I investigates a combination of Jamming Detection and Classification with an Anti-Jam Toolbox and Machine Learning to apply the right solution with the minimum essential power consumption needed to achieve the desired performance. We will evaluate methods of using current technology to intelligently suppress jamming while minimizing the consumption of energy and consequently minimize the battery burden for dismounted soldiers and other power-limited users. We will evaluate two implementation techniques: integrating the anti-jam system in existing receivers from the ground up; or developing an external applique that can be added to receivers, replacing the antenna, or placed between the receiver and antenna. Phase I will result in a high level specification and Phase I Option will result in a detailed specification for the most suitable implementation strategy. Success in either implementation strategy holds commercialization promise for all platforms desiring a low cost and low power anti-jam solution, such as handhelds, munitions, and certain ground"

        "abstract": "Tactical Commanders must successfully integrate and manage dynamic, time-sensitive battlefield information from large numbers of heterogeneous sources to perform their jobs effectively. While new tools enable a wider distribution of Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence (C3I) information, existing systems are severely limited by procedures and methods and are not typically designed to adequately support the underlying cognitive work and information needs of tactical decision makers. To address these needs, we propose to design and demonstrate Operational Representations and Interactive Overlay Environment (ORION). This system will combine tightly coordinated, advanced data visualizations for individual information exploration and reasoning with deeply integrated collaboration tools to provide a shared understanding of the battlespace. Combined, ORION will effectively support Tactical Commanders real-time information exploration, manipulation, and exploitation of resources within a flexible and role-tailored workspace. To address key informational requirements and processing activities across a range of decision-makers, we will perform a cognitive analysis and then use the outputs of this analysis to design novel ecological interaction methods to support Commanders throughout the decision-making process. Finally, we will assess the feasibility of our proposed approach through rapid prototyping development to demonstrate information display tools and collaborative capabilities for the ORION system with representative personnel."

The proposed solution provides a process for pairing cyber-attacks with AML algorithms in order to defeat DML systems. Through the process of learning how to defeat DML systems, ADHoC will identify the precise strategies, techniques, and data that led to a successful outcome. This knowledge can then be used to construct new training sets or improved ML models that can be used to harden the DML system against similar attacks. Over multiple iterations, both the AML attacker and DML defender will improve and produce more secure systems. Siege believes that the unique combination of novel AML implementations along with a high fidelity cyber simulation and evaluation environment is innovative and will significantly raise the bar for machine learning based intrusion detection and prevention leading to more secure systems for the U.S. Army."

In this situation, network nodes will need to cooperate and coordinate negotiate ways for them to still pass information to each other despite being embedded in a congested and contested environments. Our solution will take results from machine learning and artificial intelligence and combine those with a software defined networking (SDN) concept designed for challenged tactical networks. In particular, Markov decision process (MDP) and Q-learning will be used in a reinforced learning (RL) approach to define data routing policies and media access policies in light of network conditions as input (congestion, jamming, channel fading, data delay, data bandwidth\/throughput, packet loss, node mobility, node battery power level etc.). Our SDN design contains functions and optimized data storage to enable network nodes to operate in intermittently connected network conditions, which can be considered normal operating conditions in a tactical edge network."

        "abstract": "Tactical networks face congested and contested environments characterized by intermittent connectivity due to severe jamming and interference conditions. In addition, tactical radios are limited by different levels of resources such as energy (battery lifetime), computation (processing power), and communication (range and bandwidth). Effective coordination and cooperation between agents (namely, network nodes) is necessary to manage information flows and satisfy the requirements of tactical communications. As tactical networks need to cover large areas (e.g., brigade size), they need self-organizing, self-healing and self-optimization capabilities such that nodes join, leave, and rejoin the network without manual intervention, links are repaired and rerouted autonomously, network and radio resources are utilized efficiently, and anti-jamming modes, e.g., low probability of detection\/interception (LPD\/LPI), are realized in a timely manner. IAI will address these challenges with the design and implementation of Coordination and Cooperation in Operational Networks (COCOON). COCOON is a resource-aware methodology to enable coordination and cooperation in a tactical mobile ad hoc network (MANET) that operates in congested and contested environments. Protocols of COCOON are based on a strong analytical foundation and will be verified through realistic simulations and emulation tests with real radios."

A field test (FT) sensor using this technology was built and tested at a NATO test against laser beam riders, laser range finders and laser target markers. The resolution of this sensor was 0.175 degrees. Requirements will be gathered in the first phase of the project. Based on the requirements, changes to the FT sensor will be made. The FT sensor will be used to evaluate new components and serve as the basis of the breadboard sensor that will be built for this SBIR. The sensor will accurately locate the laser source and the laser wavelength and work with continuous wave and pulsed lasers. The sensors similarity to a current missile warning sensor will allow new laser warning sensor to quickly mature to a fielded sensor."

GenXComm has developed a unique physical layer that enables wideband, tunable interference cancellation. This physical layer forms the foundation for the MAC and routing designs in this proposal. We propose to use single-frequency full duplex to enable tactical systems through intelligent frequency hopping with post-synchronization, adaptive access strategies based on jamming patterns and reduction in latency through cut-through routing. Combined, these strategies enable LPI and LPD in a tactical network by ensuring better coordination between nodes, significantly better resilience to jamming, and the ability to self-jam the medium without suffering from the resulting interference. This, combined with reduction in latency due to routing strategies such as cut-through will result in significant overall performance improvements in SWaP and efficiency in addition to strategic gains for the Army&apos;s tactical networks."

        "abstract": "Human social interaction is complicated by ambiguous identities, misinformation, misdirection, and flexible alliances. Additionally, thanks to the internet, authors can post messages from anywhere in the world, in diverse forms, and with different personas. Current solutions are challenged to accurately identify and characterize authors across platforms and data types, let alone infer authorial intent. To address this shortcoming, Aptima and its partners at The Pennsylvania State University Applied Research Laboratory propose a system to aid the intelligence analyst in identifying actors and their ambitions over time, data type, and domain. The system will rely on an ensemble of automated algorithms and techniques in machine learning, information theory, and algebraic topology to extract features from digital artifacts and match those features to one another by similarity metric. Interactive graphical and tabular representations will make authors, intents, and their intersection comprehensible. The system will integrate with other systems across domains in real-time; its modular structure will allow the addition and enhancement of functionality with minimal, if any, disruption to downstream pipelined processes. In summary, the system is intended as an essential tool for those whose business depends on understanding the implications of human social interaction, despite its vagaries."

These methods will be combined with the use of deep linguistic features, such as semantic information and other relevant metadata, to fuse authorship detection and intent recognition methods, rather than treating them as separate routines.

RP obscurants offer high yield factor and they are considered as the primary broad band obscurant material with high mass extinction coefficient in the visible band and also has weak attenuation performance in IR bands. However, large flames and high flame temperatures generated by burning RP create incendiary effects that may ignite dry vegetation, buildings or other materials in densely populated areas. In this project, a composite coating is developed to protect RP for safety and stability during handling. Additives in the composite coating will reduce the flame temperature and flame size through synergistic function, mitigating the incendiary effects in the obscurant combustion. A cost effective fabrication procedure is developed to produce the composite RP in the large scale."

Preliminary modeling projects the system will achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 with respect to the 1279 + 1294 cm-1 band of PETN (1 ug\/cm2 areal density) while achieving an interrogation rate of 100 mm2 per second, a spectral range of 300-2200 cm-1, and a resolution of 20 cm-1. Initial estimates of the proposed system size, weight, and required power are 0.3 ft3, 17 lbs, and 130 watts, respectively. The Phase I effort will develop a breadboard UV Raman sensor to validate a system model and collect Raman spectra of explosive residues. Requirements and a conceptual design for a Phase II prototype Raman sensor will be generated."

Our sensor model predicts that our proposed design will meet the demanding requirements as stated in the solicitation. To demonstrate and confirm the performance of our design, we propose to perform technology evaluation experiments using our existing UV Raman sensor as a testbed system.

These consequences can range from monetary cost to loss of human life. To make the optimal decision often requires a complete knowledge of the mission scenario. Complicating the matter is that information is often hard to obtain and time is limited, therefore the Commander must quickly prioritize which information to gather and analyze given their time-sensitive requirements. To address this challenge, we propose to design a Data Analysis Tool to Assess Value of Information for Decision-making (DATAVOID). DATAVOID uses a user interface that enables the Commander to formalize their decision-making process to optimize prioritized information requirements by probabilistically assessing the Value of Information (VoI) for any given piece of data."

        "abstract": "Between 2001 and 2011, nearly 90% of combat casualty fatalities occurred prior to reaching a properly equipped medical center, a quarter of which were deemed potentially survivable. To address these long standing point-of-injury trauma care issues within the battlefield, the military developed a prehospital trauma management approach known as Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC), significantly reducing the number of preventable deaths in the field. Unfortunately, less than 10% of the 30,000 casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan had any form of documentation of care in their medical records, TCCC included, leading to a staggering 67% of unanticipated adverse events being attributed to an error in communication between Roles of Care. The handoff of medical care documentation to subsequent roles of care is imperative to reducing the number of these events. Vivonics aims to solve this issue by developing a wearable device that accepts, stores, and disseminates previous patient care in a standardized, easy to use manner. Simple in composition and innovative in design, the proposed system will be a powerful and reliable method to transfer casualty care information on the patient through Roles of Care, regardless of the state of tactical communications."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys requirement for an alternative energy harvesting capability, powering an integrated, small, disposable, wireless, adhesive medical sensor, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a Wearable Energy Harvester (WEHAR) patch. It is based on a rugged, flexible, fluidproof, stick-on design, integrated with dual energy harvesting modules, providing an alternative-energy-driven resource powering a wireless medical sensor placed on a patient. The innovative hardware design is the integration of an ultrathin, flexible layer of photovoltaic cell array and a flexible thermoelectric generator module to utilize both available body heat energy and that from surrounding light. The novel design allows multiple WEHAR modules to route charge to one wireless medical sensor, allowing it to operate for &gt;72 hr. Thus, WEHAR directly addresses the Armys requirements for an alternative source of energy, augmenting or replacing existing batteries for medical sensors and extending their operating life. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the validity of the WEHAR design approach using a breadboard-level design, establishing a technology readiness level (TRL)-4. In Phase II, POC will build a ruggedized prototype for evaluation and field testing with medics and implement their recommendations for continued advanced development."

        "abstract": "The U.S. Army seeks to develop a novel systemic therapy for out-of-hospital management of combat-associated, non-compressible traumatic hemorrhage starting at the point-of-injury through en route care.Critical Innovations, Cayuga Biotech, NeoMatRx, KARA &amp; Associates, and Captain David Tanen MD, FAAEM, FACMT (USN, Ret.) have formed a team of medical development experts to address this important medical need. During this Phase I Base project, the team will identify functional and discriminatory program requirements and specifications, along with success criteria; perform additional laboratory studies to ensure that Nanostasis overcomes the challenges unique to the combat environment; produce a clear plan for practical deployment in the far-forward operational environment; and, produce a formal regulatory advisory letter. During the Phase I option, the team will additionally develop a quality systems plan for Nanostasis manufacturing and production and initiate the process for early pre-submission guidance from the FDA. The result of the Phase I project will be a clear plan for practical deployment in the far-forward operational environment, with emphasis on challenges unique to military medicine. In Phase II and beyond, the team will perform the additional preclinical and clinical research necessary to achieve FDA approval and drive the technology into full commercial sales."

        "abstract": "Trauma-associated non-compressible hemorrhage remains the principal cause of preventable mortality in the battlefield. Platelet transfusion is a critical component for treating such hemorrhage. However, platelets have limited portability, high risk of contamination, and short shelf-life (3-5 days), which severely limit their pre-hospital battlefield use. Improving pre-hospital utilization is currently under investigation with cold-stored and lyophilized platelets, with limited success. In this framework, there is a significant need for an IV-injectable hemostatic product with excellent portability and shelf-life, that enables platelet-mimetic hemostasis when platelets are unavailable. We have developed a synthetic nanoparticle technology, SynthoPlateTM, that can mimic platelets hemostatic functions while allowing large-scale manufacture, sterilization to reduce contamination, long shelf-life and small-volume portability for point-of-injury use. SynthoPlateTM has shown hemostatic and survival benefit in small and large animal trauma models. Building on that, the goal of this proposal is to study SynthoPlateTM stability and biofunction upon lyophilization\/reconstitution (Aim 1) and battlefield-relevant environmental exposure (Aim 2), to establish its pre-hospital logistical and functional viability. Additionally, in Aim 3 (Option), the optimal SynthoPlate-to-Platelet ratio will be established for effective hemostatic function. These in vitro studies will guide subsequent pre-clinical Phase II studies with SynthoPlateTM, to significantly advance its potential for pre-hospital hemorrhage control."

To become more resilient to these challenges, the Warfighter will need additional, innovative support to provide Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC). Intelligent decision-support software, teleoperated trauma care systems, and fully autonomous trauma care robotics are intriguing solutions. In addition to performing patient monitoring and intervention, these solutions must intelligently diagnose multiple injuries and produce prioritized treatment plans. To address these challenges, we propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of Autonomous Ruggedized Combat Casualty CareDiagnostics (ARC3-D), a modular, intelligent framework for autonomous combat casualty care. ARC3-D combines behavioral modeling based on trauma treatment algorithms and procedures with machine learning that can reason under uncertainty to continually produce and refine diagnoses of traumatic injury, as well as produce prioritized TCCC treatment plans that can then be used by intervention subsystems connected to ARC3-D."

        "abstract": "Unmanned systems and autonomous capabilities provide an avenue for improving enroute care in situations where medical evacuation assets are either not available or unable to reach the patient. A first step is to explore how intelligent algorithms can be used to supplement the current capabilities by improving the diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring of combat trauma care. Variability in the sensing technology available, environmental factors influencing the reliability of measurements, and lack of time and skills to synthesize this information can affect how data impacts treatment. The potential lack of knowledge and expertise of the on-the-site caregiver directly impacts whether important symptoms are seen, good medical decisions are made, and interventions are correctly executed. SoarTech proposes the Intelligent System Architecture for Autonomous Care (ISAAC), a software system to support medical diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring. Our ISAAC Diagnosis algorithms will support within physiological, medical imaging, and laboratory test data with an automated pipeline for processing raw data, identifying features, and mapping this information to symptoms. This information will be reasoned over by an intelligent cognitive system that uses an expert understanding of symptom-condition mappings along with a logical inference reasoner to formulate hypotheses, recommend additional tests and construct diagnoses."

Medics are trained to use communication and observation to gauge the status of the patient within the first few seconds of patient interaction as well as during ongoing monitoring; a good medic can make a priority decision--within seconds--using only their eyes and ears. Our proposed system aims to translate medic audio and visual perception to an automated patient monitoring system, enabling it to immediately start evaluating the patient through EO camera and microphone before vitals sensors have even been attached. The insights gained from monitoring will be rendered into a knowledge base which will be accessible to the diagnostics and intervention subsystems.During Phase I, Aret will develop algorithms with the goal of enabling a BATT-MD demonstration which shows the utility and feasibility of visual monitoring for automatic pose mapping and wound detection (using machine learning techniques), and audio monitoring for alertness and orientation checking (using speech-to-text and natural language processing for semantic parsing). The demonstration will include the output of a knowledge base."

        "abstract": "In a current SBIR contract, MSI has developed an intrinsically passive modular avionic module with a real time operating system and data-driven Cognitive Bayesian models that provides situational awareness. In the Phase III transition contract, the focus is a software interface for the Full Authority Digital Engine Controllers (FADEC) deployed in the MQ-9, RQ-4, C-130J, and V-22 aircraft. The EPIC is able to learn normal patterns and produce a diagnostic report when abnormal behavior or signals do not comply with requirements. We propose new work that will enhance the data models, architectural concepts, and components for use in developing a common avionic to engine interface, including data modeling for general FADEC interfaces to the avionics suite. The product will be a common, reusable software for engine controllers that are Future Airborne Capabilities Environment (FACE) Units of Portability (UoPs) compatible and that also meet airworthiness or security requirements unique to the US Army. This would ensure that as engines are updated, integration with respect to the avionics suites in use by the Army is simplified and streamlined and also that the data model for common engine information is complete."

The work will build on existing XFS ECU interfaces and the FACE alignment work already in progress in order to develop a common interface for FADECs implemented as FACE UoPs. This effort will start with examining the current engine interfaces, including the FADEC-like ECU interface implemented in XFS and alternative FADECs, to come up with a common set of data elements that could be used for any FADEC implementation. Next, Avilution will develop an architecture with layers of abstraction that maximize the variety of FADECs that can be interfaced, while also eliminating or minimizing the amount of additional code to interface with these FADECs. Finally, the architecture will be aligned with the FACE Technical Standard and strategies for conformant UoPs (which could be implemented in Phase II) will be developed.XFS architecture strategy implementation, data element translation, and FACE conformance verification will occur in the Phase I Option."

        "abstract": "A critical design challenge in bridge and other large structures is the connection parts. To achieve required structural robustness, the final connection design often ends up with a large amount of wasted material, which significantly increase raw material costs. Additionally, for military bridge connection designs with small production volume in particular, traditional manufacturing approaches are often time-consuming and cost-ineffective. Therefore, it is imperative to find an alternative effective manufacturing approach that can address current issues on costs, as well as structural weight and performances. Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes to resolve the critical challenges by combining numerical simulations, design optimization, and experimental testing with state-of-art Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies. In this study, we will use numerical simulations and design optimization approach to derive optimized lightweight lattice connection designs with high strength and durability based on various loading conditions and given structural interfaces. We will also prove the manufacturability of the connection part using Additive Manufacturing technology and perform lab\/field qualification tests. The methodology framework and software tools that we derive during this research effort can be applied to other important connection designs, such as joints for deployable large space structures."

NanoSonic&apos;s SPEA material will equip vehicle design engineers with a pioneering multipurpose automotive component that will function as both an interior trim energy absorption and spall liner material. Through previous Army SBIR funding, NanoSonic has created an interior head impact protective trim composite that exceeds the performance objectives outlined in MIL-PRF-32518 for head impact protection and fire, smoke, and toxicity (FST) resistance. NanoSonic will build from this promising technical foundation during the Phase I SBIR program to create flexible, easily installed HybridSil SPEA materials through iterative MIL-STD-662 and FMVSS 201U testing. Promising systems will advance to cone calorimetry and smoke toxicity testing in preparation for larger scale Phase II development and integration efforts. In support of a near term Phase III, HybridSil resins have a current production capacity of 8,000 lbs. \/ day, a MRL of 6, and have been integrated onto combat active DoD platforms for trial demonstrations."

        "abstract": "Army helicopter pilots have a very challenging job that requires a high level of situational awareness.Although many fighter jet HMDs (F-35 JSF, JHMCS) use off the visor optics, helicopter HMDs almost always use an optical system that puts some part of the optics in front of the pilots eyes, like in the Apache IHADSS HMD.For this system, much of the downlook on the right side of the helicopter is blocked from vision, which is critical for landing.Even the next-generation CHMD system has a large peripheral obscuration that blocks critical information from the pilots field of vision.A visor projected HMD solves the problems of obscuration and can be much lighter than an HMD with a combiner.There are numerous visor projected HMDs on the market, but they are extremely expensive.What is necessary is a low-cost, visor projected display for helicopter pilotage.Using our background in HMD design and our knowledge of advanced optics, SA Photonics is pleased to propose our Visor Projected Retrofittable (ViPR) HMD for helicopter pilotage.This system is a low-cost, state of the art design with electronics that allow it to be retrofit into helicopters both with and without a HUD\/HMD symbol generator."

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for a next generation sunlight-readable Heads-Up-Display (HUD), Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISS) proposes to develop the new Visor Projection Aviation Head-Mounted Display (VIPA-HMD) based on an innovative modular design modification of a commercially available miniature laser pico-projector microdisplay to produce an ultra-compact low-profile display light engine. The innovations of VIPA-HMD include the use of the existing spherical visor of aviator helmet, HGU-56P, with narrow-band RGB coating to form a collimator within the tight space allowed by the helmet, use of focus-free RGB laser scanned imagery for full color expanded symbology over a wide field of view, and a light engine design with a very light miniature projection head that allows use of laser protection visors and meets Common Helmet-Mounted Display (CHMD) crash standards. The system will support external video from existing HUD computers, and projects high see-through bright\/sunlight-readable imagery at a programmable focal distance for day-night conditions at low cost. In Phase I, ISS will conduct a feasibility study on commercial microdisplay products with design modifications to fit on HGU-56P helmets, build a demonstration prototype, and evaluate display performance. In Phase II ISS will build and produce VIPA-HMD prototypes, perform testing, and develop a production plan."

Both CI\/LI and FSII are also polar compounds.We propose to expand the MFAs capabilities and calibration to add both CI\/LI and FSII quantitative measurements.Additionally, we will prototype the addition of a conductivity sensor, allowing quantification of all three additives."

The proposed technology is well suited to field use due to its simple operation and instrumentation and is amenable to in-line monitoring which would provide real-time analysis capabilities.In addition, the instrumentation necessary to conduct analytical measurements is readily available on the same size scale as a smart phone, which helps meet the DoDs specification for a unit weighing less than 10 pounds."

Our team, NanoCoatings, Inc. (NCI) and Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), will down-select the most promising coating technologies and coating materials for both piston-rings and cylinder-liners. Our preliminary down-selection consists of a high TRL 7 PVD coating already demonstrated by SwRI in heavy-duty diesel engine testing, which will reduce development risks to the U.S. Army. NanoCoatings, Inc. has a similar deposition system to enable technology transfer of the SwRI coating. For the cylinder liners, NCI proposes a higher risk novel Plasma Electrolytic Deposition (PED) immersion coating technology to deposit stabilized zirconia with WS2 solid-lubricant nanoparticles. NanoCoatings has already demonstrated PED coating of steels with alumina and the PEO coversion of Zr-metal into zirconia. Consequently we have relevant experience with this approach to produce a low thermal-conductivity, thermal-barrier coatingcontaining solid-lubricantson cast-Fe liner material. Coatings will be characterized using SEM examinations for microstructure\/composition, indentations for relative adhesion\/toughness, nanoindentation for hardness and modulus, block-on-ring sliding wear tests and PLINT TE77 sliding wear tests of coated ring segments against liner segments in diesel engine lubricants."

Building upon an existing 105 C coolant SiC based motor drive, Mainstream Engineering proposes a revised SiC based motor drive that is smaller and lighter than our legacy system. The proposed SiC based motor drive is built around custom SiC modules built in collaboration with WolfSpeed, where the optimum number of MOSFETs and anti-parallel diodes is selected for the specific application. This allows for a reduction in SiC module footprint by more than 50% as compared to Mainstream existing SiC based motor drive. The SiC device switching frequency was selected to be 25 kHz (above the audio frequency range), thus minimizing the system detectability in the field. Even at this high switching frequency, the proposed motor drive is 98.8% efficient, weighs only 13 lbs, and has a high power density with almost a 2x improvement over Mainstream existing SiC based VFD."

        "abstract": "Military non-pneumatic tires are typically used in environments where the tire is susceptible to hazards such as explosions, ballistics, and road debris because they can continue to function when pneumatic tires would have typically failed from loss of air pressure. However, by varying tire pressure, pneumatic tires have the benefit of offering functionality at sustained highway speeds on paved roads and good traction in off-road terrain. There is a need for a non-pneumatic tire that can offer similar stiffness variability while still able to withstand heavy damage. FlexSys has proposed a concept that meets these objectives with their Non-Pneumatic Adaptive Stiffness Tire (N-PAST). During off-road use, the FlexSys N-PAST will offer low stiffness functionality, which will increase the tires contact patch area, thus increasing the tires traction on loose soil, mud, sand, etc. Once the vehicle moves to on-highway travel, the N-PAST will allow the operator to increase the tires stiffness to provide a smooth, quiet, low rolling resistance ride. Such adaptive performance will revolutionize tire technology for military trucks and commercial construction equipment as the tire can adapt to on-highway and off-road conditions while still capable of withstanding significant damage before losing function."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility, through modeling and simulation, of integrating engineered polyhedral Phase Transforming Cellular Matrix (PXCM) materials as a dynamic, elastically deformable solution for non-pneumatic tires that can; 1) resist loss of mobility due to hazards that include ballistic\/explosive threats, and road debris, 2) extend capability allowing the vehicle to continue its mission having sustained damage, and 3) meet the requirements for optimal performance in both on and off-highway applications. Engineered PXCM materials offer superior mechanical performance that cannot otherwise be obtained with traditional cellular structures. In particular, we surmise that PXCMs can provide good performance at relative high speed on pavement, and still provide good adaptability for the off-road environment. For tires designed to mitigate different sized obstacles, loading conditions, and variable terrain typically encountered in off-road scenarios (i.e. sand, mud, gravel, and snow), PXCMs can be designed to have an initial high stiffness and a tunable peak force\/stress, at which point the cellular material transitions to a negative stiffness regime."

        "abstract": "The efficient design and evaluation of Army vehicles requires accurate simulation of the factors that affect the vehicles infrared signature and thermal conditions inside the vehicle. The model must account for all the transient heat transfer within the vehicle, including heat from the engine, air flow within the engine compartment, exhaust system, humidity transport and ventilation inside the vehicle, the heat and moisture produced by the crew, and HVAC system performance. The simulation of cabin temperatures is important to managing the infrared signature as well as ensuring the proper functionality of vehicle electronics, and avoiding the degradation of soldier performance caused by exposure to heat and humidity.ThermoAnalytics, Inc. proposes to develop a single-solver design tool for Army ground vehicles. This tool will be based on the signature prediction code MuSES (Multi-Service Electro-Optic Signature) that predicts the transient thermal behavior and EO-IR signature of vehicles and humans. The prediction of air flows and convection within the crew cabin, engine compartment and exhaust system, as well as wind convection across the exterior of the vehicle, will be modeled with a fluid flow solver that is an integral part of MuSES."

This production is becoming increasingly important as the need for legacy system replacement parts, high-customization applications, and location of production close to the demand for parts expands.In this Phase I SBIR project, Grid Logic will address limitations of other additive manufacturing and conventional manufacturing methods. It will enable cost-effective production for medium to large-format parts. The project will focus on low-quantity, high-variant manufacturing of metal parts with casting-equivalent properties.Work will include development of a new kind of casting mold technology enabled by Grid Logics multi-material additive manufacturing printer.The research will address the key elements of the new method that permit part production with little or no handling. At the conclusion of the Phase I work, Grid Logic will have shown the potential of the new technology for a family of parts relevant to Army needs."

The tool will integrate three modules: (1) Physics-Based Vehicle-Terrain Modeling tool; (2) Geographic Information System (GIS); and (3) Stochastic Design-Of-Experiments (DOE) Mobility Expert System. The physics-based vehicle and terrain modeling tool integrates into one solver: Multibody Dynamics for modeling the rigid vehicle and obstacle components, the Finite Element Method for modeling flexible bodies (including tires, suspension components, and vegetation), a Discrete Element Method complex terramechanics model, a height-field fast simple terramechanics model, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for modeling fluids (including water flooded terrains and liquids in tanks carried by the vehicle). Calibration and validation test procedures for the Physics-Based Modeling tool will be developed using small-scale terramechanics experiments and full-scale instrumented vehicles. GIS will store the terrain topography, soil, vegetation, and obstacle parameters. GIS will also be used to display the output mobility maps. The DOE expert system will be used to create a set of DOE physics-based vehicleterrain runs, then, based on the output, generate stochastic terrain maps of the mobility metrics."

        "abstract": "The US Army currently uses the Armored Vehicle-Launched Bridge (AVLB) to temporarily span gaps in the terrain such as rivers, ravines or replace blown-up bridges. The launch system utilizes an in-bridge hydraulic cylinder and cable-pulley system to deploy and retrieve the 63-foot-long scissor type bridge. This hydraulic cylinder and cable- pulley system is bulky, heavy and adds significant load to the bridge (approximately 5,000 lbs.). Furthermore, the hydraulic system requires heavy maintenance to the hydraulic lines. In this submission we propose an innovative solution to replace the current heavy hydraulic cylinder and cable\/pulley system in deploying and retrieving the bridge within the time limits set by the Army. The actuation system for the proposed solution includes a power screw, a DC motor, a gear box and a power modulator (converter). The required power will be provided by a set of batteries.It is expected that the structure of the proposed solution and the components necessary for actuation and power will weigh less than the current hydraulic cylinder and cable\/pulley system with an estimated weight savings of 35%. In addition, the proposed solution will require less maintenance and will be more reliable."

        "abstract": "The Navy is looking for safe, non-lithium advanced battery technology to replace Ag-Zn primary batteries for submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) application. Apart from safety, the critical requirements for the battery include 25+ years shelf life without any maintenance and 5+ hours of useful runtime once activated. Lynntech proposes magnesium based primary battery technology which provides much safer option compared to the reactive lithium or sodium based batteries. Another advantage of magnesium as anode is its high volumetric capacity due to the divalent nature of Mg2+ ions (3832 mAh cm-3 for Mg vs. 2062 mAh cm-3 for Li and 1136 mAh cm-3 for Na). The Phase I project will focus on proving feasibility of the advanced battery technology to reach &gt; 100 Wh\/kg energy density, long shelf life and fast response desirable for the SLBM application. A prototype design for a 30V nominal 22Ah battery will be prepared for subsequent demonstration in the Phase II project. Since magnesium is much more abundant than lithium or sodium metals, in addition to being safe and energy dense, the proposed battery technology will be much cheaper than lithium, sodium and Ag-Zn batteries, which makes it commercially attractive for consumer electronic market."

        "abstract": "Affordability, safety and reliability are major objectives of Navy Strategic System Program for continued life extension of the D5 Trident Missile. Currently, silver zinc reserve batteries are being employed in those missile systems. Silver zinc batteries have the advantage of high energy density, high power density and excellent safety. However, silver zinc batteries have the drawbacks of short shelf life (7+ years) and very high cost (up to $20,000\/kWh). Submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) have storage lives of more than 25 years, so it is desirable to develop a battery that can last as long as the SLBMs without maintenance issues and capacity loss. Therefore, there exists a strong market pull for the development of a high energy density battery for SLBM applications. In this SBIR program, a novel high energy density reserve battery is proposed. In the Phase I program, the feasibility of this battery system will be confirmed. Analysis based on our preliminary data indicates that this novel battery can meet the energy density and power requirements of this solicitation; it can also have over 25 years of maintenance-free shelf life and cost from 1\/20 to 1\/10 of current silver zinc reserve batteries."

At present, sea state estimation is made by Navy personnel and is dependent on their level of experience.Creare proposes to develop a Sea State Predictor (SSP) to provide a more accurate and reliable determination of the current sea state. The system relies on measurement of heave of the warping tug as it is driven directly into the prevailing seas at a constant speed. The resulting heave measurements of the tug are then used to determine the current sea state. Creares SSP is designed to be a stand-alone unit that offers convenient mounting options. The system leverages off-the-shelf hardware components to reduce development risk and reduce cost and required development time."

Adding complexity to their design, it is necessary to implement components and circuits to withstand highly energetic particle events associated with nuclear detonation. Creare proposes a concept to employ a rapid circumvention and recovery (C&amp;R) strategy to enable electronics and critical data survival during such an event while requiring limited radiation hardening. Innovative firmware optimizes process timing and sequencing during C&amp;R to ensure hardware survival and decrease latencies associated with GPS signal reacquisition. The objective of Phase I will be to establish a nominal architecture to demonstrate operational features of the C&amp;R architecture. This architecture includes hardware interconnection and firmware development culminating in a total system assessment of immunity to a specified total ionization dose and related single event effects of onset gamma particles. During Phase II the architecture will evolve to endure upsets designed to affect electrical performance and perturbations in data where enhanced protection circuitry, component\/data redundancy, and error detection\/correction will be refined to counter these adversities. A detailed modular simulation of the entire system will be executed to verify performance prior to actual RH testing."

Tanner Researchs Phase I proof of concept hardware development is focused on developing and implementing the proof of concept high voltage switch, and secondly on integrating the switch into a COTS-type TRL-7 ESAD for empirical demonstration. Accordingly, the solid state discharge switch, with no moving parts, will provide accurate single- or multipoint timing, and repeatable operation for warhead and rocket motor fuzing applications. Objectively, the silicon-based discharge switch is being developed for reliable, low-cost insertion in electronic fuzing architectures, as well as providing robustness in high-G and high-radiation environments, along with repeatable operation for multi-option fuzing applications. Fundamental to this approach is the need for cost effective alternatives to existing solid-state trigger switches that have increased electronic fuzing costs to the point of infeasibility."

To address this need, Architecture Technology Corporation (ATCorp) proposes an innovative technology called Transponded Satellite Communications Ad-hoc Networking modem-embedded Router (T-SCANR) to provide a full networking capability to the non-networking capable WAMS waveforms for optimized utilization of satellite resources. The T-SCANR approach will overcome the challenges of ad-hoc networking for transponded satellites and offer the following advantages: 1) a novel signaling scheme and distributed channel management enabling robust on-demand link establishment and management of multiple simplex links; 2) cross-layer optimization supporting efficient IP networking including both unicast and multicast. All embedded router functions will be developed to run on the WAMS modems General Purpose Processor (GPP) subsystem, enabling fast deployment of a cost-effective solution to improved satellite resource utilization."

        "abstract": "In this proposal, we consider a new design of a pneumatic brake system for heavy tactical vehicles with better technical characteristics and functional abilities in comparison with existing disc and drum brake technology. Using validated learning through the build-measure-learn feedback loop we rapidly developed minimum viable products that have been demonstrated in the lab environment. Advantages of our developments in sphere service brake application include the following: 1) The first brake system which does not require wheel removal to change brake pads at the wheel end; 2) Due to inherent design, the brake itself produces more torque in a much smaller wheel end package by 50%; and 3) to address a reduction in capital costs associated with new product integration, the products have been engineered to bolt on to existing drum and disc configured axles while integrating with ABS. We have installed the sphere brake technology on a Class 8 Heavy Duty truck. Phase I will focus on integrating our technology from a Mack truck to the MTVR and LVSR platforms."

The combination of corrosion, brake system weight, physical brake system packaging, and inherent design and material characteristics impacts safety, performance, operational availability, maintenance time, logistics and total vehicle ownership costs.Integration of a novel brake system technology is proposed to reduce the technical braking issues related to mobility, fuel economy, and safety, as well as reduce total ownership cost of USMC vehicles. The novel technology is centered on a patent-protected lightweight aluminum (Al) metal matrix composite (MMC) brake drum coupled with a reformulated brake lining friction material that provides a direct replacement option for standard cast grey iron or steel brake drum and brake lining pairings."

Great strides have been made to improve access to the myriad of Department of Defense enterprise and open source, publicly available data sources. Unfortunately, while access to data has been significantly improved, the technology required to aggregate, fuse, and exploit these data sources has not kept up. To resolve this issue, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation proposes the Rapid Automated Data Ingestion for Universal Search (RADIUS) system to enable the inclusion of new data sources and maintaining support for changing data sources as required to fulfill the Navy intelligence mission. The RADIUS system will utilize recent advancements in machine learning to achieve the overall goals of the proposed effort including automatically adapting to new and modified data sources; handling the necessary volume, variety, variability, velocity, and veracity of data; and providing a consistent global intelligence picture. The system will blend both supervised and unsupervised machine learning to provide a solution robust to the dynamic ingest environment, while minimizing manual work."

The proposed solution will integrate machine learning algorithms to support automated load-based resource allocation, data classification, and automated updates to schemas as changes occur. PUNCHs solution will be highly available and persist data using a fault-tolerant and high-performance storage layer designed to handle streaming data inputs. This will be accomplished via three primary technical objectives: 1) formalize a flexible hierarchical ontology for classifying incoming data; 2) prototype an ETL pipeline that reliably processes, transports, and stores data streams, while tracking provenance; and 3) automatically infer input schemas and intelligently assign labels to incoming data. The hierarchical ontology of Objective 1 will provide the structure and initial content of the schema registry embedded within the ETL pipeline described in Objective 2. Additionally, the decision tree structure of this ontology will allow for easily interpretable labelling decisions made by the random forest classifier described in Objective 3, as at each node of the graph, the model determines which path should be followed to maximize classification accuracy. The classification model in Objective 3 outputs classification labels to incoming data streams."

To enable this long-term operation, a robust and maintenance free power source is needed to provide a stable and continuous supply of electric power. In this Phase I SBIR program, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes to develop a compact sonobuoy power source. ACT will leverage its experience and expertise in thermal management technologies to design this power source for both efficient conversion and deployment during operation, as well as for safe handling and transport during storage before deployment. The proposed sonobuoy power source will meet the target power requirements (5W continuous) and shelf life for safe storage. Through the Phase I and Phase II programs, ACT will develop and fabricate a prototype, which would be delivered to Navy for future testing."

The proposed technology will continuously extract and convert to electrical power the hydrodynamic kinetic energy of ocean waves that are available in abundance at sea. The generated power will be used to continuously recharge an onboard battery for sustaining the sonobuoys long-term functionality and will be capable of a six-year or longer storage life. The project will develop the system design and provide proof of concept. The new energy harvesting technology to be developed in this project will also be readily adaptable to meet a wide variety of other military and commercial power needs."

(PSI) will demonstrate a high power primary battery design that can be stored in an inert state and rapidly activated on demand to provide &gt;3500W\/L, 450Wh\/L and 150Wh\/kg. This battery will increase the achievable energy and thus operating duration of active and passive Navy sonobuoys. The increased energy and power density will be achieved by using PSIs high active (HA) cathode electrodes together with its novel lithium metal cell construction and operating techniques. These technologies maximize the active content in the final cell. During Phase I, PSI will demonstrate the ability to construct cells that deliver the targeted performance. Testing will highlight the ability to store cells in an inert state and activate them again to provide the same performance. The cell designs and techniques demonstrated in Phase I will be used to design and model the performance of the prototype battery to be constructed during Phase II. The option effort will evaluate the cell performance after extended storage at various ambient conditions. Successful completion of these efforts will demonstrate the readiness of the technology for further scale-up and demonstrations in Phase II."

        "abstract": "The Submarine Force is phasing out conventional optical periscopes in favor of digital sensor masts that electronically transmit video to the Control Center. However, digital imagery suffers from distortions due to weather and lighting variations in the scene and water on the lens, which in turn, decreases watchstanders situational awareness and ability to detect targets. While methods for improving these image degradations exist, they must be applied manually by skilled operators. We propose to develop Objective Sensor Manipulation for Optimized Submarine Imaging Systems (OSMOSIS) to automatically assess image quality and recommend enhancements for the operator to apply. OSMOSIS consists of two main software components. First, an automated image quality monitoring component analyzes input imagery and computes a General Image Score (GIS), which is higher for better quality images and decreases as image quality degrades (e.g., as motion blur or noise level increases). When GIS drops too low, OSMOSIS warns the watchstander that poor image quality could compromise situational awareness. The second component, an image enhancement wizard, then suggests camera parameter changes, filters, and image processing algorithms to improve image quality. Once the corrections are applied, OSMOSIS continues to monitor image quality and provide feedback to watchstanders."

This filter will be designed to remove metal contaminants without adversely affecting or removing fuel additives, offering a viable path to avoid costly removal and replacement of existing shipboard fueling systems. Our approach will reduce Cu contaminant under 10 ppb while maintaining fuel specifications and thermal oxidation stability standards. Capital and operating costs are low due to the systems high capacity, simple operation and cartridge-replacement ease of renewal. At the end of Phase II we expect to develop an external, compact filter system that can be retrofitted to existing JP-5 shipboard fueling systems, capable of processing fuel at a rate of several hundred gallons per minute with a potential added cost of operation as low as under 0.1 cent per gallon of fuel processed and filter lifetime suitable for carrier operations. Our approach offers to bypass issues stemming from the presence of catalytic copper in JP-5 fuel which creates maintenance and repair issues associated with the auto-oxidative degradation of jet fuel, such as coking, for aircraft engines as well as impairs engine performance capability."

        "abstract": "As jet fuel flows through the CuNi fuel lines in aircraft fueling system and subsystems, copper is dissolved into the fuel. This copper contamination in the fuel is a problem because the copper catalyzes oxidation reactions that cause hydrocarbons in the fuel to decompose to elemental carbon and form deposits on fuel lines, valves, injectors, and combustion chamber surfaces in enginesTDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a novel sorbent-based chemical filtration system to produce copper-free fuel for aircraft engines. TDAs sorbent consists of a mesoporous sorbent that is modified with surface functional groups have been shown to be highly active for binding Cu2+ ions. TDAs proprietary mesoporous organo-alumina sorbent is produced by chemically modifying low-cost commercially available boehmite. The structure of our sorbent provides high surface area, large pores for good mass transfer, and a large population of copper trapping groups. The sorbent filter can be fitted into a compact cartridge that can be placed directly into the fueling system. The sorbent works at ambient temperature. The passive filter does not need any specialty gases or solvents."

        "abstract": "Vishwa Robotics plans to develop and demonstrate a novel, shock proof electromechanical actuator called CESAR for Unmanned Undersea and Surface Vehicles (UxV) control surfaces in a high sea-state ocean environment. Unlike conventional surface ships, UxVs are expected to survive and operate in (rather than retreat from) extreme ocean environmental conditions (World Meteorological Organization (WMO) sea-state 7 and above). The UxVs control surfaces and actuators must be capable of sustaining high levels of force and acceleration incurred when being tossed and dropped by large waves while also being sufficiently compact and lightweight to be integrated into the platform. Conventional commercial actuator components are comprised of a motor and gearing; the gears and associated bearings are especially vulnerable to damage under high shock levels under huge back driving forces. CESAR provides high power density similar to hydraulic pistons while providing reliability and low maintenance of electromechanical drive. Unlike artificial muscle actuators such as EAP, the Vishwa CESAR can function at any depth, any environment such as chemical, corrosive, high temperature, cryogenic conditions or high pressure and space. Also unlike artificial muscle actuators CESAR provides force density and bidirectional displacement comparable to hydraulic pistons."

        "abstract": "Unmanned undersea and surface vehicles must be comprised of equipment that can endure the strenuous conditions present in the ocean environment. This may include high shocks caused by battering of ocean waves and intense pressures. Both can cause detrimental damage to moving parts and mechanical equipment, in particular small scale and delicate motor parts present in unmanned systems, and may result in a significantly shortened operation lifetime. One possible remedy exists in the form of electroactive polymers, which typically have the benefit of high elasticity and long lifetime, as well as the added benefit of ionic or electric conductivity. As a result of their unique properties, they have been of great interest in recent years for a wide variety of potential applications such as in artificial muscles and soft robotics. Mainstream proposes a compact design for a rotary electroactive polymer based actuator designed for unmanned undersea and surface vehicles (UxV) suitable for use in seawater environments. The chosen electroactive polymer and unique high surface area electrode components will ensure the low power consumption requirements, while the miniaturization and reduction of mechanical parts will reduce likelihood of damage from shock found in ocean surface environments."

The concept will be developed into a CAD model for modeling and simulation analysis. A reduced-function small-scale SMEE prototype will be fabricated and tested to validate its design concept. In Phase I Option, POC will develop the initial design specifications, capabilities description, and Phase II plan for building and testing a prototype solution. In Phase II, POC will develop, build, and deliver a small-scale SMEE prototype for proof of concept testing. This prototype will be evaluated and tested to produce empirical data verifying mating capabilities in shallow water at increased internal pressures at 0 degrees and 45 degrees list. We will use the Phase II results to develop Phase III plan to transition the technology for Navy production and potential commercial use."

        "abstract": "The Navy requires affordable and robust cryogenic cooling solutions for use in High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) cable technology. Currently, gaseous helium is cooled by a cryocooler through a cryogenic heat exchanger and circulated using a helium circulation fan through a superconducting cable. While Stirling refrigerators are commonly used in the cryogenics industry, they do not scale well to large capacities and inherently exhibit significant vibration due to their piston-based operation. Therefore, Concepts NREC (CN) proposes to develop a reverse-Brayton cryocooler. Reverse-Brayton cryocoolers offer several unique advantages, such as high-capacity cooling at high efficiency, and long life without maintenance due to wear-free and vibration-free components. Indeed, reverse-Brayton cryocoolers are inherently high-capacity systems, and rely on turbomachinery with noncontact bearings, resulting in wear-free and vibration-free operation. During Phase I, CN will complete the design of the cryocooler system, including its key components: the compressor, the turbine and the recuperator. During the Phase I Option, CN will perform risk reduction activities in preparation for Phase II. During Phase II, CN will build and test the cryocooler."

This need is largely driven by the continued development of high power density advanced weapons systems and sensors. Continued space and weight limitations for these ship applications will drive the need for new power solutions to be light and compact, easing installation on new ships and enabling upgrades on existing ones.To meet this need, highly efficient methods of transferring large amounts of power are being investigated by NSWC Carderock in Philadelphia through the use of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS). HTS technology provides dramatically increased current density over conventional conductors, but they do require cryogenic cooling to achieve the superconducting state. Low power Stirling based cryocoolers have been developed by the Navy to cool superconducting cables in low voltage DC applications such as degaussing. AC power cable applications will require larger capacity cryocoolers to manage the thermal loads associated with large input currents as well as the AC losses associated with superconductors during AC power transfer. These larger coolers will also need to be more efficient then their lower capacity predecessors if shipboard implementation is to be achieved."

        "abstract": "Advances in sensor technology and new capabilities within towed arrays are demanding high bandwidth communications links between the towed array and the host vessel. While fiber optic tow cables exist, retrofitting the fleet of submarines to accommodate the new cables is cost prohibitive. To address this issue, NuWaves Engineering proposes the Innovative Towed Array Cable Modem (INTERCOM). INTERCOM leverages advanced 5G enabling technology and adapts it to the special requirements for operating deep under water and within the limitations posed by the coaxial tow cable. Due to highly integrated components, INTERCOM will be able to meet the Navys requirement of 225 Mbps throughput within the 0.75 diameter by 5.25 cylinder."

The novel fiber-optic based RF-Photonics tunable filter system has several advantages over conventional approaches, including ultra-narrow bandwidth with top-flat, high resolution, large tuning range, fast response, and low power consumption. The technical approach will be proven in Phase I through numerical analysis, design, and experiments. The fully functional prototype module will be produced and tested in Phase II for delivery to the Navy."

        "abstract": "The Navys mission of global force projection and logistic support requires surface ships and naval aviation assets to be deployed worldwide with little supporting infrastructure for communications. Airborne units provide extended line of sight for network connectivity between surface vessels as well as contributing unique sensor capabilities. The use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as airborne nodes for communications will provide additional capability to ensure uninterrupted connectivity throughout the fleet, but for a variety of naval UAS platforms to easily serve in this role a scalable and affordable airborne phased array antenna is required. FIRST RF has developed an industry-leading phased array architecture that is uniquely suited to address this need. This phased array approach is based on a modular building block that combines the RF, electronic, thermal, and mechanical features of a phased array antenna into a low-cost subassembly. This active antenna module is easily manufactured and tested using standard high volume printed circuit processes. FIRST RF has had dramatic success applying this approach to X-Band for airborne radar and Ku-Band communications. Translating this technology to C-Band promises to yield a cutting-edge phased array solution for the Navy with rapid transition to the fleet."

AVX will capitalize on the companys experience designing and developing light weight, reliable drive systems for multiple rotorcraft applications including USMC MV-22.AVX is presently testing our designed 2000 SHP gearbox developed for the DARPA Tern UAV, with our end-to-end experience on design development and manufacture of lightweight gearboxes. AVX recently completed an ADD-AMRDEC contract for Ultra Reliable Design that included a complete review of all gearboxes on the UH-60, AH-64 and CH-47, including root-cause analysis of all field usage. All this combined experience will enable AVX to support PMS377 goals for significant performance and maintenance improvements for the SSC. Based on recent experience AVX would design the baseline gearbox and subcontract the manufacture of the gears, bearings and housings. AVX would then assemble and test the gearbox in a new facility in Fort Worth, Texas. This facility would provide AVX Aircraft the opportunity to provide gearboxes for commercial and military customers for rotorcraft and Naval vessels."

        "abstract": "The primary gearbox components on board the Navys Air Cushioned Vehicle (ACV) platforms are operationally essential components of the crafts propulsion system. The current cast-aluminum housing and metallic gear components are of substantial weight and require significant maintenance throughout the life of the craft primarily due to operations in a harsh salt-laden environment. Material and design improvements to make the gearboxes lighter, easier to maintain, and higher performance, with minimal impacts to existing support and sub-systems would allow for more operational performance of the vehicle at lower life cycle costs. The innovation and opportunity offered in this proposal to meet the program objective is an approach for simultaneously reducing the weight and maintenance costs through the implementation of Fiber Reinforced Composite (FRC) materials and corresponding design solutions. Performance improvements will be achieved through the integration of FRC materials into optimized gearbox design solutions previously developed for LCAC-100 program. To accomplish this objective, an Integrated Product Team (IPT) of material specialists at Materials Sciences Corporation as well as gearbox designers\/manufacturers at Cincinnati Gearing Systems has been assembled to develop lightweight, advanced material solutions and joint designs for Form-Fit-Function replacement gearboxes for the LCAC-100."

        "abstract": "The Expendable Mobile Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Training Target (EMATT) is a vital tool in the Navys ASW toolkit. Currently, the EMATT is programmed via the Field Programmability System (FPS), composed of the Run Geometry Application (RGA) and the Portable Target Programmer (PTP). However, The PTP is expensive, frequently unreliable, slow in downloading and limited in battery capacity. Recent advances in battery chemistry and data transfer technology open several avenues for potential improvement. In response to SBIR solicitation N181-074, OASIS has formed a team with Lockheed-Martin. Here, we propose to apply our extensive experience in EMATT operations to upgrading the FPS, focusing on eliminating the weakest link, the PTP. To accomplish this, OASIS intends to enable wireless communications between RGA and EMATT. This requires alternative power sources, including batteries with greater capacity and shorter recharge times and an AC\/DC power supply, eliminating the need for battery power when appropriate. The Phase I Base will culminate in a proof-of-concept demonstration using existing RGA software hosted on a laptop to wirelessly program an EMATT on battery and AC power. The Phase I option will then define the path forward, toward a prototype FPS upgrade to be produced in Phase II."

However, the FPS fails to meet user expectations in terms of reliability, maintenance, human factors, and battery technology. Sonalysts will develop and articulate an upgrade strategy for the MK 39 FPS that considers multiple technical options to resolve the system shortcomings, and identify the leading candidate architecture for further development during Phase II. Central to the effort is a functional analysis that will identify the barriers to optimal performance in two of the key functional areas of the FPS. With regard to power storage, Sonalysts will investigate and characterize advanced battery chemistries and battery management systems to improve capacity and depth-of-discharge; increase battery life; and reduce weight and volume. In the area of data communications, we will investigate multiple communications options to best reduce the number of data transfers and shorten their duration while simplifying cabling requirements."

OptTek will extend and enhance its existing OptDef simulation optimization and analysis toolkit to provide a proof of concept ACS M&amp;S optimizer for ASCM analysis and demonstrate it on a sample optimization scenario. Using a simulation optimization approach, Phase I will explore how software-only changes can impact the performance of the ACS with a specific focus on countering evolving ASCM threats. In later work, this approach will be easily extensible to consider other criteria of interest to the broader ACS missions.To achieve the desired performance improvements of the ACS, OptTek will develop a comprehensive understanding of the ACS AAW components and the M&amp;S suite that represents them within the ATB, determine performance metrics of interest when countering ASCM threats and identify operationally-meaningful scenarios, and develop a proof of concept ACS optimizer to integrate with a test example in the ATB."

        "abstract": "The Navy and the DoD have made a substantial investment in fiber-based high-energy lasers (HELs). Low size, weight and power (SWaP) is required for deployment of the HELs on mobile platforms. The SWaP of fiber-based HELs is largely dictated by the efficiency and SWaP of laser diode fiber coupled modules (FCMs). SRLs patent protected ITAR technology provides the highest efficiency and lowest SWaP FCMs for several reasons including:It uses high fill-factor (20%) laser diode bars with emitter spacing of 500 microns,Lowest resistance microchannel coolers that preserve efficiency and brightness at high operating power, andDirect bonding of the laser diode bars to the copper microchannel coolers. Under Phase 1, SRL will experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of a 60% efficient, kilowatt, low-SWaP (0.6cc\/W, 0.6g\/W) FCM. Such FCMs are essential for ship-based defense. It is noteworthy that there are no state-of-the-art or commercial-off-the-shelf kilowatt FCMs available. In Phase 2 SRL will deliver six, 60% efficient low-SWaP FCMs to a facility of the Navys choosing. These FCMs will be the basis for demonstrating a &gt;45%, 5kW high-power fiber laser."

        "abstract": "High Energy Laser (HEL) weapons will dramatically transform naval warfare, providing substantial supremacy to the military forces having the most capable HEL systems. However, this supremacy can only be realized if the platform on which the laser weapon is deployed can support its power requirements. For many moving platforms, such as navy vessels and aircraft, power is a precious resource. At the same time, the size and weight of the laser weapon should be low enough that it can be inserted in the vehicle platform. For many navy vessels, aircraft and ground vehicles space is at a premium. Thus, the practical deployment of HEL weapons and the maximization of their lethal capability, strongly depend on increasing the laser system efficiency under operating conditions and reducing the size and weight from the current state-of-the-art. The efficiency, size and weight of the diode laser pump modules, the heart of the system, have a strong impact on the overall HEL size, weight and power consumption (SWaP). Thus, the goal of this program is to design, fabricate and test novel multi-kilowatt, high efficiency, low size and weight diode laser pump fiber coupled modules (FCMs)."

The proposed solution will increase the power density of naval power electronics to levels required to be strategically located, lower maintenance cost, and increase reliability over current solutions.

Corvids unique predictive High Fidelity Computational Physics (HFCP) simulation tools, supercomputing facilities, and PID analysis experience will be leveraged to successfully model surface to air missile interceptor debris including all components from both the interceptor and the target. The proposed approach is agnostic to specific interceptor and target combinations for maximum flexibility. Our Phase I approach will facilitate a successful Phase II transition beginning with the development of prototype software."

The original Maximum Entropy Model for Debris assumed breakup of a homogeneous solid under uniform expansion. Since an interceptor and target are neither homogeneous or experience uniform expansion, any generalized model must include methods of representing the material composition and configuration of both interceptor and target, and the dynamics of impact, without requiring the full fidelity of a hydrocode model of the bodies. HTSI proposes to redevelop the MEM using a matrix formulation for composition and configuration, representing simplified but realistic physics, which can be linearized and solved numerically. The results of this process will be compared to other models, such as the Kinetic Impact Debris Distribution models, for fidelity and evaluation."

        "abstract": "While approaches exist to plan and operate autonomous unmanned systems (AUS) in isolated contexts, the inclusion and optimization of AUS in theater-level total force planning is unresolved. We propose TIMPS, a toolset of mission planning algorithms and HMI to enable theater-level planning and drive down manned support requirements for USW and other missions. TIMPS design is based on three key insights: 1. Kill chain and similar missions require continuity, which depends on access to infrastructure services (e.g. power\/fuel, resupply, comms, C2\/exfil, PNT, autonomy, battle management); 2. Optimization of mission assets, especially AUS, requires an understanding of the asset-specific planners and behaviors; and 3. The ability of human operators to specify and manage these complex missions requires specialized HMI tools and representations. TIMPS is thus focused on 1. Optimizing the placement of infrastructure and mission assets to ensure continuous mission execution, 2. Learning the behaviors and interfacing to asset-specific planners, and 3. Providing user-understandable HMI tools and representations. TIMPS will be adapted and integrated from SSCI technologies developed under DARPA programs, including CNAV, DASH, ACTUV, and CDMaST, along with multi-vehicle tasking algorithms from MITs Aerospace Controls Laboratory, represented by Professor Jonathan How as a consultant on this proposed effort."

SIFT brings a substantial array of state-of-the-art technology to bear on M-PRIMUS: (1) Playbook HSI will enable mission commanders to rapidly and flexibly convey their intent and maintain global awareness of multiple mixed manned and unmanned undersea, (2) SHOP2 will generate effective tasking of manned and unmanned assets within the acceptable boundaries of the commanders intent and global usage of resources, (3) THOR will provide alternative COAs by repairing mission plans, (4) MURPHY will generate critiques and explanations of how mission plans can fail, and (5) LOCI will serve both as a testbed for plan evaluation and as a subsequent interface for existing Navy legacy systems. In sum, M-PRIMUS will significantly empower TUSW mission planners by distributing manned and unmanned resources effectively across plans and across different missions, enabling them to improve total mission quality and force effectiveness and reducing the risk to manned units as the risks will already be analyzed and mitigated by M-PRIMUS before they are realized."

Software testing and analysis, which is used to combat bugs, is difficult, and thus time-consuming and expensive. It is particularly difficult to find latent bugsbugs that do not have obvious, observable effects on the system. This results in undiscovered and unfixed bugs in the system. New approaches to automated software testing offer the opportunity to catch bugs with less time and cost than manual approaches. To achieve this, ATC-NY will develop Argus, an automated software testing tool that finds latent errors in a program by analyzing large amounts of testing output. Argus uses big-data machine learning techniques to autonomously analyze records of program behavior to find and prioritize anomalous behavior that may indicate an undiscovered software bug."

By applying machine learning, these data will allow AEGIS and other programs to: 1. Detect latent errors in combat systems based on extremely complex software, 2. Develop meaningful test coverage metrics for MIL-STD-882E risk analysis, 3. Proactively target automated robustness testing to address residual risks, 4. And, ultimately, to improve cost effectiveness of Navy integration efforts. Phase I of our project will define pattern-recognition algorithms inspired by machine-learning techniques from natural-language processing, deep learning, and defect analysis. We will determine the feasibility of these algorithms based on representative data sets provided by the AEGIS program office and available via open source repositories, identified in collaboration with AEGIS program personnel at Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems (LM RMS). These data sets may be augmented with test data already available to the Switchboard automated-testing platform maintained by Edge Case Research. In collaboration with LM RMS, we will produce a capabilities description document and a roadmap showing how AEGIS SQA processes can adopt our technology starting with prototypes in Phase II."

The ability to launch and recover a variety of sized UUVs effectively from a variety of naval vessels with different missions presents a tactical advantage that currently does not exist. To support continued advances in the use of underwater robotic systems for the Navy, a Common Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Stern Launch and Recovery System (LARS) is proposed. The conceptual design leverages and builds upon existing soft robotics technology, a subfield of robotics dedicated to conformal materials, by applying highly compliant materials for the in-water capture mechanism. The compliant capture mechanism floats off the stern of the vessel and is attached to an inflatable lower ramp, which in turn is hinged to an aluminum telescopic upper ramp. The system is fully retractable, housed in a portable containerized platform. The system is designed to decouple the ships motions from the LARS to reduce the transmission of torsional and vertical motions of the vessel to the UUV during capture. Analysis and simulation, using Navateks already developed and validated hydro-mechanical modeling tools, will be conducted to provide and initial assessment of concept performance."

        "abstract": "Netted warfare can be used in anti-air warfare (AAW), but its adoption has been suboptimal. A contributing factor to the lack of adoption of netted warfare in AAW is the lack of understanding by the warfighter as to the benefits of netted warfare. To resolve this, SimVentions is proposing a training game named Fleet Defense: Cooperative Engagement. The game will provide a sailor with the opportunity to experience firsthand the benefits of netted warfare. The game will also have a scenario builder that allows instructors to easily build new levels that stress specific training objectives related to netted warfare. The game will be a low fidelity 3d game which places the player in control of a group of ships and allows them to respond to various air threats presented as a scenario unfolds. The game will also have a training mode which allows the user to pause the game to get additional information available due to the netted status of their forces. The intent is to create a game which is engaging in its gameplay so that sailors will voluntarily play, but also reinforces netted warfare concepts, thus speeding the adoption of netted warfare for AAW."

        "abstract": "To maintain the United State Navys dominance in the maritime environment it is imperative to continue to develop a more integrated naval battle force. This has led the Navy to invest in capabilities to enhance its distributed lethality by aggregating disparate sensor networks to create a common situational awareness, coordinated engagements, and distributed resource control. However, creating a netted fighting force represents a complex coordination among engineering, acquisitions, and research communities that requires each community to consider its own role within the overall mission objective to best support netted force concepts. This necessitates a learning environment to maintain and achieve proficiencies in netted force concepts. To satisfy this need we propose to develop AWARE: Anti-air Warfare Awareness and Readiness Environment. AWARE will be a realistic, portable learning environment that will teach the conceptual, non-intuitive value of an integrated Naval battle force in an adaptive way across a wide range of learners. Our team will develop AWARE using a scientifically-based methodology that leverages best practices from the psychology of motivation and engagement. AWARE will enable a data-driven, competency-centric learning lifecycle by analyzing user interaction data, generating performance metrics, and presenting the users performance in a gameful simulation environment."

        "abstract": "While the resilience of Navy systems to cyber attacks is critically important, cybersecurity is still frequently bolted-on to deployed systems and is rarely built-in during the early design stages. Bolted-on security is costly and not as effective as building it in from the start. Current approaches for assessing security during the design stage tend to be manual, which is slow, expensive, and can also lead to conflicting recommendations. Tools in this space often provide qualitative results and struggle with a lack of detailed information that is often not available during the system design stage. Cybersecurity Assessment and Risk Enumeration for Systems (CARES) will provide a means for modeling systems during the early design stages. It will use systemic functional grammars to provide an expressive, scalable enumeration of the entire attack space. It will automatically produce a quantitative list of security vulnerabilities for the target system and provide a list of consistent recommendations for remediating the vulnerabilities, while taking into account the other needs of the system and designers, such as performance and cost."

In this proposal, InfoBeyond advocates Multilevel Quantitative Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Using Bayesian Attack Graph (MQCRA) system to address this challenge. MQCRA automatically collect the cybersecurity data and generates the attack graph of the NCS system that represents the dependencies, relations and transition states between vulnerability and exploits as attack paths and computes the exploitation likelihood using Bayesian theory. Also, multiple risk metrics on different levels are designed to quantitatively assess the cybersecurity risk of the NCS regarding vulnerability exploitation possibility, mission impacts, cost, and recommended solutions, etc.. MQCRA enables quantitative risk assessment of an NCS system in the early design stage with following capabilities: (i) Automatic cybersecurity data collection and aggregation. (ii) Bayesian attack graph to generate\/update attack paths, exploitation likelihoods, and risk metrics based on current\/new arrival information, and (iii) Multilevel risk evaluation for full security risk awareness on different levels and user-friendly visualization to support decision-making in the early design stage."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for a secure and reliable wireless network without electromagnetic interference (EMI), Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISS) proposes to develop a new Secure EMI-free Light Communication (SELICOM) system. It is based on a novel design of the Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) attocell that utilizes results of the latest research in light modulation and state-of-the-art development of solid-state devices. Specifically, the innovation in using multi-wavelength LEDs integrated in an optimized transceiver design, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation, and enhanced security features will enable the wireless network in the undersea platform to deliver high-bandwidth communication with increased security, improved reliability, and without interference. As a result, this technology provides up to 3.4 Gbps data bandwidth per attocell, eliminates EMI, and enables creation of a scalable wireless network that offers multiple levels of security through geofencing, restricted use of wavelengths, and line-of-sight connections. In Phase I, ISS will develop a concept of a Li-Fi communications system, demonstrate its feasibility by exceeding 1 GbE cable speed, and prepare a plan for Phase II prototype development. In Phase II, ISS plans to develop and deliver a system prototype capable of transmitting data between a Li-Fi attocell and computers with performance superior to Wi-Fi."

        "abstract": "SA-LiFi is an optical local wireless networking system under development that will distribute broadband data wirelessly over visible and infrared wavelengths, using a store-and-repeat architecture to extend its range. My modulating visbile LED light sources, SA-LiFi exploits the already-available power and line-of-sight to end user devices to upgrade wireless data availability with minimal additions to existing power and data cabling. SA-LiFi end user devices access the network either through USB-attached user devices or by replacing the end-user device&apos;s camera with a SA-LiFi interface with the same form factor. Since the camera slot on the device is naturally oriented toward local lighting, this gives optimal connection to the network, with minimal need for hardware modification. Thus, a wide range of user devices from laptop computers to smartphones can access SA-LiFi. High-level electromagnetic interference, as is present in RF-enclosed spaces such as aircraft cabins and submarines, can interfere with RF-based wireless data systems, yet has no impact on SA-LiFi network availability. SA-LiFi offers a path to high bandwidth and ubiquitous, reliable mobile data for these environments."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in free space optical (FSO) technologies promise a new way to provide energy efficient, high speed, and secure wireless communications. Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) are now sufficiently mature that it is possible to transmit data at high bit rates reliably using simple energy efficient modulation schemes. Also, FSO and RF devices can operate in the same locations without interference. Importantly, FSO transmissions can be made to directly focus to a particular receiver. Consequently, information leak to the surrounding by FSO transmissions can be tightly controlled by adjusting the focus area which is not easily done with typical RF transmissions. FSO devices are also resilient to jamming attack since the attacker has to be in vicinity of the legitimate user and has sufficient power to direct its light to disrupt the receivers signal. This proposal aims to build the first high speed (Gbps), scalable, secure, wireless local area network (WLAN) for undersea platform using an innovative concept called dynamic FSO femtocell (DFF) architecture. DFF technologies provide the coverage area through a network of collaborative femtocells, each can be can be dynamically enlarged, reduced, and moved in such a way to optimize for throughput, energy, security, and mobility."

        "abstract": "Today, the Marine Corp Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) utilizes multiple communication systems in environments that require covert communications and are exposed to severe interference. To provide significantly improved LPI\/LPD (Low-probability of Interference\/Low-probability of detection) we propose an add-on MIMO module that connects to the antenna port of the existing tactical radio, specifically the AN\/PRC-117G. Control of the tactical radio is done via Ethernet to coordinate the tactical radio and add-on module for setup to insure proper configuration, such as carrier frequency and waveform selection.The add-on MIMO module is completely autonomous in operation of the modem and thus does not violate RED\/BLACK isolation requirements imposed within the tactical radio. The MIMO (Multipole Input Multiple Output) technology can be added to these existing radios without any modifications to it. The MIMO module improves the existing tactical radio allowing it to still communicate with existing tactical radios but with advanced beamforming capabilities. When connecting to another tactical radio with add-on MIMO module, the radio can support significantly improved LPI\/LPD capability by spreading the waveform up to a 2 GHz bandwidth."

This is accomplished through a novel A2 system design which provides a long-range, terrestrial, tactical data link and interfaces to the data port(s) of the AN\/PRC-117G. The unique hardware and signal processing design provides precise beam alignment, advanced null-steering towards in-band and adjacent channel interference, power control to enable LPI\/LPD operation, sensing of the surrounding spectral environment and a low-size, weight and power (SWaP), man-packable form factor. This development provides a communication system which can operate with resilience in a contested-network environment. The primary development efforts consist of system feasibility studies, hardware design and development and signaling processing\/software development and evaluation. The developed A2 system is expected to possess TRL 3 at the end of the Phase I effort and TRL 6 at the end of the Phase II effort. GIRDs assembled team brings decades of tactical radio and communication system design experience and is well-qualified to successfully execute this program."

TA systems are constructed of multiple layers of glass laminated together with a spall liner to protect the occupants inside the vehicle. Existing TA designs are experiencing early-life delamination and creating a significant cost and maintenance burden on the Marine Corps. New adhesive sealant chemistries are necessary to improve the environmental durability of the TA armor stacks to reduce delamination propensity and increase service life. Luna is developing an advanced quick-cure potting sealant to provide a consistent, chemically stable, and low off-gassing bond between the TA stack and the metallic frames they are inserted into for vehicle mounting. The new potting sealant will be more environmentally stable and chemically compatible with existing urethane adhesives that are common to TA laminating processes. This will result in greater long-term TA laminate bond strength, resulting in longer service life compared to existing sealant technology. A combination of unique TA coupon test design and accelerated environmental exposure testing will aid in rapid development of the sealant and demonstration of improved service life."

To validate life extension JNI Armor and Applied Physical Sciences Corp will then develop an accelerated test method focusing on high temperature and moisture. Then with support from the test capabilities of Southwest Research Institute, the team will test standard laminates and RF laminates to the accelerated test protocol.

The proposal includes research related to the magnetic fields being attenuated from the magnetic permeability properties of alloys that are applied to the couplers chassis. The use of one or more foils, sheets, or electroplated nanocrystalline ferro-magnetic metal coatings is included in the study. The proposed coupler will provide repeatable measurement and will enable the mast testing of a variety of antenna mast configurations in a laboratory or on a submarine. The coupler will ensure that any existing electromagnetic signals that are generated from local extraneous sources will not interfere with the antenna mast under test. The coupler shall enable the Navys radiated, end-to-end testing and calibration routines to be promptly performed using significantly less labor. The grooming procedures related to a diverse set of submarine masts configurations will become highly repeatable and easier to perform."

To meet this need, we propose to develop an advanced Raman spectrographic system that will detect, identify and accurately measure much lower trace-level chemicals than current systems and provide measurements and readouts in real time. The system will also be programmable, so it can be easily adjusted through software changes to enable identification of a wide variety of future target chemicals of interest. The small, compact technology being used is highly durable, requiring only minimal, inexpensive maintenance, and the system will be easily integrated into existing onboard spaces. The Phase I project will develop a detailed system design and provide a comprehensive proof of concept through performance tests and demonstrations of all critical sensor components. The resulting system will bring submarine atmosphere monitoring to the state of the art and provide the technology needed to support many other important military, government and commercial sensor requirements."

While the CAMS has been updated slightly, there are lingering unresolvable issues. The proposed sensor is based on two different methods that will be incorporated into a single instrument. The first uses an optical path length enhancement approach coupled with laser diodes. It allows the instrument to be rugged and compact without compromising sensitivity at ppm levels. A second method utilizes a photoacoustic cell coupled with laser diodes to detect those specific gases where much lower ppb levels are required. The proposed sensor has the ability to measure concentrations of multiple gases at high sensitivities and includes the ability to accommodate many additional gases as they are identified. The proposed sensor is compact, has a startup time of around 2 minutes and a display update time of one second. The sensor maintenance cost would be far less than that of a mass spectrometer, as the proposed sensor approach has demonstrated the capability to provide accurate measurements for many years without calibration or overhaul."

In addition to monitoring conventional Navy VOCs, the open-path method will enable the rapid, sensitive measurement of highly reactive and adsorbent VOCs (acrolein, formaldehyde, and ozone). In Phase I, we will fabricate an open-path iCRDS system that employs a widely-tunable quantum cascade laser to provide highly sensitive absorption measurements in the mid-infrared. A refined chemometrics package will be developed to analyze the measured absorption spectra and determine VOC concentrations. Finally, the system will be extensively tested on both stable, Navy-relevant compounds, as well as highly reactive and adsorbent species. During the Phase I Option period, we will design a comprehensive Phase II system, including miniaturized hardware for integration into the Central Atmosphere Monitor System (CAMS). During Phase II, we will deliver two systems to the Navy for VOC monitoring. The first will integrate into the CAMS rack for centralized monitoring adjacent to the mass spectrometer. The second will be packaged for distributed monitoring throughout the submarine. This combination will address both current and future Navy needs."

However, the high cost of repair and the lack of field serviceability are drawbacks to this technique. Vescent Photonics proposes to design a dual comb spectrometer in the mid-infrared (3-12 m) wavelength region as an alternative atmospheric monitoring system. Dual comb spectroscopy can achieve high signal to noise in short acquisition times over a wide optical spectrum, enabling simultaneous concentration measurements of multiple gas species in submarine atmospheres. Vescent will refine its near-infrared (1-2 m) frequency comb technology for use at mid-infrared wavelengths, allowing highly sensitive detection of molecular spectral fingerprints for identification of gas constituents and the measurement of their concentrations. Vescents optical frequency comb technology is based on high reliability fiber optic components from the telecommunications industry, reducing the frequency and cost of maintenance of the proposed monitoring system."

However, the rapidly relocatable window, operating at 1 kHz frame rates, makes it suitable for Hostile Fire Indicate (HFI) and threat warning applications, which are typically addressed with much higher SWaP-C cameras. LC-MWIR features a highly innovative readout integrated circuit (ROIC) that enables the demanding performance and SWaP-C requirements to be met.

The concept design will be matured through a process that includes an architecture trade study, model-based engineering (MBE), performance model showing pintle position and chamber pressure to provide the requisite thrust versus time profile, and key tests. The process is structured with the aim of reducing risk on a future Phase II development effort. We will identify the technical risks and develop mitigation plans that can be used to define Phase II scope. VTS will work with Navy SSP to establish all necessary technical requirements. VTS will leverage thermal-management design techniques developed on previous DOD proportional thruster contracts to achieve operation for 1,000 seconds with 3,000 Fahrenheit gas temperature. The concept design will be evaluated for deign margins by performing preliminary thermos-structural analyses of the MBE-generated design."

The hybrid composite, with a target density of 0.05 g\/cm3, will combine the compressive strength and stiffness of macrospheres with the resilience of a blown foam to meet the specified threshold performance properties. The macrospheres will be manufactured using thin film UV-curable core-shell rubber modified vinyl ester technology for damage tolerance, with milled carbon fiber reinforcement. These will be closely packed in highly ordered binary arrays using additive layering techniques for maximum volume packing factor in virtually net shapes. The macrospheres will be encapsulated with carbon reinforced rigid poly-DCPD, polyurethane or BPA\/BPF epoxy blown foam as a binder, engineered for high modulus and resilience in the ocean temperature range. Phase I will develop macrosphere manufacturing, grading and assembly processes and blown foam formulation, resulting in a laboratory-scale composite for property testing. Phase I Option will work on refining properties and scaling up processes for full-scale production in a Phase II. Potential technology offshoots include a high-performance syntactic foam with unprecedented strength and moduli for given density, as well as a pure blown foam of high stiffness and resilience for shallow water."

Hollow spheres from the set of adequate materials will be modeled using thin wall pressure vessel theory. Amorphous glass foam simulation will be performed using the finite element method. Finally, material production scalability and cost will be discussed. All data will be compiled into a final report describing the concept for producing the buoyancy material with the accompanying analyses to prove sufficient performance. During the option period, a hollow sphere deposition concept for additive manufacturing will be mathematically analyzed and designed. The necessary hardware and software components will be selected and the entire apparatus drafted into engineering drawings. At the end of the option period, Phase II plans for constructing the apparatus will be detailed."

        "abstract": "Industrial control systems (ICS) are the nervous systems of modern day ships, controlling the engines, power generation and distribution, ballasts, and other key systems. Unfortunately these ICS networks are all too often insecure by design and completely ignored by network monitoring and intrusion detection systems. Current ICS network security products offer little more than basic monitoring and shallow intrusion detection, failing to detect skilled nation-state level adversaries or provide any real day-to-day value for operations. The proposed project will address this unmet need by building an ICS network monitoring solution anchored around two patent-pending advanced intrusion detection techniques and supported by new passive machine learning techniques. The first technology fingerprints actuators based on their physical operation time, helping to detect false data injection and equipment malfunctions. The second technology monitors controller program execution time for anomalies and alerts when the programming has been altered. And finally, the new machine learning techniques will combine aspects of both cyber and physical behavior of ICS network nodes and alert on anomalous behavior. A basic prototype will be evaluated on a mock-up testbed of a Navy ship&apos;s engine cooling system to prove feasibility and enable accurate design specifications for future development."

The Platform conducts comparative analysis and change detection on the raw signals of an ICS, which enables the Platform to monitor ICS networks and identify traffic that identifies anomalous activity both on the ICS network and at the specific control devices. In STTR N16A-T013, Cyber Forensic Tool Kit for Machinery Control, MSi proved the ability to apply the Platform within the existing infrastructure to provide full system visibility and monitoring of ICS network traffic. The MSi EagleEye Platform effectively sensorizes the ICS digital, serial and analog network, and that full system awareness can enable a predictive maintenance application, which is anticipated to save the Navy 25% - 30% on annual maintenance costs. The MSi Platform is commercially deployed to DoD UAV systems, hardened avionics, oil &amp; gas customers, electrical generation and distribution utilities, building\/facility ICS, and automated traffic systems. With the previous STTR completed, MSi offers to deliver a shipboard prototype within 12 months of initial SBIR Phase I award, provided a Phase II is also awarded."

        "abstract": "As the Anti-submarine warfare (ASuW) and anti-air warfare (AAW) threats become more sophisticated, it is important for the surveillance and tracking algorithms to be able to detect and track these threats in the presence of heavy sea clutter. A fundamental problem is that accurate models of the environment and radar\/IR returns are needed in order for the algorithms to be trained and validated. The underlining problem involves both hydrodynamics and electromagnetic (EM) simulations, and the overall problem is multi-scale, electrically large, and complex. There is a critical need to improve the fidelity of modeling the returns from sea clutter without sacrificing the real-time capability."

        "abstract": "Present-day Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS) ships perform detection and classification operations, including the computationally expensive task of processing collected data. Since greater computing is available at on-shore processing stations, improved target detection and localization are possible if the terrestrial stations perform the processing. However, the large volume of data requires large communications bandwidth between the ship and shore. If this data volume can be reduced, then the shore facilities can take on increased processing, reducing the need for costly custom hardware on the ship.Metron proposes an innovative, physics-based data compression approach that transforms hydrophone data into a related mathematical matrix space that possesses structure related to ambient noise and any acoustic sources, allowing improved communications. The approach allocates bits to represent the transformed signals more efficiently than traditional linear methods and preserves nearly full-fidelity data representation with fewer bits. By reducing the number of bits needed to represent the data, the proposed bit-allocation approach will in turn reduce the number of bits needed to transmit the signals from SURTASS vessels to shore for processing and analysis. Preliminary testing on real, unclassified data already achieves significant compression, and thus provides a promising foundation for continued research."

        "abstract": "Navys ship-to-shore cargo transfer operations, supported by the INLS, is largely dependent on local wave characteristics for decision making and throughput planning. In this proposal, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI), along with its subcontractor Lockheed Martin (LM), propose to develop a Wave Characteristics Measurement System (WCMS) based on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm to estimate the wave characteristics in real time only using warping tug motions as input. The proposed deep learning architecture combines a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks together. This combined structure makes it possible to learn the composition of physical system and noise model directly from noisy sensor data. Deep neural networks need large amount of data to train. In this project, we propose to develop high-fidelity ship motion simulation software to generate large amounts of data for training and evaluation. The proposed approach is built on top of IAIs previous success and experience with deep learning predictive analytics and ship motion simulation, prediction and control demonstrated in various ONR, DARPA and AFRL programs."

        "abstract": "Thermal batteries are single discharge reserve batteries that provide very long shelf life, minimal self-discharge, wide storage temperature range, fast activation under sudden power demand, and also wide range of temperature operating conditions. Such unique properties among electrochemical power systems are provided with application of molten salt electrolyte, which is in solid form under normal storage conditions. Upon activation, thermal batteries are heated with an internal pyrotechnic heat charge above melting temperature of the molten salt electrolyte. This allows for fast ion mobility and facilitates charge transfer reaction. Due to the unique properties, thermal batteries are primarily used in DoD applications, specifically in munitions and weapon systems. Modern applications and their latest development call for high performance advanced thermal batteries. We are proposing development, demonstration, and characterization of a long-activated life, safe, and cost efficient thermal battery. The proposed solution addresses significant market segment of submarine-launched ballistic missiles and other munitions of projected fast market growth. Along with the proposed development in Phase I and Phase II, we will aim for fully functional prototypes and field tries. The technology will be actively marketed to DoD agencies."

It enables a high-level system function to meet specified radiation requirements even though certain lower level subsystem functions are implemented with components having lower hardness levels. A typical C&amp;R scheme may involve the use of a high-performance central processor unit (CPU) that does not meet the system level radiation requirements for upset, or even latch-up, threshold, but is provided rapid and orderly error handling, fault isolation, and power-down\/reset functions that are managed by upper radiation-hardened parts. Established concepts for C&amp;R and their hardware implementations have not kept paced with advances in semiconductor technology. We are proposing a comprehensive effort to modernize the C&amp;R paradigm for hardening advanced electronics technologies to nuclear radiation-induced upset."

High voltage safe and arm (S&amp;A) firing switches are critical components within the EFI. Using higher voltage and higher current capability switches is beneficial for improved EFI efficiency. Due to the critical nature of the S&amp;A firing switches, they must be able to function reliably in radiation environments and high temperatures. Use of devices that are fundamentally tolerant to the naturally occurring radiation and temperature environmental conditions can eliminate or reduce the need for shielding and temperature control systems. Therefore using radiation hardened high voltage switches is beneficial for the development of high efficiency and high reliability EFI. During this program, United Silicon Carbide will extend the capability of its SiC JFET power switch technology to produce high pulse current capable, high voltage, radiation hard, high-temperature capable Silicon Carbide (SiC) Junction Field Effect Transistor (JFET) cascode switch suitable for EFI applications. The switch would be compatible with natural space radiation environment, and would be able to survive through radiation pulses induced by strategic nuclear events."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the need for innovative algorithms that convert acoustic time-domain data into a compressed data stream that is transmitted via satellite communications (SATCOM) and reassembled with low latency upon its receipt. The Navy requires 100% preservation of the acoustic data to be transmitted in real-time for processing at shore facilities. drivewarps novel approach involves genetic and machine learning algorithms combined with a proprietary reference data block library that disassembles and reassembles data in real-time. Dynamic data replication (DDRep) technology replaces the original data with assembly instructions (metadata) and reference data blocks stored on both the sending and receiving device. The metadata can be transmitted and then stored until needed, and the audio files reassembled at that time. drivewarps state-of-the-art technology significantly reduces bandwidth and storage requirements and allows reference data sets to be stored separately from the metadata, enabling a high degree of security. DDRep can be used on any networked device for real-time data reduction and transmission and would decrease the Navys deployment costs by enabling the use of an inexpensive unmanned vessel to collect acoustic data, saving $50k-100k per day for the DoN."

In order for this transmission to be viable, a near-lossless compression codec must be designed to meet at least a 5-to-1 compression ratio in real-time. This 5-to-1 compression ratio will be a starting place for transmitting time-domain data from SURTASS ASW towed arrays for phase I, as the focus of this SBIR is to maximize the compression ratio, while staying within the bounds of processing power and signal integrity. With this SBIR, the ASSETT team will bring extensive knowledge of ambient ocean noise leveraged from previous contract work, as well as the in-depth knowledge of compression theory and SURTASS ASW software from L3 Adaptive Methods. The ASSETT team will develop 4 principle methods that will additively combine to create a codec that meets and exceeds the compression ratio goal while meeting any other requirements on processing power, signal integrity, and latency: Statistical redundancy in the K-Omega domains acoustic zone, Multi-dimensional linear predictive filters, Lossy compression of unimportant data in the K-Omega domains non-acoustic zone, and multi-dimensional entropy encoding."

        "abstract": "We propose a modular approach to compressing multi-channel acoustic time domain data. Our approach applies advanced multi-resolution denoising and outlier removal methods, for each channel, followed by an up-to-lag similarity cross-correlation and dynamic time warping based comparison step between the recovered waveforms, which would potentially decrease the amount of retained waveforms compared to the number of channels, replacing many by associated time lag and differencing information with respect to a set of pillars. Following this, a suitable transformation will be applied to each retained time domain waveform (to make the data amenable to lossless compression) and Burrows-Wheeler type compression, together with Arithmetic coding as the entropy encoder would be employed to achieve desirable compression ratio over the whole data set. This will be an improvement on the standard bzip2 like compressor (typically ranked as one of the best all-around lossless compression tools), which by default uses Huffman coding as the entropy encoder. A suitable decoding implementation will be built to deconstruct the waveforms for each channel. More advanced denoising methods utilizing machine learning will be experimented with. Our preliminary implementation indicates that 10x near lossless compression ratio is attainable."

Because 1D-SPIHT has low complexity in addition to high efficiency, the coding-decoding latency is almost negligible. .Also proposed for testing is a two-dimensional SPIHT coder for inter-channel compression, if separate channel data are made available.

A solution to this problem is needed to get ahead of the curve for the future fleet operations. There is an opportunity to develop new ablative materials for the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) with the same form, fit, and function of the current ablative material that extends the service life by decreasing the erosion rate. Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc., (TRI Austin) proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a new ablative material that demonstrates similar material properties and half of the erosion rate of the current MXB-360 material. The materials will be tested with a solid rocket motor with aluminized propellant to evaluate relative erosion rates vs. material costs per pound. The thermal and physical properties of the new materials will be compared to MXB-360."

The SVACS innovation will solve the issues of straightness, verticality and orientation without requiring expensive redesign of the arrays themselves and can be easily incorporated into the existing and new systems. The novel intermittent operating concept of the SVACS technology will avoid introducing acoustic noise at critical times.The promoted concept consists of thruster modules placed along the length of the array arranged to provide forces capable of restoring the system to vertical and accurately controlling the array shape. In addition to thrusters, each module will include sensors to inform the SVACS software controller. Array shape estimation and control of the thruster modules is recognized by Makai as an important development aspect of the proposed SVACS technology. Makai has unparalleled experience in this field and we will seek to leverage our experience to provide a high fidelity turnkey hydrodynamic control system. The technical objective of the proposed phase I study is to model, design and prove the SVACS concept via robust hydrodynamic modeling, risk reduction experiments and experienced ocean engineering."

Solarno specializes in roll-to-roll manufacturing of self-supporting CNT films. In this project, we will utilize spray-coated Ag nanowires to improve CNT electrodes resistivity and reach target of 10 Ohm\/sq, and optical transmission T=90%. Solarno will work closely with Texas State University to optimize the hybrid organohalide lead perovskite LED devices and characterize perovskite films deposited on various aluminized plastic substrates. During 6 month option period Solarno and TXST will measure lifetime of devices fabricated and investigate scalability and producibility of the fabricated prototype devices."

        "abstract": "Current Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniforms (MCCUU) fabricated with 50:50 nylon:cotton (NYCO) blends are relatively inexpensive, but suffer from significant flammability concerns. Although a flame resistant (FR) version utilizing polyaramid (e.g. Nomex) blends exists, it is significantly more expensive and less durable than the NYCO uniform. There is a desire by the Marine Corps to confer FR properties to all combat uniforms, yet the shift to overseas production of specialty aramid fibers has made this economically impractical. There have been many commercial developments toward the production of less inexpensive FR fabrics with the use of flame retardant additives and coatings. The most cost effective of these FR treatments are based on halogenated chemicals, evolve toxic gases when combusted, and also do not prevent melt\/drip properties of synthetic fabrics under flame conditions. Other flame retardant utilize the heavy incorporation of inorganic fillers, which significantly decrease the flexibility and breathability of the fabric and at the necessary high loadings to achieve FR properties. Lunas approach is to apply an inexpensive, lightweight nanocomposite surface treatment that will promote char formation for enhanced flame protection (decreased flame propagation, eliminate melt\/drip) while maintaining the desired flexibility and comfort for high user acceptability."

        "abstract": "NAWCTSD Battle Lab runs many training and simulation systems to help train Naval war fighters. Each of these independent training systems contains one or more networks across one or more independent domains. Domains are separated by security level: Secret, Unclassified, etc. or by need-to-know or purpose: e.g., navigation, targeting, or simulation control. Each of these networks and domains contain routers, switches, servers, and other devices that need to be configured and managed in a centralized way, blocked by legitimate cross domain security concerns. A tool is needed to help manage all these systems and networks from a centralized console or network. This is difficult because of the cross-domain nature of these independent control networks spread across multiple security domains and purposes. ATCorp is proposing CNA, a Cross Domain Network Administration tool. CNA will allow these isolated networks to connect to a centralized Network Administration tool through Cross-domain Guards (CDS) to provide the missing centralized control. The devices in these networks that need to be controlled centrally include: routers, firewalls, switches (VLANs, SDN-Software Defined Networks, NaaSNetwork as a service), servers (DNS, DHCP, time server, file server, etc.), and others."

        "abstract": "Submarines have many computer applications and systems to monitor real-time operational status of the mechanical systems onboard. These applications are classified at different levels and are spread across subnets in multiple security domains. The mixed domain nature of submarine networks forces applications that should operate at lower security levels to operate at higher security levels. This complicates the applications and operations, requiring slow Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) which add latency, limitations and data restrictions that can lead to redundant applications at different security levels and work arounds that can leak data. As the next-generation submarine is being designed, a new way for running cross-domain applications is being sought. Applications need to operate at lower levels, with ability to work with data from higher and lower levels. This new data filter system needs to be a secure, more dynamic CDS. ATCorp is proposing the Adaptive Cross-Domain Enabling System or ACES to meet these goals. ACES will improve overall application performance of real-time control systems for the submarine mechanical and network systems. The ACES system is applicable to other systems like navigation and weapons, and for tactical networks that combine sea, air and land network assets."

As information networks become more integral to immediate decisions, the tried and true method of manual inspection of all information crossing security boundaries becomes ineffective. The proposal being put forth outlines an effective automated mechanism which combines a hardware appliance with implanted software guards to protect both the sending and receiving domain from cross contamination. Two major concepts are to be explored within this research effort. The first concept creates specific software protocols that will be used in support of Navy Strategic Systems Program (SSP) identified needs. The second concept focuses on practical methods to determine if the protocols created are operationally correct, and most importantly that the developed mechanisms are immune to covert channel vulnerabilities. These concepts will work in concert with the proposed hardware to create a technology solution that addresses this important need while still meeting NSA information assurance requirements."

The AtF is able to tune to an interfering frequency in less than 100 nanoseconds and provide a 20dB+ notch filter response with Q in the 100-1000 range.AtFs are analog devices that provide Signal Processing capability at RF without power, control circuitry or software and can significantly reduce the complexity of complementary Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and coordination techniques in both direct staring and superheterodyne broadband receivers. Any number of discrete notches can be simultaneously generated in a single AtF device. Minimal modification to the ESM architecture is needed since the signal processing occurs in real-time. The AtF can enable ESM to continue over a large bandwidth at the same time as other onboard emitters are transmitting."

Our baseline design employs an innovative analog RF Hybrid Adaptive Canceller (RFHAC) cascaded with a Digital Signal Processing Canceller (DSPC) capability, along with coordination and synchronization features that maximize ESM system probability of intercept while minimizing impact to RADAR missions and other interferer functionality.With Azure Summits Switchblade tuner being one of the primary ESM tuner targets on Triton, EP-3 and P-8 platforms, we have the unique ability to bring value to this solution space. Specifically, without impacting existing onboard ESM capability, we can implement digital cancellation techniques for those ESM personalities as well as provide real-time tuner information to the radar system and receive real-time radar information to affect coordination between the systems."

Additionally, with respect to life management and maintenance, and repair and overhaul (MRO) activities. This approach results in multiplicity of data, some contradictory data, and incomplete data. An efficient Web-Based platform is needed with a reasoning engine that interfaces with aircraft and external data systems, provides current diagnostic state of the aircraft and is able to make component life predictions.Over the last 15 years, TDA developed an expertise in fleet tracking and fatigue life monitoring to implement state-of-the-art algorithm for computation of parameters that properly describe the usage and health status of each single component for both fixed and rotor wing aircraft. TDA will leverage this experience and the ACTS (Aircraft Component Tracking System) platform currently deployed for the H-60 to provide a solution in the Big Data framework that will enable US Navy personnel to efficiently, securely and almost in real-time access the tracking information about the status of their rotorcraft fleet. The platform will be designed to be resilient to both data and processing faults, easily scalable and based on modular, user-friendly, highly-customizable applications."

However, considering technical challenges in maintenance protocols and relatively high fuel displacement\/retention volume percentages coming along with current material solutions, the target application segment requires lightweight and high-performance innovative explosion suppression materials that can ensure reliable long-term use. Digital Materials LLC will develop a novel low-density foam material technology which acts as a heat sink to remove energy during the explosion, mechanically interferes with the flame preceding waves owing to the enhanced surface area, and controls vapor mixture in ullage space having fuel droplets to coalesce through superoleophilic surface characteristic. During Phase I period, Digital Materials LLC will demonstrate the technical feasibility of this foam material via experimental characterization of critical physical properties on the proof-of-concept scale samples. A scalable foam fabrication process will be concurrently designed and developed to produce sub-scale size foam specimens with experimentally validated material performance. Upon successful demonstration, this material may qualify for the airborne military use to be installed in new fuel tanks or retrofitted in existing fuel tanks with ease and reliability."

Current ESF materials have a several practical limitations. Routine maintenance of fuel tanks requires that the ESF be removed until maintenance is complete and then reinstalled in the fuel tank. ESF is often difficult to remove and reinstall, increasing the amount of time required for routine repairs and time out of service for the air vehicle. The second limitation has to do with the density and volume of ESF. The nominal density of ESF is 1.3 pounds per cubic feet. At this density the ESF displaces up to 2.5 percent of the fuel by volume and retains up to 2.5 percent of the fuel by volume. An innovative FTES material is needed to replace ESF, while still meeting the same explosion suppression performance properties. The requirements for the improved ESF are a nominal density of = 0.9 pounds per cubic feet, fuel displacement = 1% fuel volume and fuel retention = 1% fuel volume.

        "abstract": "The objective of Topic N182-121 is to develop a low-density and low-volume explosion suppression material for aircraft fuel tanks. Explosion Suppression Foam (ESF) is used as a passive means to improve safety and mitigate ballistically-induced events and\/or electrical failures that can propagate flame fronts within fuel tanks aboard naval air and land vehicles. Despite the benefits from ESF, fuel tanks aboard aircraft and vehicles require routine maintenance, and removing and reinstalling ESF is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Furthermore, at a nominal density of 1.3 pounds per cubic feet, the ESF displaces a measurable amount of fuel volume. This program will address the development of a new fuel tank explosion suppression (FTES) material with a density less than 0.9 pounds per cubic foot, that is compatible with JP-4, JP-5, JP-8 and commercial Jet A fuels, including strict adherence to SAE AIR 4170B. METSS will engineer the alternative ESF using novel materials to meet targeted physical, mechanical, and performance properties required to protect the foam. METSS will leverage historical expertise in fuel bladder survivability to address the concerns of the solicitation."

Corvids design approach will utilize topology optimization to generate an initial distribution of material in the component design. Using the material distribution obtained for the topology optimized component, lattice with same corresponding mechanical properties will be seeded into the computational domain. In order to bridge the multiple scales of the lattice structures, a second round of topology optimization will be performed only at the boundary of the lattice unit cells. This will yield a continuous internal structure utilizing multiple scales of lattice structures to achieve both structural and mass efficiency."

        "abstract": "With the advent of additive manufacturing (AM), lattice structures are being deployed today in a variety of engineering applications where light-weight, large surface area, energy absorption, etc., are critical. However, the design and fabrication of such lattice structures poses several challenges. From a design perspective, current methods are computationally prohibitive, or require artificial constraints that significantly reduce the design space. Furthermore, it has been observed that the resulting lattice structures are sub-optimal when compared to non-lattice-structure designs obtained through classic macro-scale optimization. From a manufacturing perspective, incorporating process constraints and accounting for lower-than-nominal structural performances into the design process has also been elusive.TDAs proposed work addresses the SBIR topic objectives of developing an intelligent framework to design and analyze scalable lattice architectures for missile applications. Based on our teams expertise in topology optimization, modeling for AM process and nondestructive testing, our approach consists of: (1) extend in-house conforming lattice structure optimization to include stress constraints under static and dynamic loading, (2) address process-related challenges of manufacturing, (3) use predictive modeling of lattice structure behavior under all loading to determine a statistical basis of failure propagation and risk-based decision and (4) perform experimental testing and validation using Digital Image Correlation."

This tool will provide the Navy with a means of utilizing high fidelity performance characterization data for accelerated design validation with automated data processing and finite element modeling correction for application in current and next-generation weapon systems. CRG will develop a design and analysis methodology along with an accompanying design tool for automated utilization of empirical performance data alongside finite element predictions to quantify response uncertainties and guide subsequent design adjustments. In addition to facilitating component design refinement, the computational framework will also extract features from the full field characterization data for identification of qualification signatures for detection of manufacturing defects in production settings. During the Phase I effort, CRG will demonstrate the feasibility of correlated additive feedback for optimized cellular structures by applying the developed methodology to a design space and modeling specification for a structural missile component and performing experimental full field testing on sub-scale optimized benchmark structures."

Materials Sciences Corporation (MSC) has developed and demonstrated the design and analysis tools needed to optimize cellular (lattice) structures that exploit state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and tailor the frequency response of missile components and associated structures while minimizing weight. Despite these advances, considerable research is required to develop robust structural components for missile structures. In particular, optimization of the strength of cellular structures and verification of their performance via experiments is needed. In response to this need, the proposed research will focus on development of an integrated framework of design, analysis, and test and evaluation methodologies to design structural components using a lattice (cellular) design. Particular attention will be paid to optimization of unit cell architectures and lattice networks for strength, e.g., local yielding, local buckling, global buckling, etc. The result of this research will be a modeling framework of design and analysis for the development of scalable lattice (or cellular) architectures to optimize the weight, dynamic response and robustness of structural components for missile applications."

        "abstract": "Naval aircraft often are subject to electromagnetic interference (EMI) due to external radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic effects (EME) with field strengths in excess of 12,000 V\/m generated by radars operating at 400 MHz and above. They are also subject to generally less intense fields produced by internal or external sources such as handheld radios and antennas mounted to the aircraft. This EMI may adversely affect the aircrafts communication, navigation, and sensing systems. To quantitatively assess this vulnerability, simulation frameworks aimed at characterizing EMI inside loaded airframes subject to excitation and geometric uncertainties are necessary. Under this proposed effort, EMA will develop a multi-fidelity simulation framework (including a transfer impedance database) aimed at characterizing EMI in aircraft replete with navigation, communication, and sensing systems subject to excitation and geometric uncertainties. The experience gained and software developed over the past 40 years from EMA staff solving challenging HIRF, lightning and EMP problems will be heavily leveraged under this effort. The proposed framework is anticipated to permit the characterization of EMI in realistically modeled airframes up to 18 GHz by the completion of the Phase I effort."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for a sensor capable of detecting cracks in propellant grain and transmitting the sensor data wirelessly through a hermetically sealed rocket motor case, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISI) proposes to develop a new Propellant Health Monitoring (PHEM) system, based on the novel integration of ultrasonic transducers as both signal generator and sensor with ultralow-power components and electronic design. Specifically, this unique integration of ultrasonic propellant-monitoring sensor and data transfer links enables PHEM to detect cracks and transfer the sensor data by telemetry through the metal walls of the sealed rocket motor case. Novel implementation of the piezoelectric sensors and actuators, low-power electronics, and supercapacitor technology supports &gt;10 years of operation life. As a result, the PHEM system will provide reliable, long-term monitoring for the propellant-actuated devices on military aircraft. In Phase I, ISI will demonstrate the feasibility of the PHEM system by designing and fabricating a laboratory-scale prototype and demonstrating its ability to detect propellant grain cracks inside a hermetically sealed metal case and transmit the data. In Phase II, ISI plans to refine and optimize the PHEM system, develop a fully functional prototype, and demonstrate its compliance with Navy requirements."

In Phase I, ROI will design, assemble, and produce a working prototype of the FAULT SHM sensor network and test it on a simulated Navy canopy rocket motor structure to demonstrate its ability to detect and localized hidden cracks within the propellant grain structural. In Phase II, ROI will produce a stand-alone FAULT SHM sensor network system and tested in the MK 109 Canopy Jettison Rocket under a variety of static and dynamic test conditions. All of the Navy current and future operational PADs and CADs platforms will benefit significantly from this project, wherein the key technological challenge is to develop methodologies for high fidelity detection and characterization of flaws and degradation in complex structures."

Wireless solutions include leveraging standards found in wireless Internet-of-Things devices. However, congestion in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands also may impact data collection. Innoflight proposes to develop a very low SWaP WAIC-based wireless system for flight test instrumentation based on its NASA-ARC SBIR 2016 Phase I, Wireless Sensor Piconet Radio (WiSPiR), a.k.a., whisper."

NextGen team proposes to develop flexible hybrid sensory systems by adapting emerging technologies to bridge the gaps in SOTA solutions and implementation requirements. NextGen will identify candidate wireless protocols and select the one suitable for missile applications, select feasible solutions that satisfy requirements, and compare selected solutions with COTS solutions in Phase I. We are proposing hybrid sensory systems to be built on NextGen teams extensive knowledge and experience of printed multiplexed sensors and associated electronics technologies and a series of legacy programs developing wireless sensor technologies. NextGen goal is to produce prototype sensory system to be evaluated by Navy within three years.

        "abstract": "Radio Frequency over Fiber (RFoF) is not a new technology, fiber has been used to relay modulated analog signals for many years. The advent of multi-core fibers brings a new paradigm to the application. With the development of multicore fiber, the need for novel, accurate connection technologies has become imperative. The multi-core fiber, with single mode operating wavelengths of 1000nm to 1550nm, enhances emerging RFoF applications and virtually eliminates interference coupling between adjacent RF pathways. Additionally, Fiber Optic (FO) pathways are immune to external Electrical Magnetic Interference (EMI), a constant problem in electrical based RF pathways. Another advantage of RFoF networks is their phase stability. Electrical RF systems require constant attention to maintain phase-coherence due to cable sensitivities, a disadvantyage that RFoF systems do not have. Additionally, losses within the cable plant of an RFoF based system are significantly lower than their electrical cable based counterparts. Wide bandwidth, and low cable weight and size are also benefits that fiber provides over electrical cable based RF networks."

        "abstract": "Fiber optic data links are attractive for their wide bandwidth, low weight, electromagnetic interference immunity and ability to transmit high fidelity analog and digital radio-frequency-over-fiber (RFoF) signals. Multicore fiber (MCF) links will provide even higher capacity and density and enhance dynamic range analog links using parallel fibers of precisely equal length. The need for a high-quality, ruggedized MCF connector, enabling pluggable, high capacity, fiber optic link ports across military platforms, warrants the establishment of a MIL-spec for such a connector.In Phase I, Chiral Photonics, Inc. (CPI), will design an MCF connector that meets the environmental and mechanical requirements for fiber connectors as outlined in MIL-PRF-64266 while addressing repeatability requirements. Leveraging its experience in MCF fanouts and optical fiber connectorization and, in cooperation with a provider of MIL-spec connectors to the U.S. military, CPI will focus on MIL-spec-ready connectors based on commercially available NGCON and MPO connectors. CPI will simulate the performance of the MCF connector, create a prototype and conduct initial repeatability testing. The Phase I effort will enable a path into Phase II where a scalable connector will be constructed and tested and will be the basis for a new MIL-spec , military grade MCF connector."

In Phase I, we will fabricate and test a coupon sized CNT heater. We will work with our CNT manufacturing partner to develop materials with improved optical transparency and reduced sheet resistance.

To mitigate the burnout of the conductive heater layer as the leading cause of aircraft windscreen failures, INTER Materials proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative technology that promises to deposit adherent carbon nanotube conductive films to acrylic substrates to improve their performance without compromising the optical properties of acrylic. The proof-of-concept criteria is for the process to be scalable for full-size aircraft windshields.INTER Materials confidence on the proposed CNT technology is based on our success with developing scratch\/abrasion resistant coating technologies for aircraft windscreens, our access to the state-of-the-art laboratory equipment at Virginia Tech for the characterization of thin films, and our partnership with a well-established and recognized manufacturer of transparencies and canopies for military aircraft. In addition, INTER Materials has the support from Chasm Advanced Materials for the supply of CNT dispersions. Chasm, with volume manufacturing capabilities of customized CNT suspensions\/inks, is recognized worldwide for its expertise in the fields of carbon nanotube synthesis, purification, chiral separation, dispersion, functionalization, and characterization."

        "abstract": "Navy aircraft possess highly sophisticated windshields and window materials that enable superior performance and visibility for pilots and mission operators. Windshields on the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft have recently been found to be susceptible to failure due to burnout of the embedded conductive heater layer. The transparent metallic heater layer is designed to enable deicing via electric\/resistive warming of the windshield surface. Initial observations of the heater failure suggest that the mechanical rigors of flight (vibration, flexing) are causing physical strain on the heater layer which leads to fracture and eventual burnout. Replacement of these failed windshields incurs a significant cost in materials, labor and downtime for the aircraft. The ideal solution would be to improve the flexibility and toughness of the heating layer without sacrificing optical performance. Researchers at Luna have recently developed resistive heaters based carbon nanotubes (CNT) for use as flexible film heaters in composite fabrication and repair applications. In this proposed Phase I SBIR program, Luna will develop a prototype heater film compatible with V-22 windshields that will enable rapid, controlled deicing capability without sacrificing optical performance in the visible and near-IR."

The overall goal of the SBIR program is to develop a usable product with the following characteristics: be 5 W\/in2, bonded to a transparent acrylic substrate, produce even temperatures with a maximum to minimum range of no more than 10 F, remain 90% transparent in the visible and night vision imaging system spectrums, and endure 500 cycles of 2% strain 4-point bending without property degradation. Our approach will yield a TCF capable of conforming to complex geometries, while remaining mechanically robust. For the Phase I effort, Mainstream will experimentally demonstrate feasibility of our technical approach. The focus will be on the light transmittance, heating performance, mechanical flexibility, EMI shielding efficiency, manufacturing cost and commercialization potential. For Phase II, Mainstream will develop prototypes of the windshield. This prototype will demonstrate optical properties tested against heater performance and flexibility. In addition, the Phase II will focus on developing the transition plan and minimizing cost of manufacturing."

We will leverage knowledge from established semiconductor Integrated Circuit (IC) and renewable energy industries including automotive and solar, infuse the relevant subjects with emerging PIC reliability data, and augment remaining gaps with Highly Accelerated Life Test (HALT) methodology. In Phase I, IFOS will establish approaches to model intra-chip PIC reliability and develop experimental test plans based on various degradation phenomena and failure modes. In Phase II, IFOS will populate and validate the reliability prediction models with PIC environmental, electro-optical, and mechanical testing. The reliability models will be implemented in a software toolkit for independent verification. The associated methodology will be subjected to reliability community debate to enable standardization and industry adoption. To accomplish the stated objectives and significantly mitigate program risks, IFOS has assembled a world-class multidisciplinary team of microelectronic and photonic chip-level expertise, together with reliability testing and software toolkit development specialties."

Developing verified and validated reliability models for this emerging technology is critical to establish the confidence necessary for transition and adoption to military applications. DfR Solutions has previously demonstrated the ability to develop reliability physics models, create and execute test plans for model validation, and disseminating this expertise to industry through their Sherlock Automated Design Analysis software. DfR Solutions software development approach to aggregate physics-based reliability predictions from component level through the system level makes reliability physics accessible to engineers and project managers throughout the development process. Other existing software features demonstrate DfR Solutions ability to execute physics-based reliability predictions from engineering data, apply test data modification and organize the results in ways that reduce program cost and timeline.DfR Solutions will leverage these strategies to:-develop reliability physics-based degradation models for PIC and PLC device reliability predictions-create a software tool that automates the reliability predictions and integrates the results with package, board and box-level model predictions-create accelerated life test (ALT) plan for component qualification, verification, and validation"

We will design, fabricate and characterize (phase I) the MZM and the BPD, and develop packaging processes for their integrations with the dual-core MCF. Toward the end of phase I, we will conduct a proof-of-concept demonstration of a high-gain, low noise figure (NF), large spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) intensity modulated direct detection (IMDD) link. We will optimize (phase II) the critical component designs and refine their fabrication and packaging processes for MIL-qualified hermetic component packages that have reduced size, weight and power (SWaP). We will further demonstrate a 45GHz bandwidth, high gain, shot noise limited balanced detection IMDD link using a long, &gt;100m, dual-core MCF. We will apply such a link to RF-over-fiber (RoF) applications and demonstrate &gt;10 gigabits per second data rate. In addition, we will modify our existing high-speed modulator and photodiode designs to scale up the component bandwidth and show a path towards 100GHz link for emerging systems."

        "abstract": "Photonic integration, and specifically silicon photonics, has emerged as one of the leading solutions for maintaining or improving the performance of optical systems while addressing the requirements related to size, weight, and power (SWaP). Photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which integrate multiple photonic elements onto a single chip, are specifically suited to providing the complexity and functionality for the aforementioned optical systems, and therefore, PICs have been getting integrated into optical systems on many platforms including those systems for avionic applications.Evaluating the reliability of emerging technologies is a critical step towards successful transition into military programs. Although much effort has been dedicated to updating existing reliability models for individual photonic devices, the models still do not include methods for predicting the reliability of PICs that include multiple photonic device components on a single chip. The goal of this Phase I effort is to develop methods for understanding and predicting the reliability of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for avionic applications. The AIM Photonics manufacturing platform will serve as a basis for evaluating PIC devices, and the reliability models developed will provide a significant value to a broad community of innovators developing PIC technologies for both military and commercial applications."

        "abstract": "The automated test equipment (ATE) family provides state-of-art testing capabilities for weapons replaceable assemblies across the DoD. However, each ATEs testing capabilities are defined in a proprietary way. The absence of an open and standardized representation limits tool interoperability, makes it more difficult to use COTS automated tools, and can cause confusion in test station instrumentation. The Automated Test System (ATS) Framework Integrated Product Team identified the Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML), an IEEE standard, as a viable language to describe the capabilities of ATSs and test instruments.TSC proposes developing open architecture ATML Toolkit software that can describe ATE capabilities, catalog test instrument features, and display\/report information in a human readable format. The tool will store ATE capabilities in a reconfigurable database determined by the ATE family and its test instruments. From the database, the tool will generate a file adhering to the IEEE 1636 Test Results schema and display its output to a graphical user interface. The tool will be capable of parsing ATML files and augmenting the ATE capabilities database automatically. To aid in adopting ATML standards, TSC will also create a free open-source software tool for creating common signal models and ATML Test Instrument Description files."

        "abstract": "Denial of Global Navigation Satellite Systems for aircraft navigation in a Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) has a significant impact on military missions. To address this, TSC proposes to develop an image-based navigation system that exploits an onboard, forward-looking millimeter wave (W-band) radar. In Phase I, TSC will investigate two different image-based navigation concepts: One will correlate W-band radar images collected in real-time with previous radar scans to correct the drift in the INS solution. The second concept will correlate the W-band images with non-like source, geo-referenced imagery collected using other radar or EO\/IR sensors or digital databases. The Phase I focus will be developing and testing innovative algorithms to automatically establish tie-points between the real-time W-band radar images and reference imagery, and solving for the aircraft position\/attitude. The planned work includes extending a previously developed multi-sensor, rotational- and scale-invariant image registration technique that worked well. TSC will simulate realistic W-band data to evaluate the feature matching and navigation accuracy that can be obtained. In the Option effort, TSC will refine the most promising algorithms and evaluate them over a wider range of conditions. In Phase II, TSC will implement near-real-time processing software and demonstrate the algorithms on measured W-band data."

        "abstract": "The ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispenser Set (CMDS) is installed on almost all Navy aircraft and is a vital component of the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Suite. Each Type\/Model\/Series of aircraft utilizes a Mission Data File (MDF) which is mission-critical software that must undergo extensive testing prior to fielding. Each MDF must be tested against a different set of system inputs across different scenarios and conditions. The current manual testing process which includes platform-specific script generation, manual operation of the Software Test Environment (STE) and manual validation that the system is meeting performance specifications, can greatly benefit from automation to reduce cost and schedule and increase test coverage. This proposal addresses these challenges by the unique application of end-to-end automation applied to the entire lifecycle of MDF testing. This end-to-end automated testing solution is centered on a system model that defines the overall behavior of the ALE-47 system. This model, along with recorded test data is used to support generation of automated test artifacts including: automated STE scenario scripts, test execution flows that automatically operate the STE during test events, analysis cases for requirements verification, System Requirement Verification Matrix (SRVM) to provide test validation and automatically generated Objective Quality Evidence (OQE) reports."

        "abstract": "Optimizing the AEGIS Combat System against evolving Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ACSM) threats is currently a manual process that involves iterations of research, design, implementation, and testing. This process is tried and true, but also expensive and time-consuming, leaving a static system in place for the duration of the mission. The only cost-effective method of solving this problem is with the use of automation. Invariably, this points toward software-only changes to ACS, as opposed to hardware upgrades. This is especially true given the investment by IWS 1.0 in Combat System Test Bed (CSTBformally the AEGIS Test Bed, ATB).IDT proposes to create a Design Virtual Assistant (DVA). The DVA will encapsulate the thought process of an AEGIS Operations Research Analyst and recommend software-only changes to the AAW system in response to re-designs of ASCM threats. IDT&apos;s automated analysis software, Automated Test and Re-Test (ATRT), can analyze the data CSTB produces from hundreds of thousands of Monte Carlo simulations. Combining this automated analysis capability with the knowledge of an AEGIS Operations Research Analyst, the DVA can suggest parameterized changes to the Combat System configuration (including weapons and sensors) to improve performance against the exercised threat."

        "abstract": "Missile defense applications currently expose inertial measurement units (IMUs) to harsh acceleration, shock, and vibration environments. Furthermore, as missile defense systems become smaller and more complex, they present tighter constraints on size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C), while still requiring high levels of performance in addition to operation through radiation environments. New accelerometer technology must reduce SWaP-C while operating through high-g acceleration environments that are three times higher than current state of the art while not significantly reducing sensitivity and resolution. MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) technology provides potential solutions to these challenges. However, the micro-scale features of MEMS accelerometers that enable SWaP-C benefits also tend to reduce performance capabilities. This proposed SBIR effort will develop a reduced SWaP-C MEMS accelerometer that will operate in these rugged shock, vibration, temperature, and radiation environments. Phase I of the effort will determine the feasibility of a resonant MEMS accelerometer for harsh environment applications, as well as potential fabrication approaches. The Phase II effort will then prototype the device, as well as and characterize its performance under the anticipated environmental conditions.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

The key element of this system is the development of an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) manifold for laser cooling strontium. The extremely narrow linewidth of strontiums optical intercombination transition is ideal for constructing a highly accurate optical clock. At the heart of the ColdQuantas UHV system, a source of low-outgassing strontium will be heated within a source chamber engineered to withstand the chemically aggressive vapor. At sufficiently high vapor pressures, the strontium will be cooled in sequential optical traps formed in the glass and silicon manifold before acting as an atomic frequency standard. This approach has significant advantages in terms of size and power consumption over traditional vacuum systems, as is required for space applications. The vacuum and atomic source technologies can also be applied directly to other atomic species of interest, including calcium, ytterbium, and barium."

Such a system will place challenging demands on the size, weight, and power (SWAP) and robustness of the required timekeeping technology. Chip-scale atomic clocks (CSACs) have leveraged similar demand for good clock performance in a compact package. However, there is a substantial performance gap between CSACs and currently demonstrated laboratory systems. ColdQuanta, in partnership with Vescent Photonics, seeks to fill this gap by combining recent advances in compact cold atom clocks developed at NIST with ColdQuantas robust ultraminiature vacuum cell technology and Vescents frequency stable laser diode technology. Our objective is to develop a high-performance, low SWaP atomic clock. The proposed system utilizes laser light to cool atomic samples using a magneto-optic trap (MOT). During a measurement cycle, atoms are released and allowed to evolve freely. After the evolution period the cold atoms are probed using Ramsey interrogation with coherent population trapping (CPT). The clock signal is obtained by stabilizing the CPT light to the Ramsey signal. The goal is to demonstrate a Technology Readiness Level of 5 with our proposed clock, the Cold-Atom Timekeeper, or CAT, by the end of Phase II."

For resident space objects in MEO or GEO orbit, or SmallSats in low-LEO orbit, imagery with only a few resolution elements may be available; in these cases, the limited and uncertain information content hinders decision making.Spectral Sciences Inc. (SSI) proposes to develop a new satellite identification tool, Cognitive Image Recovery Code (CIRC), to evaluate low resolution imagery, including views from multiple locations and temporal light curves generated from unresolved imagery, through comparisons to potential 3D satellite models.The result will be a predicted 3D model for the satellite and an associated uncertainty. SSIs first-principles QUID simulation code will be used to build training imagery for a deep learning algorithm that matches the data to potential satellite models.QUIDs exceptional combination of fidelity and speed will insure that the simulated imagery is both comprehensive and radiometrically accurate, and make it possible to generate images on-the-fly as the retrievals are refined.Phase I will prototype the basic approach, including generating model assignments and uncertainties, and development of a system-level architecture for the Phase II software."

        "abstract": "Integrated Solutions for Systems, Inc., with the Auburn University GPS and Vehicle Dynamics Lab, will develop three complementary mission planning and fly-out improvements to increase HVP weapon system effectiveness: trajectory shaping guidance (TSG), game-theory guidance (GTG), and Collaborative aim-point offsetting. They will be evaluated using representative HVP and threat models.TSG maximizes projectile speed at intercept to increases the probability of kill (Pk) by increasing kinetic energy at intercept and increasing the available acceleration the projectile has to track the threat.GTG assumes the threat is actively maneuvering to avoid the interceptor. Designing the guidance law to succeed in the worst case gives it a greater likelihood of success across the board.Collaborative aim-point algorithms utilize multiple projectiles to increase overall kill radius. Each projectile is offset in a different direction thereby increasing the effective kill radius. This generates a higher cumulative Pk for a salvo of projectile shots. This approach inherently utilizes the low per-round cost to achieve an equivalent overall effectiveness.Phase I focuses on initial development and evaluation of the algorithms leading to the Phase II goal of implementing the algorithms in a HWIL for higher fidelity evaluation.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

In Phase 1, DataSoft will address this challenge by leveraging its experience with the PMW\/A 170 Advanced TDMA Interface Processor (ATIP) program, modeling and simulation capabilities, Software Defined Radios (SDR), networking and routing expertise to develop and demonstrate key technologies, for ad-hoc routing, subnet management, multi-channel load balancing, and packet aggregation."

        "abstract": "We will develop chip-scale components at 780\/795 nm, for a superluminal ring laser gyroscope and accelerometer (SRLGA) using Rubidium.The components include high-power and narrow-band lasers, modulators, detectors, low-loss waveguides, and micro-resonator based magneto-optic isolators, integrated on a single chip. The components will be built on GaAs substrate.GaAsP Quantum Wells (QWs) will enable the realization of the active photonic components. In sections for the passive components, the QWs would be disordered to minimize optical losses. A resonator containing two miniature vapor cells will be used as the cavity for the two superluminal ring lasers, the beat-note between which will yield the rotation rate.One of the mirrors for the cavity will be mounted on a metallic diaphragm for accelerometry.The chip-mounted components will be interconnected with the cavity, as well as additional electronics on a printed circuit board, for off-set phase locking of lasers, locking to atomic transitions, and processing of rotation and acceleration data. Under Phase I, we will develop a detailed design of the chip-scale SRLGA and demonstrate functionality of key components.Under Phase II, we will demonstrate first operation of an SRGLA for one axis, and then use copies thereof to demonstrate a three-axes superluminal IMU."

        "abstract": "The invention in this proposal provides significant improvements for uncooperative submarine periscope detection and identification through the development of a hybrid multi-mode sensor, consisting of a combined direct-detection imaging flash lidar and a micro-Doppler coherent lidar that would dramatically enhance the effectiveness of operational airborne mission instruments. The lidar solution proposed will have a large field-of-view (FOV) active imaging sensor for basic, yet fast, object detection, a high-power transmitter for long range capability, an electro-optical beam steering aperture for a larger collection area\/small volume and reliability, and a highly sensitive active interrogation sensor for false alarm mitigation and target identification. While the optical signal and receiving detector(s) are different for the two technologies, significant overlap of components can exist if carefully designed; e.g., common scanner, pump lasers, signal processing hardware, and thermal management. The focus of this project will be to provide a lidar where the wide-beam (near) photon-limited direct detection flash lidar acquires detections and very quickly, in-turn the narrow-beam coherent detection lidar is directed to the detection position to interrogate and confirm\/reject those detections as periscope targets. This track-while-scan system with the potential to provide on-location target identification has the ability to be a game-changing US military asset."

        "abstract": "The Lakota Tactical Emulator Ecosystem (LTEE) provides the ability to accurately execute software of legacy systems in a modern host environment. LTEE interprets the legacy software at the machine code or assembly statement level; simulates code execution with accurate clock cycle tracking; provides adaptation to host operating system methods and services, and adapts all inputs and outputs to services and devices on the host system. LTEE&apos;s approach is highly favorable in the use case when legacy code is under test, as it provides a most authentic representation of legacy software execution since it emulates binary code execution code at an assembly instruction level. Direct translation of CMS-2 code into a modern host system architecture would lose the timing and precision characteristics of existing AN\/UYK-43 architecture. LTEE solves many of the problems related to translation of legacy system code, such as interfacing to legacy executives and system libraries, I\/O with legacy hardware, and the intermittent use of direct code. The LTEE is being developed to execute UYK-43 legacy software in an x86\/Linux host, but is extensible to other legacy hardware and hosts systems."

        "abstract": "A key problem with automated mission planning software for military commanders is that their underlying domain models may be incomplete, imprecise, inaccurate, or inefficient and may rapidly become obsolete because of evolving domains. These issues can adversely impact the quality and the effectiveness of support offered by automated software. However, manual maintenance of models planning domain is slow, expensive and error prone. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) present an opportunity to address this problem by automatically acquiring, enriching and updating asset performance models and tactical planning knowledge for use by automated mission software. We will develop CILEMP, a software system comprising Continuous Interactive Learners for Mission Planning. CILEMP shall utilize a family of numeric and symbolic learning approaches to learn from subject matter experts(SMEs) inputs they provide during practice planning sessions and during real operations. We will investigate ML approaches such as learning from demonstration and learning from experience to acquire and update model parameters, planning preferences, and higher order structures for tactics to improve model coverage, precision, accuracy and efficiency. We will work with SMEs to develop scenarios for evaluating the feasibility of CILEMP. We will develop a software architecture specification and prototype implementation plan for Phase II."

        "abstract": "Deep etching is necessary for pixel definition in multi-band infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs) consisting of stacked photodiodes.To eliminate optical crosstalk between pixels and improve modulation transfer function (MTF), the trenches between pixels have to be etched sufficiently deep, resulting in high aspect ratios greater than ~ 5-to-1 in short-pitch FPAs.The resulting loss in optical fill-factor can be restored by carefully controlling the etch profile to achieve total internal reflection of incident light. A good dry etch process will produce smooth pixel sidewalls, remove the need for a subsequent clean-up wet-etch, and be uniform and reproducible.QmagiQ will apply its experience and skills to develop such a process for antimony-based strained layer superlattice (SLS) material.In Phase II, we will apply the process to realize high-performance dualband SLS FPAs with short pixel pitch.This will complement the larger-pitch dualband FPAs we have already commercialized."

Our team proposes a technical plan that considers component criticality, defect criteria for grinding burns and other physical damage states (such as corrosion pitting), residual stress effects in crack growth analyses, and mitigation schemes to stop damage propagation using engineered residual stress.The technical plan defined in the first phase shall be implemented in Phase II to provide robust data for model development. Delivery of a fully functional analytical toolkit is scheduled, per USAF guidelines, in Phase III.Our team plans to use previously developed corrosion structural effects analysis methods, residual stress \/ crack growth analysis methods, successful experience with laser peening, and a strong transition record to provide the USAF with a comprehensive solution package that works seamlessly within the ASIP framework."

        "abstract": "The space domain plays a vital role in commercial, scientific and defense endeavors. Continued safe access to and use of space demands an increased awareness of the capabalities of satellites on orbit and an ability to detect changes that may indicate status and health or operator intent. The proposed research will address this challenge by studying how to rapidly and automatically extract 3D information from a set of 2D images using a new theoretical approach. Our method leverages the observation that the Fourier spectra of man-made space objects have unique patterns of spatial frequencies. These signatures are imprinted in the Fourier amplitude\/phase, Knox-Thompson cross spectrum and the bispectrum by the component shapes of the satellite, e.g. solar panels, cylindrical bodies, antennae, etc. Furthermore, compared to direct imagery, the morphology of the spectrum is much less dependent on the relative arrangement of these components. Our strategy is to identify the unique features in these patterns, and analyze how changes in the feature amplitudes reveal information about the 3D geometry of the satellite. From this analysis, current techniques in machine learning, parameter estimation and &apos;structure from motion&apos; will be adapted to the problem of building a 3D model from the Fourier features."

The goal of the OMIPA system is to revolutionize the air mission and strike planning process through the application of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence. Mission and strike planning is a difficult and time-consuming process. Given a variety of mission objectives, the space of possible mission plans to achieve those objectives is too large for human planners to exhaustively explore. OMIPA will revolutionize the mission and strike planning process through the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Technically, OMIPA will feature adaptations of cutting edge AI techniques, including case based analysis, semi-supervised learning, adversarial RL training of neural networks, Monte Carlo tree search, and evolutionary computation. These techniques will help human planners create better, highly robust plans more quickly and reliably for a range of missions; they have been chosen to avoid the technical challenges described above. Powerful ML and AI algorithms will drive OMIPAs ability to generate actionable insights in the mission planning process, but it is our staged approach to the development and implementation of OMIPA that will be the key to system success,"

Perceptronics Solutions recognizes the criticality of performance assessment as an element of effective training. For this project, we will leverage two directly related previous Navy efforts; these are: (1) MPMS (Multi-Modal Performance Measurement System) is an assessment tool that will capture performance data from a variety of live, virtual, and constructive sources. MPMS will also provide data-derived performance measures, identify skill deficits, trace deficit sources, and prescribe remediative performance enhancing evolutions. (2) DECIDE (Diagnostic Engine for Cognitive Improvement and Decision Effectiveness) will provide AviatorDX with an innovative methodology for observer-based training assessment, diagnosis and improvement. We will adapt and extend the capabilities of DECIDE and MPMS to meet the goals of the AviatorDX project."

Addressing this limitation, Dynamic Dimension Technologies (DDT), proposes to create the Water incorporated and Autonomy enabled Virtual Environment (WAVE) to accurately represent the multi-domain environmental states which influences amphibious vehicle motions. Based on lessons learned from a decade of developing M&amp;S for autonomous ground vehicle testing, DDT will design and develop a novel open architecture simulation framework which embraces naturalistic multi-domain environments required for amphibious autonomy systems evaluations. During Phase I, DDT will define an innovative methodology and modeling architecture that supports simulating full 6 degree-of-freedom, multibody dynamics for amphibious vehicles. These models will represent the full vehicle system with articulating components, hull form geometry, tires\/tracks, suspension, brakes, steering, engine, propulsion, etc., and interactions with the water, terrain and air. WAVE will include communications models for scenarios such as remote operations, formation maneuvers, swarming, teaming, etc., and sensor models (i.e. GPS, IMU, EO\/IR, RF, Sonar, etc.) for autonomy algorithms such as perception, world model, decision making and route planning."

        "abstract": "There is an urgent need to improve protection of our soldiers without losing mobility and maneuverability. As personal protection equipment becomes more sophisticated and multifunctional for protection against ballistics, shrapnel, and stabbing, it has also become heavier and more cumbersome. This additional mass can inhibit troop movement and potentially compromise the mission and even survivability. Therefore, there is an immediate need to replace existing ceramic ballistic plates such as the SAPI, ESAPI, SBI, and ESBI with lighter and thinner materials.Recent advances in nanostructured metal alloys have demonstrated enhanced mechanical and strength properties compared to macroscopic alloys. These nanostructured or ultrafine-grained (UFG) alloys can exhibit extremely high specific strength (strength relative to mass). Specific strength, elastic modulus and strain to failure are the key mechanical properties of ballistic protection. However the manufacturing of nanostructured alloys is difficult to control and scale. Mainstream Engineering will develop nanostructured alloys through additive and advanced manufacturing lightweight, high strength ballistic alloys."

Wagner Associates will construct a high-level, physics-based, probabilistic model of an anti-ballistic missile intercept event, characterizing and integrating various sensor phenomenologies from a probabilistic perspective; and we will develop multi-sensor data fusion techniques to estimate the effectiveness of the engagement. Our approach will emphasize Bayesian inference techniques to support System-level Post-Intercept Assessment (BPIA) by developing a Bayesian Network (BN) whose structure encodes the relevant ground truth features\/signatures and their probabilistic relationships. Our sophisticated multi-sensor data fusion engine software, which employs our Bayesian Inference Engine (BIE) for feature-aided data association, will be configured to use this BN to process multiple diverse sensor outputs during and after an interception event. Further, we will develop supporting processes for translating high-level sensor data as evidence for the BN, to be processed alongside kinematic clues from the association\/tracking components of data fusion system. Finally, we will identify and create a plan for implementing the more sophisticated BIE enhancements that would be undertaken during Phase II as part of a more complex BPIA prototype.

Pre-intercept information may be subject to uncertainty or accuracy considerations, meaning that a pre-intercept effectiveness assessment should be refined by post-intercept sensor data. Toyon Research Corporation and Modern Technology Solutions, Inc. (MTSI) propose a solution that uses data from multiple sensors when available to perform this post-intercept effectiveness assessment enhancement. Features based on the post-intercept scene will be constructed via investigation of physically-rigorous simulated interception scenes. The extraction of these features in an automated fashion will be implemented via a particle probability hypothesis density filter that can obtain kinematic tracks in a system in which the number and distribution of tracks is not known. Using physics-based simulated data and the automated feature extraction, intercept effectiveness and associated variables will be parameterized. Fusion of different sensor modalities in order to result in an estimate of the effectiveness will be performed via probabilistic statistical modeling.  Toyon and MTSI will create physically reasonable scenes for testing in order to demonstrate the superior capability of our algorithms to robustly estimate the effectiveness of an intercept over pre-intercept assessments.

        "abstract": "Measuring and characterizing the post-intercept state of a missile intercept event is critical for determination of interceptor lethality and kill assessments (KA). A number of sensors (including radar and spectral and imaging sensors) have been used to characterize these events. FreEnt proposes an innovative approach to KA based on mathematical formalisms successfully employed in atomic and molecular Statistical Mechanics and Particle Physics. Our State-Vector Density Functional (SVDF) method treats the intercept event similar to the treatment of particle scattering events in a particle collider experiment. The initial states of the target and the interceptor are defined by the kinematics of the hit-conditions. These are determined from radar tracking data, optical spectra, and imaging data which may identify a particular booster type and hence a set of possible target payloads.  The method assumes existing space-based, ground-based, and airborne sensors are capable of measuring specific state variables which determine the intercept conditions. State-vectors are then defined for the initial and final states of the system from which the SVDF quantity can be computed. This quantity is then shown to be proportional to the probability the final state of the system and target is consistent with the target being defeated.

        "abstract": "Corvid Technologies will develop in-situ instrumentation to measure key physical states in reacting high explosives.  The emerging measurement capability will provide state information to support lethality analysis by enabling equation of state development for computational models, as well as fast-running engineering codes for evaluating HE response to stimuli. Development of internal temperature and pressure sensors will be the focus of the innovative research. Design goals are to develop sensors with minimal impact on the material response with high spatial and temporal resolution. Sensor design will focus on optical, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric sensors. Each sensor approach has the potential to collect pressure data, temperature can be measured using optical methods. Down selection will be done using decision matrix based on deployability, temporal resolution, spatial resolution, accuracy, and cost. Expect peak pressures of 400 kbars and peak temperatures of 7000 K. Our teaming arrangements enable the employment of high speed optical data capability and optical fiber expertise that will be critical for development of optical sensors. Corvids experience in studying reactive materials from no reaction, deflagration, low order, to a high order response and experience in sensor development\/deployment on reactive tests will be leveraged in the development of these sensors.

        "abstract": "To address the MDAs need for an innovative, low-cost process to perform inline environment generation for real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing and constructive digital simulations, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Synthetic Inline Generation of Modeled Atmosphere (SIGMA) system based on deep modeling and GPU acceleration. The innovation in using multi-layer stacked deep network modeling and GPU accelerators enables close replication of existing environment models and data, without their time-consuming computationally expensive processes, to provide inline generation of credible environment data, with up to 3 orders of magnitude speed improvement, for Tier 1 and Tier 2 modeling and simulation (M&amp;S). As a result, SIGMA eliminates the need for pre-generating environment data and allows more test cases to be executed with environments turned on, with no code modification needed. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of SIGMA by designing its high-level information architecture and componentized system design, developing prototype system, testing it using SHARC\/SAMM Atmosphere Generator, and demonstrating its total test case runtime increase by less than 10%. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and deliver a full-scale prototype system, incorporating additional models, and demonstrate its total test case runtime increase by less than 5%.

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to utilize a ground-based simulation facility based upon its patented FAST technology to obtain critical data necessary to validate and extend the capabilities of the MDAs high altitude plume code: SOCRATES-P.  Far-field plume signatures arise from the hyperthermal interaction of rocket plume effluent with the atmosphere at altitudes greater than 100 km.  In Phase I we propose to use a tunable, hypervelocity oxygen atom source (6-12 km\/s) to measure the velocity dependent cross section of oxygen atoms reacting with one selected component of the thruster exhaust with products emitting in the primary sensor band: 2.0  5.0 micrometer.  The data will be compared to computational chemistry results from Spectral Sciences Inc.  Phase I will also design a pulsed supersonic source of vibrationally excited reactants.  A Phase I option is proposed that will characterize emission from reaction products with 15 cm-1 spectral resolution to further test the computational chemistry methods that underlie the signature code.  In Phase II the source of vibrationally excited reactants will be implemented onto the FAST facility.  This new capability will be utilized to significantly advance the range of plume phenomenology that can be addressed with the simulation facility.

        "abstract": "Cybersecurity is one of the greatest challenges of the twenty-first century, as it imposes requirements for automated monitoring of system status and information states in order to achieve operational security.  To date there has been limited planning conducted to account for cybersecurity risks in the case of cyber data information capture and analysis.  This is especially the case for Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) federated and non-federated simulations, which are a keystone to large Enterprise based computational systems relied upon by the MDA.  Expansion of data capture beyond traditional assessments is therefore necessary in order to achieve cyber resiliency.  Unintended analog information leakage of critical cyber data through side channels, such as radiated and conducted electromagnetic emissions, provide critical insight into cyber information states and health status that must be included in a robust and resilient solution.  Under this effort, Nokomis will conclusively demonstrate the feasibility of using unintended emissions to automatically acquire and analyze cyber information states, providing real-time cyber health assessment and real-time detection of cyber-attacks such as adversarial intrusions.  The Phase I Base Period focuses on demonstrating technical feasibility and advantages, while the Option Period focuses on specifying the CONOPS best suited to the missile defense M&amp;S Enterprise.

Our Phase I project will focus on using a simulation optimization approach to solve the problem of generating a minimal collection of test scenarios, using the minimum number of shared scenario components, that meets a required set of test objectives.  Each individual scenario taken through the end to end scenario generation process involves substantial effort including discussion, documentation, and manual scenario generation in high fidelity tools.  Likewise, scenario components require a great deal of time and effort to prepare for the test event.  We will explore the possibility of using an optimization tool with medium fidelity digital simulation models early in the scenario generation process to minimize the required test scenarios and scenario components.  Reducing the number of test scenarios and scenario components has the potential to significantly reduce the end to end scenario generation timeline and associated costs.    We will leverage the SBIR-derived OptDef simulation optimization and analysis tool to prototype our scenario generation optimization approach.  We will also evaluate the current scenario generation process and recommend insertion points for this new technology to enable maximum benefit.

The benefit of this capability is realistic debris truth modeling for NHTK engagements to support a variety of MDA element and Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) frameworks and use cases to complement the existing capability for hit-to-kill (HTK) engagements. This HTK debris capability features the MDA Kinetic Impact Debris Distribution (KIDD) model [1], which we develop for MDA as part of the Core Lethality Model (CLM) Program.  Our approach to NHTK debris modeling includes (1) enhancing existing fragment and blast models in the Parametric Endo\/Exoatmospheric Lethality Simulation (PEELS) [2], which we develop for MDA as part of the CLM Program; and (2) developing a new NHTK debris model leveraging the KIDD model where appropriate to address NHTK debris.  For Phase I we propose using a combination of PEELS results for NHTK engagements, NHTK test data, and NHTK first-principle code results to determine modeling priorities and develop conceptual models for addressing these priorities. Commercialization applications include NHTK interceptor program offices, BMDS M&amp;S framework program offices and stakeholders and associated contractors.

RITES is based on a new software design that utilizes POC-developed mature software components and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software components. Specifically, the innovation in in-house real-time ionosphere and troposphere radiation environment characterization algorithms and RF propagation modules will enable the system to identify attenuation effects along the UHF, X band, and K band. As a result, this model offers real-time operation in the required bands, which directly addresses the MDA requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of RITES by identifying the attenuation effects of the ionosphere and troposphere along the RF bands and providing a proof-of-concept demonstration of the model, reaching Technology Readiness Level (TRL)-4. In Phase II, POC plans to complete a detailed prototype design of the software\/model incorporating government performance requirements, reaching TRL-6.

To meet the MDAs requirements for an M&amp;S tool that simulates propagation effects in real time and assesses radar system performance, Charles River Analytics proposes to develop a system for Modeling the Effects of RF Attenuation in the Troposphere and Ionosphere (MODERATION). MODERATION will: (1) simulate RF tropospheric and ionospheric propagation, target scattering, and external noise, clutter, and interference under varied conditions; (2) characterize radar performance by comparing the signals reflected by target scattering centers with the signals received by the radar antenna; (3) operate in real time by incorporating an assessment\/management function that dynamically regulates the simulation fidelity for each propagation phenomenon consistent with its marginal effect on radar performance, and chooses software and\/or hardware accelerators as necessary to achieve the required computational speed; and (4) use a modular open software architecture to facilitate integration with the Objective Simulation Framework (OSF) and other MDA M&amp;S tools.

Also the current models are not coordinated to present a globally consistent environment picture and can be based on functions that have not been updated to take advantage of the environment models and databases that have become freely available in the information age. We propose environment model updates to mitigate these performance limitations. Radar atmospheric effects models whose behavior is derived from globally consistent environment models can produce radar sensor effects that represent a higher fidelity instantiation of the environment affecting the entire missile defense system. We propose developing a system of radar environment effects modules that derive their behavior from global environment models such as the Standardized Atmosphere Generator (SAG), the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), and the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF). For ionospheric radar effects we will address scintillation, range delay, auroral clutter, and Faraday rotation\/absorption. Current scintillation models rely on conventional solar and geomagnetic observables such as sunspot number and planetary K index, Kp.

        "abstract": "The US Missile Defense Agency is seeking to develop innovative architectures and\/or high temperature electronics for increasing the temperature capability of actuators used with proportionally controlled valves\/thrusters.  Solid propellant exhaust gases are commonly 2,000-4,000F while the actuator to valve\/thruster interface commonly must be limited to less than 200-300F.  This relatively low temperature limit at the actuator interface is often a driving design factor in many propulsion control systems.    Successful development of higher temperature capable actuators has the potential to increase the operation times of future SPCS and offer propulsion vendors increased system design flexibility.  These desired improvements for actuators can potentially be achieved through; innovative architectures, the design of high temperature electronic controls, or enhanced materials.  During Phase I we will review and apply the latest state-of-the-art materials, actuator design topologies, bearing materials and high temperature power electronics to design an actuator that can operate ambient temperatures in excess of 400\/450 F (minimum\/target).  Using thermal and magnetic finite element analysis we will validate the design.    During the Phase I Option we will expand the design and include failure and vibration analysis.  Upon successful validation we will then generate a complete print package to prepare for Phase II.  Approved for Public Release | 16-MDA-8917 (15 November 16)"

        "abstract": "Integrated Global Insights, LLC (IGI) proposes the development of a hybrid actuator system architecture that incorporates two new features into an existing electro-mechanical actuator.  These features improve fine position accuracy, improve actuator thermal management risk, and increases kill vehicle delta-V performance because of reduced power consumption.  Long duration missions, using solid propulsion control systems, typically command small, precise position changes for 90% of the total mission.  IGIs first feature incorporate a secondary motor system to provide this fine position control to reduce the use of the high power draw electro-mechanical motor.  Thermal management of the actuator can be a challenge for the long duration missions.  IGIs second feature provides a seal internal to the thruster between the actuator to thruster pintle interface.  This feature increases the thermal capability of the dynamic seal while providing load reduction to the actuator.  Coupling these two features with a modified control system approach results in a reduction in power consumption of 48%, the elimination of the need for multiple thermal batteries which results in lower inert weight and a potential 2.6% increase in kill vehicle delta-V.

Nu-Trek is proposing to add radiation hardening to a high performance, high dynamic range LWIR\/LWIR sensor using a multifaceted approach that includes a high frame rate and a novel debris gamma &amp; beta filter. The LWIR\/LWIR sensor will be rad hard to nuclear and near earth orbit environments, addressing critical missile defense requirements, for both improved performance and radiation hardness. The proposed sensor extends the state of the art of LWIR sensors currently in use in MDA seekers, offering a larger format, a higher dynamic range, and a higher frame rate. The LWIR sensor can also operate in very high debris gamma and beta fluxes and recovers in one frame after a nuclear event. All these attributes contribute to an enhanced probability of kill (Pk).

T2SL-based sensors consist of III-V compound semiconductors which have much stronger bonding than II-VI-based sensors, and should be less susceptible to ionizing and nuclear particle radiation.  This will we experimentally verified during this project and new techniques for radiation hardening of T2SL-based sensors will be developed. New insight will be gained by putting forward density distribution models and then comparing the predicted output with all experimental data for close verification. Having identified the source of the problems and in order to improve current hardness performance, the superlattice and device design will be optimized. In detail, this means paying special attention to achieve best passivation under radiation conditions, and the possibility of chemically modifying current polymers materials  for optimized radiation blockage.  Dark current and mechanisms such as defect assisted tunneling are other parameters which need special attention and optimization. This will be done by developing thin film radiation filters grown on top of the photodetectors and then quantitatively demonstrating the radiation hardness of T2SL-based sensors and their viability under long-term exposure to space radiation.

        "abstract": "Navigation performance of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) is governed by the accuracies of initial alignment, gyroscopic drift and in the presence of fast maneuvers by the settling time of gyroscopes and accelerometers.  The proposed SBIR work is a re-visit of the autonomous calibration problem using Higher Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) control solutions. The HOSM approach allows the separation of complex Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output control problem into a set of simpler Single-Input, Single-Output control problems. This approach achieves faster convergence and settling times, and is robust to system and gyroscope noise.   HOSM observers will be developed, using internal dynamical models of the sensor electro-mechanical dynamics, to reconstruct (estimate) the input signal from the IMU measured output. Reconstructed signal settling time is solely governed by observer settling time and thus, is much smaller than sensor electro-mechanical dynamical response. Moreover, the reconstructed signal can be made practically devoid of measurement noise without adverse effects on the response time.  This approach is similar to digital thermometers that produce temperature measurement estimates much before the thermometer thermal equilibrium is reached. The proposed work will benefit IMU accelerometer and gyroscope measurement performance and reduce autonomous alignment times, but is applicable to a wide class of measurement systems.

        "abstract": "QuNav proposes to develop a TRansform-domain INS Mechanization and Algorithmic Correction (TRIMAC) in order to improve the accuracy of inertial navigation in the absence of external aids. TRIMAC will implement a transform-domain INS mechanization, which uses an exact analytical solution of underlying inertial differential equations (as opposed to traditionally applied numerical approximations) thus eliminating computational errors (such as conning and sculling). When no external navigation aids are available, mitigation of measurement errors (due to IMU sensor errors such as noise, biases, scale-factors, etc.) will be addressed using a probabilistic motion model. A stochastic motion model will be developed for missile applications. A partitioned estimator will be then applied for joint model identification\/INS error estimation. Specifically, a non-linear Bayesian estimator will be used to identify critical disturbance modes. The maximum likelihood mode (or a subset of modes) will be then applied for the error estimation and subsequent drift mitigation using near-linear batch estimation techniques. Batch estimation is particularly beneficial for a) decoupling of INS error states and unknown modeling parameters via null-space projection; and, b) robust estimation in presence of non-Gaussian outliers via statistical gating and probabilistic data associating filtering.

        "abstract": "To address the MDA need for tooling and processes for repeatable adhesive dispensing onto threaded fasteners in missile production, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Locking Adhesive DIspensing onto threaded Fasteners (LADIF) system. The proposed system including associated tooling and processes utilizes novel gripping mechanism, electronic control, and mature dispensing components to meet precise volumetric dispensing requirements while mitigating future obsolescence and delays in development. Specifically, innovations in the mechanical design and automated process allow the operator to treat different fasteners (nuts, bolts, helicoils and inserts) and dispense locking liquid compounds (LLCs) uniformly along the threaded surface. LADIF offers accurate, consistent, and repeatable adhesive dispensing, achieving the required strength for installed fastener. In Phase I, POC will characterize the LLCs for processing sensitivities, proper cure time, and the amount of LLC required to achieve optimum breakaway torque values. POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the LADIF system by developing processes for LLC application and deliver an initial prototype for reproducible application. In Phase II, POC will deliver a plan for testing, verification, and validation and perform demonstration and testing of an improved prototype as well as the design for associated tooling for LLC application.

The CAPCO SecureThread system will incorporate a microvalve dispenser along with a rotary collet and translating linear stage which will allow for precise (nanoliter scale accuracy), repeatable, and adjustable application of LLCs directly to the thread root. SecureThread features a modular interface for use with a broad range of fasteners and threaded items (e.g. ignitors): with external and internal threads, varying thread pitch and handedness, material, length, diameter, and drive type.    Subsequent to the prototype development of the SecureThread system, CAPCO will perform extensive analysis on fasteners, LLCs, and primers of interest to the MDA. LLC application volume and distribution specifications are not well understood, so processing sensitivities, cure times, and the minimum amount of LLC required to achieve optimum breakaway torque values will be investigated. Preliminary work by the proposer suggests that the relative increase in breakaway torque provided by LLCs depends more on the application method than the amount of LLC applied. Optimized LLC and fastener configurations will be vibration tested per MIL-STD-801 to verify LLC performance in MDA configurations of interest.

        "abstract": "Currently, optical measurements available on target plumes and re-entry wakes are collected by air or ground assets which view the wake\/plume photons after having been filtered through the atmosphere. Atmospheric transmission removes significant information needed to anchor models that simulate these phenomena. MDA needs innovative approaches to mount a spectrometer on the aft closure of the RV.  This innovation would enable collection of near-field spectral data, unfiltered by the atmosphere. The unfiltered spectral data should improve the current wake\/plume models and expand our knowledge of the wake\/plume species and the underlying chemistry of the wake\/plume phenomena.  The plume from a hydrocarbon-fueled rocket engine will contain molecular species CO2 and H2O as well as short-lived radical species such as C2, CO, CH, CN, OH, and NO.  The species likely to be observed in the wake of a reentry vehicle are N2, O2, N, O, NO and NO+ from ionized air. These molecules have spectral signatures in the range 200-850 nm.  Bodkin Design &amp; Engineering will demonstrate a fast, compact spectral imaging system which will detect these chemical species and which can be flown on a rocket booster or reentry vehicle (RV) to acquire plume\/wake data throughout the missiles flight path.

SOLO FASP will utilize open architecture components for integration of multiple sensor packages within the same form factor, software defined radio for telemetry, reaction wheels for pointing, and state of the art radar absorbing material. SOLO FASP can be deployed as a single sensor for truth collection or can be used with multiple SOLO FASPs. It will be capable of recording truth data of mission phenomenology including deployment of Associated Objects (AOs), target object deployment, debris and intercept related events.  nSI will model RCS and IR signatures determining appropriate shape and material solutions with design goal of being below the detection threshold of BMDS Radars and seekers. SOLO FASP will be capable of being integrated into existing canisters and will conform to the AO Interface Control Document. Innovative manufacturing methods and materials will be required to meet the signature requirements which makes the development of SOLO FASP ideally suited for MDAs SBIR initiative.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this effort is to demonstrate the viability of algorithms for calculating the temperatures and optical (visible and infrared) signatures of objects (e.g., targets) containing transmissive and partially transmissive materials. Industry-standard codes such as the Optical Signatures Code (OSC) and OPTISIG assume that all materials are opaque, which can lead to substantial errors in the calculation of the signatures of these targets. Though measurements of material transmissivity exist, these codes cannot properly use the measurements. Proven first principles techniques, such as ray-tracing, can be used to account for the complex thermal and optical phenomenology, but require parallelization and methodologies for balancing computational times and accuracy. In this Phase I effort, multiple algorithms for calculating the thermal (emitted) component of the signature (e.g., ray tracing, modified radiosity) and the reflected component of the signature (forward and backward ray-tracing, photon mapping) will be evaluated for computational speed and compared to existing high-fidelity codes. The result will be candidate algorithms for augmenting existing OSC\/OPTISIG methodologies which will more accurately predict the optical signatures of future complex targets and countermeasures.

IERUS Technologies proposes to develop a high accuracy, computationally efficient optical\/IR modeling capability for objects made up of arbitrary combinations of multilayered transmissive and reflective materials.  IERUS will accomplish this by combining several existing in-house tools with our deep experience modeling and characterizing IR signatures and material properties.

        "abstract": "Threat signature phenomenology plays an important role in the development of missile defense technologies, both at tactical and strategic levels.  However, threats from non-traditional, non-symmetric reentry systems, even spent boosters and flight hardware, have become more acute.  Such non-traditional, three-dimensional (3D) systems at high dynamic pressure, high angle of attack often have limited, optically dim (or even no) propulsion systems so ablation, ionization, wake flows, etc., play a more crucial role to the overall signature phenomenology.  The current generation of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools contain advanced capabilities for these features but are largely based on axisymmetric assumptions to facilitate rapid computational throughput resulting in the breakdown of predictive capabilities for 3D threats.  This effort proposes to enhance these tools by injecting high-fidelity, 3D simulation results within the existing M&amp;S pipeline, such as the Optical Signatures Code, to compensate for axisymmetric deficiencies without adversely affecting the overall computational throughput.  Using an innovative and adaptive database technology, fed by judiciously selected high-fidelity 3D simulations performed offline, inputs (angle of attack, geometry, flight conditions) are correlated to outputs (total intensity, station radiation, flowfield conditions) virtually instantaneously.  Hence, much needed improvements are obtained while maintaining the historical president of the current M&amp;S tools.  Approved for Public Release | 16-MDA-8917 (15 November 16)"

Solid rocket motor and arcjet test results showed that the foam provides effective reinforcement for a conventional chopped fiber ablator and helps to retain the char layer, which reduces the erosion rate and the pyrolysis rate of the underlying virgin ablator, thereby reducing heat transfer. The composite offers good strength and stiffness, does not suffer from delamination and pocketing issues that can occur in continuously reinforced ablators, and has demonstrated high resistance to alumina particulate erosion. However, the ablator formulation in ablator-filled foam contains rayon-derived carbon fiber from Enka (Germany) to minimize thermal conductivity. The potential exists to replace rayon-derived fiber with an alternative fiber that is domestically manufactured using a process that is not damaging to the environment.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9219 (31 May 17)"

A Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) measures mass loss, other measurement instrumentation does not. The innovative concept involves using this mass loss to synchronize the decomposition rate of all instruments so that mass loss effects can be included by using TGA measured mass loss. The Phase I is structured to provide a proof-of-concept for a single material heating\/cooling\/heating cycle. A Phase II would expand and refine the methodology for all instruments, initiate work to scale results from coupon size to full-scale component size samples and begin incorporation of the new measurement technology into thermal response simulations. Successful demonstration of this innovative methodology is patentable and can be used for commercial measurements.

The acquired data will be compared with legacy experimental data to demonstrate the feasibility of the novel technique.  Our extensive background in successfully modeling the high-temperature response of composite materials will be applied to the new data leading to new decomposing material models.  The Phase II activities will center on comparing the new methodology with existing models.  Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9219 (31 May 17)"

        "abstract": "i3 proposes to develop and implement a new time-efficient technique for generating statistically-based material response models that predict the decomposition process (pyrolisizing \/charring) that thermal protection system materials undergo when exposed to severe aerothermal heating environments.The proposed material response design process integrates the use of novel test and evaluation (T&amp;E) methodologies and facilities coupled to new modeling and simulation approaches.The resulting combination of novel testing and Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) will enable the ability to develop high fidelity thermochemical decomposition models to support transient aerothermal analysis and system design. This process emphasizes the importance of measuring, recording, and predicting transient material behavior over the entire range of flight relevant environments.Ground testing will include the use of the AFRL Laser Hardened Materials Evaluation Laboratory (LHMEL) facility, a 10 kilo-watt fiber laser, to generate flight representative heating.Transient, in-depth thermal and density responses will be recorded and provided as inputs into to novel M&amp;S method to define kinetic decomposition coefficients for the Arrhenius Rate equation.Decomposition parameters including temperature dependent thermal conductivity and specific heat, pyrolysis gas enthalpy, and various kinetic decomposition constants will be derived iteratively, culminating in the successful demonstration of a cost and time efficient, accurate process for characterizing material decomposition.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9219 (31 May 17)"

        "abstract": "To meet the Marine Corps&apos; need for data in transit encryption algorithms for hand-held devices and man-pack radios, Grier Forensics proposes developing Violet. Violet is a new encryption algorithm, compatible with hand-held devices and man-pack radios, that protects the integrity and confidentiality of all data while fully supporting all forms of network transmission, including multicast. Violet will be developed as a pure software solution, available for Android and Windows, and designed for NSA Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) certification. Violet involves two sub-algorithms: Midia (Multiparty IP Data-in-transit Initialization Algorithm), which initializes encryption for any number of parties over any network transmission mode, and IPsec Transport Mode, which is used for packet level encryption and authentication.

This rugged all-terrain miniature sensor (RAMS) system must be covert and easy to setup not providing any audio\/visual indication of it operating (beyond a brief indication during emplacement), and will transmit data to a user with a very low probability of intercept. The sensor must weigh 500g or less, operate for 7 days continuously, and use a standard COTS battery. The sensors will communicate with a COTS smart phone\/tablet, located approximately 50m away, via an encrypted communications link using AES-256, with minimal latency. McQ will leverage its 30 years of sensor system development experience to select the appropriate hardware platform, detection algorithms, and communication design to solve the unique requirements of this system. McQ will develop a multi channel and multi modal algorithm which utilize multiple small and low cost transducers in a single sensor, to provide enhanced processing gain to detect personnel at extended ranges in both rural and noisy environments  all while maintaining an extremely low false alarm rate."

        "abstract": "The Improved Position and Azimuth Determining System (IPADS) takes up 6400 cubic inches, weighs 135 pounds with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and requires 200 watts of power. Clearly, there is a need to reduce its size, weight, and power (SWAP) footprint. The embedded inertial measurement unit (IMU) is the most SWAP- and performance-critical component of the system, which also includes optics, a display, and a battery. The existing IMU technology makes use of high-performance ring-laser gyroscopes (RLGs) and accelerometers. Since the required azimuth accuracy is 0.4 mil probable error (PE), the gyroscopes need to be capable of demonstrating bias instability (flicker) of no worse than 0.003 deg\/hr. Hence, a high-end navigation-grade IMU is required. Unfortunately, while micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) have drastically improved SWAP requirements, existing MEMS-based IMU performance has not approached the required level of bias stability, especially without external aiding. Therefore, a system that includes intrinsic self-calibration capabilities, which can compensate for the deficiency of MEMS sensors, is necessary to meet the IPADS performance requirements. For this program, Toyon will develop a self-calibrating compact PADS-replacement that will be inertial-sensor agnostic and will allow for in-field IMU replacements as technology improves."

        "abstract": "Sealed suppressors are routinely used by the U.S. Marines, both in the field and on practice ranges. Suppressors are critical not only to help obscure the location of a sniper, but also to protect the shooter from hearing damage. Sealed suppressors are susceptible to significant fouling that degrades their accuracy and that can lead to failure of the suppressor, particularly when they are used at high firing rates. Unfortunately, because the units do not disassemble, it is currently impractical to clean them to return them to a state that is suitable for use. For this reason, suppressors must be replaced frequently even when they are otherwise serviceable. Because suppressors are expensive, a reliable and high volume method of cleaning them is required, both to save the funds that would otherwise be spent on replacement suppressors, and so that they can be adopted more broadly by the USMC. TDA proposes to develop an inexpensive and environmentally friendly method of cleaning rifle suppressors that will not only work for the M40 sniper rifle suppressors but that will also be compatible with other ammunition calibers. The TDA cleaning kit will be made from COTS items, and it will restore the performance of heavily"

This technology can be stowed during land and low-speed water operations and deployed when improved speed and efficiency in water mobility is desired. When deployed, the hull will increase the effective hull length and reduce the drag of the wheels and other protuberances. Braided inflatable beams can approach the strength of rigid structures while retaining the low cost, low stowage volume, and ease of deployment of inflatable structures. These features combined with a tension fabric system offer the promise of a novel hull structure that will improve the performance of amphibious vehicles while keeping cost and complexity to a minimum. With the success of the proposed Phase I effort, a technology will be established that can be utilized to improve existing amphibious vehicles, be incorporated in new amphibious vehicle designs, and be used in new inflatable recreational and military boat design."

        "abstract": "The single biggest technical challenge in developing an amphibious vehicle with the required speed and range is this: the hull shape required for an effective land-mobile armored fighting vehicle produces too much hydrodynamic drag and too little buoyancy to achieve the speed and endurance required to support an over-the-horizon amphibious assault. However, innovative adaptive hull devices comprised of lightweight, relatively simple inflatable structures can overcome these shortcomings while avoiding the mechanical complexity that plagued the canceled EFV program. New engineered textiles make it possible to create inflatable adaptive hull shapes to provide additional buoyancy, as well as to reduce drag through improved hydrodynamic performance. Using drop-stitch fabric to create stiff inflatable panels, it is possible to develop compact modular systems to attach, deploy, retract, and stow inflatable components that will yield improved hydrodynamic performance. These components could be used on the next generation Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV 2.0), or adapted for use with existing AAVs, or as an enhancement to the ACV 1.1 currently in development. We propose to use buoyant panels attached to the parent vehicle hull to improve vehicle performance at sea, increasing hydrodynamic lift and decreasing resistance to achieve the target speed of 25 knots."

        "abstract": "Orbital Traction (Orbital) proposes to research the fuel efficiency gains possible by implementation of an innovative controlled velocity accessory drive (CVAD) system on multiple accessories for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV). Research includes CVAD implementation directly on existing accessories and a Mechanical Mild Hybrid Controlled Velocity Accessory Drive System (MMH-CVAD) which allows for optimization of the ACV&apos;s engine accessories (e.g., alternator, cooling fan, A\/C compressor, etc.) using a combination of mechanical continuously variable transmissions (CVT) and\/or high efficiency, high power density generators. By optimizing the engine accessories as a system, Orbital believes that up to 15% improvement can be achieved for the ACV, which can in turn extend the vehicle range and silent watch capabilities. Orbitals proposed solution is based on a proprietary CVT technology that has already demonstrated the potential for significant fuel efficiency improvements for individual front end accessory drives, is non-invasive to the engine and can be used with existing military approved engine accessories."

        "abstract": "The output of this Phase I will be several lighter weight ACV 1.1 potential candidates, these include components within the land and marine propulsion systems (drive shafts and propeller), hull shapes (bow vane and stern\/trim flaps) as well as doors, hatches, inlet grill, exhaust ducts and grills. These components will take advantage of the ideal properties that composite has to offer: lightweight, high specific strength, inherent corrosions resistance, limited constraints in shape and contour. To minimize un-sprung weight and provide the requisite strength\/stiffness, in the propulsion system we anticipate the use of composite drive shafts for the wheels and propellers. For the propeller blades and shrouds we anticipate using Sandwiching a low-density, lightweight foam core material between thin face sheets can dramatically increase a laminate&apos;s stiffness to match a metallic part with decrease in weight. A sandwich structure is also cost-effective because the relatively low-cost core replaces the materials that would be used to produce a thick laminate.PEI will also investigate using hydrophobic coatings with nano additives on composite shrouds, bow and stern planes surfaces to improve abrasion and impact damage resistance as well as reduce drag. Significant drag reduction has been measured in turbulent flows over hydrophobic surfaces."

The ability of ACV to traverse the beach and project force inland once ashore is critical to meeting the Expeditionary Force 21 directive. Unique to the ACV is the addition of ballistic and blast protection technologies, increasing vehicle survivability and occupant protection with an associated impact on vehicle weight, mobility, and mission performance requiring additional horsepower. GS Engineering, Inc. has an established history of technology development and optimization of vehicle systems for similar tactical ground vehicle applications. This includes full rate production contracts for ongoing build activities and depot level resets of lightweight SBIR technologies. With experience ranging from automated terrain characterization feeding multiple downstream vehicle systems, to selective component redesign for light-weighting, GS Engineering will apply the same aggressive and innovative design approach coupled with similar technology impact assessment methodologies to bring forward an integrated ACV Fuel Efficiency Kit that achieves the Marine Corps goals of 10-15% fuel usage reduction in a cost effective commercially viable solution."

While relatively efficient, even the best vehicle turbodiesel engines have efficiencies of only 30-44% depending on operating condition. Since the engine inefficiency is the largest energy loss, we will focus on scavenging waste energy from power plant of the vehicle. Mainstream will also combine vehicle energy regeneration synergistically with the waste energy scavenging to improve fuel efficiency. We calculate that the approach will yield a 10.5% improvement in fuel efficiency when evaluated over the anticipated drive cycle of the ACV 1.1. The proposed approach has additional benefits including potential faster acceleration and deceleration rates, as well as being a near drop-in replacement to the current power plant."

        "abstract": "To address the U.S. Marine Corp need for an optically based small arms force-on-force training system, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Non-Imaging-optics Mobile Ballistic Line-of-sight Engagement (NIMBLE) system. The innovation in using non-imaging high bandwidth electro-optics module combined with GPS which is fused at central server via a wireless network will enable the system to provide an alternative to laser-based engagement systems. As a result, utilizing POC novel electro-optics and mature components, this system offers force-on-force engagement at greater than or equal to 375 m, enabling targeting of partially occluded targets, real-time casualty assessment while requiring lead aim for moving targets, barrel angle compensation for bullet drop, use of minimum appended equipment and munitions damage assessment models allowing for LVC interoperability, which directly address the requirements for force-on-force training. In Phase I, POC will perform feasibility demonstration of NIMBLE through design and laboratory testing of a prototype compatible with M16 and M4 using minimal appended equipment. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and validate a prototype system employing equipment in the fielding pipeline for demonstration with two squads and capable of expansion to 1000 users to prepare for Phase III transition to PM-TRASYS."

        "abstract": "Team CESI recently demonstrated the design and implementation of a laser-less system through accurate engagements at realistic ranges (out to 375 meters) using a cloud-based server architecture and a minimalist Marine-worn subsystem. We propose to continue to mature this proof-of-principle technology. To compensate for poor location and orientation sensor accuracy Team CESIs implementation of OBSAT captures the sight picture seen by the shooting Marine when the trigger is pulled. The reported position and orientation along with the captured sight picture are then used to accurately assess a target hit or miss to ranges at least as great as 375 meters. Throughout development the teams philosophy has been to use as much fielded or soon-to-be fielded equipment as possible. In this way the OBSAT technology points to a fieldable live, force-on-force training or testing capability that requires minimal or no appended hardware. The base Phase I effort focuses on integrating the M-203 grenade launcher into the OBSAT system. The optional Phase I effort uses a server-side algorithm to determine the location in which the target was hit. Depending on which region the round hit, a stochastic process will generate location-appropriate wound type and severity."

The current challenge is FAMMS is used to manage all aspects of fuel facility maintenance but the maintenance personnel must generate paper-based work-orders and job plans and the days work results must be manually entered in FMMS.The R&amp;D project is to develop a mobile platform that integrates with the Maximo based FMMS solution for data entry and record maintenance actions. The benefits will be a savings in an estimated thousands of hours per year NAVSUP-wide in data entry since the work data would be captured at the point of execution, and eliminate the need to print reams of paper each month.The potential commercial application is TRM sees a market need for a mobile solution for a Maximo Fuel Management solution. We are not sure yet how big the market is but any client who need to manage fuels, oils or liquids could benefit from the solution."

Based on the deep understanding of material physics for high frequency properties, and extensive experience in fabricating and supplying RF materials, Spectrum Magnetics proposes several material platforms featuring high magnetic permeability and permittivity. The innovative approach to fabricate flexible ceramic materials allows high concentration of magnetic constituent in composites, therefore retaining high magnetic permeability. The magnetic permeability and permittivity of the composites can be tailored to offer greater design flexibility in microwave devices. The composite materials are maritime compatible. The materials are designed such that industrial standard manufacturing practices can be used to shorten the time for commercialization."

In Phase I, we will demonstrate spin spray deposited low-loss ferrite\/insulator multilayers on large panel PCBs that can be scaled up to 48 48, and fabricate the integrated RF circuits and RF antenna circuits on PCB with superior RF performance. In addition, we will demonstrate the ability to develop and manufacture an RF material with an index of refraction greater than 10 at 2 GHz. In the end of Phase I, we will deliver a prototype sample of 12x 12, 100 grams of filler material, and a plan to scale up the materials manufacturing. In the subsequent Phase II, we will further refine the manufacturing technique and demonstrate consistent electrical properties, temperature range and environmental stability, and fully the scalability to 48 48 (4 ft x 4 ft) of material. We will also finalize the development including optimizations and scaling up, and work with an industry partner or a DoD prime contractor to develop processes so that the developed materials\/processing can be readily implemented on existing and future Navy assets with a potential large scale"

As technologies continue to evolve in communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, there is a growing wealth of information available to the commander. This abundance of information can be underutilized given the operational tempo. What is needed are command tools with capabilities that assist commanders with timely synthesis of information relevant to the decisions at hand, while minimizing the burden of distraction from excess information. We propose to build the Command and Control Assistant for Marine Commanders (C2-ASSIST), leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques currently used in digital assistants to assist commanders with battlespace decision making.The C2-ASSIST system will integrate with existing command tools and perform filtering, searching, and synthesis on large amounts of data. C2-ASSIST will find information relevant to current tasks and questions, predict impacts of the existing data on future plans, and automate complex tasks.During Phase I we will identify the requirements of the system to be built; define how C2-ASSIST will integrate with existing user interfaces and data sources; select the existing algorithms, tools, and libraries that will complete the required tasks and requests; develop and evaluate a prototype; and develop the Phase II system design."

However, current Command and Control (C2) systems overwhelm Commanders by presenting this data in too much detail, and they lack intuitive interfaces for exploring and querying the data. The resulting cognitive overload and inefficiency increases the risk that Commanders will overlook information critical to making the best decision. Commanders also lack tools that support their reasoning about predicted and hypothetical future situationstools that could enable them to evaluate potential courses of action (COAs) and ask what if questions. To address these problems, we propose to design a C2 Interactive and Context-Aware Digital Assistant (CICADA). CICADA enables Marine Corps Commanders to make sense of large amounts of operational data by issuing natural language commands. CICADA will convert speech input to machine-understandable queries, perform those queries against operational data sources, and return results at the appropriate level of detail. CICADA will be mixed-initiative, proactively issuing alerts to the user when it detects or predicts mission-critical events, and it will process queries about hypothetical and future scenarios to support what-if analysis and COA evaluation."

Seismic and acoustic sensors will be analyzed for detection performance in various operational environment to include rural and urban areas to ensure awareness of personnel movements to cover a 500 sq ft area. An analysis of predicted range\/sensitivity will be studied in order to determine operationally suitable employment. The effort will analyze new generation advanced data capture systems, ultra-low power microcontrollers, previous and new advanced detection algorithms, small low power comm modules (Bluetooth 4.0, Zigbee, et al) and smart phone or tablet sized controller for eventual incorporation with an android type device. Specifically, the effort will address known shortfall with previous systems in False Alarm Rate, low Probability of Detection, target discrimination, threshold\/sensitivity adjustment, power consumption, form factor, SWaP, complexity of employment, concealment, cyber protection, physical tamper and ease of use."

        "abstract": "The Marines seek the development of portable terrestrial sensor kit that allows up to 10 remote sensor nodes to wirelessly send footstep detection events to a central base station. The central base station is manned by a member of a tactical unit carrying a multipurpose tablet or PDA. The sensor system must be capable of operating for 7 days continuously and be rugged enough to survive the harsh battlefield environment. The objectives of the Phase I research is to conduct trade studies and perform design tasks for developing the small terrestrial sensor system. The study includes evaluating and selecting the various critical design elements and includes1.Evaluating and selecting an appropriate wireless network technology2.Specifying the Sensor Node hardware design3.Specifying the signal processing needs4.Developing the Base Station Architecture and components.5.Specifying the user interface and use casesThe Phase I proposal addresses the design trade-offs and technical considerations related to each of the above design elements. This includes evaluating the available technology and their impact on the system design. Upon completion of the Phase I, Adaptive Methods will have the necessary design work completed to construct an first article EDM."

        "abstract": "Small units are under constant threat of surprise contact with dismounted enemy forces. Small units need a reliable, low-latency, virtual trip-wire system to provide perimeter and area security. Existing systems are unsuitable. Generally, they were designed for the protection of larger installations or for use as remote intelligence assets. As a result, for small unit protection, they are too big, too heavy, and take too long to set up. Instead, the Marine Corps needs a small, ruggedized sensor that can be deployed under stressful conditions in total darkness by feel alone. Creares Intruder Alert (InAlert) system is dedicated to detecting intruders. It is a small, robust sensor whose detection algorithms are sensitive, specific, and completely automated. Simply stick it in the ground and continue the mission. Alerts are delivered reliably and with low latency to a standard Android device. In Phase I, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of the InAlert system in satisfying the Marine Corps requirements. In Phase II, we will fabricate full systems and demonstrate its performance under a range of conditions."
