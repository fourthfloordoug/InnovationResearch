        "abstract": "Recent advances in technology and global markets have driven down the cost and increased the availability unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Due to these changes in market conditions what was once the domain of only serious and experienced hobbyist has become a commodity item for casual consumers. With this sudden proliferation of highly capable airborne platforms new threats have arisen for both civilian and military facilities. These platforms have become an asymmetric threat being used for intelligence gathering; payload delivery; and other criminal and military purposes. Todays warfighters are in need of cost-effective, tactical, innovative systems to counter the small UAV threat.To address this Black River Systems proposes to design and prototype a tactical, tri-pod mounted counter small UAS system by leveraging our current experience in the C-sUAS space. We are currently working with both the Air Force and the Department of Homeland Security developing, testing and deploying open architecture government owned C-uUAS systems. We propose to focus on decreasing SWaP requirements for an integrated tactical UAS detection system and to add an Intent Algorithm Engine to infer a detected threats intent."

The technical approach is based on a novel tiled or mosaic substrate fabrication technique in which small, regular-shaped single-crystal diamond substrates are laterally arranged and overgrown to create large area single crystal electronic grade diamond substrates. The potential of the tiled or mosaic wafer concept has already been proven yet further advances in wafer size and electronic properties remain as primary engineering advancement opportunities. The proposed effort will use novel proprietary processes to extend the size of the mosaic wafers to 6 cm2 or larger while optimizing their electronic properties in terms of hole gas density and mobility. Success in the proposed effort will enable the first source of large area electronic grade diamond wafers, will set the stage for further increases in wafer size, and will position the US as a center of excellence in support the development of an entire new generation of ultra-high performance power and high speed electronic devices."

The proposed SBIR program will integrate multiple sensing techniques and devices into a single system to realize a robust target discrimination capability. The effort will quantify the reliability of the target discrimination when subjected to varying impact velocities and angles. The effort will also quantify the vulnerability to extraneous structures that may cause false triggers. The Phase I effort will investigate the performance of at least three target classification approaches and develop sensor fusion algorithms to provide a reliable target discrimination output. The Phase II effort would then prototype the multisensor approach and test under various impact conditions."

To achieve this goal, the technical objectives, the proposed MMD technology includes the following critical steps: 1) automate damaged feature extraction and alignment; 2) automate deposition process planning; 3) in-situ monitor and control the deposition process; and 4) use multi-wave energy source. The Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of steps 1, 2, and 4, while Phase I Option will demonstrate steps 1-4. Thus the resulting MMD process will have the following unique features: 1) Automated tool setup for restoration; 2) Precision powder feeding for precision restoration; 3) Robust metal additive process through in-situ monitoring; and 4) Multi-wave processing for reduced residual stresses in restoration."

        "abstract": "Recognizing the need for performing structural inspection of aerospace engine and airframes in a timely manner and yielding results with repeatable accuracy, Air Force is encouraging ideas for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) systems beyond the conventional eddy current, ultrasound, and penetrant dye techniques.  X-wave innovations Inc., proposes a novel portable, non-contact, non-intrusive, passive hyperspectral optics-based NDE system that can detect flaws of size as small as 5-mil with consistent accuracy.  The proposed system uses active thermography to raise the energy of the specimen, followed by hyperspectral thermal infrared (IR) imaging to detect cracks, defects, and other material flaws.  The key innovation is the integration of hyperspectral and hypertemporal imagery with a state-of-the-art digital image processing algorithm into one compact, stand-alone measurement device.  Whereas the optical nature of the proposed NDE allows for area scanning, thereby reducing the time of inspection and the manpower needed, the hyperspectral aspect allows for detecting structural defects as well as defects in the material composition with high sensitivity.  The successful completion of the HySpecNDE prototype will serve commercially wherever a failure of a hardware component would cause significant hazard or economic loss, such as in transportation, pressure vessels, building structures, piping, and hoisting equipment."

The new Lithium-based 6T battery packs will be used for automotive starting, lighting, ignition, and auxiliary electronics, which include engine off\/silent watch, and potentially other future applications within the Army and other branches of our military. The Lithium-based 6T battery pack specification, currently under development, is agnostic to cell chemistry and several manufacturers develop 6T battery packs following this specification with different cell chemistries. The Army is looking for a technology that will allow them to interconnect Lithium-based 6T battery packs in parallel and independently of chemistry in a flexible and efficient manner while gaining in performance and cycle life. X-wave Innovations Inc., and its partners propose a technology that accomplishes this tasks efficiently and regardless of chemistry in a way that minimizes size, weight, and uses lower power components when compared to conventional approaches. The use of lower power components results in a system having smaller impact on reliability and cost. The overall interconnected battery system combines unique algorithms and hardware that uses every pack and every chemistry to the best"

SAG combines multiple empirical models, including NRL-MSISE-00, URAP, NRL climatology, AFGL atmospheric profiles, SNOE databases, the International Reference Ionosphere, and photochemical and empirical models developed by Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI).  Together, this creates a complete picture of the atmospheric state for electro-optical\/infrared (EO\/IR) and radar (RF) systems as well as trajectory computations for targeting and tracking.  These systems and models required repeatedly refreshed data regarding local atmospheric conditions in an effort to interpret instantaneous measurements and predictively model the motion of threats and countermeasures.   SAG currently contains the necessary physics to support these applications but computational bottlenecks and serial code limit its performance.  We intend to first remove the I\/O performance bottlenecks and create thread-safe implementations of the underlying algorithms within SAG.  This will lead to a faster, more efficient model for use in digital simulations.  We will then port the most computationally expensive algorithms. The upgrades to SAG will allow real-time usage in digital and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) simulations.  It will be developed as an integrable module for MDA high-level architectures including the Objective Simulation Framework (OSF).  Approved for Public Release | 16-MDA-8917 (15 November 16)"

The current suite of plume modeling tools contains the basic framework for flowfield and signature generation, but lacks the underlying physical mechanisms and supporting property databases to properly account for alternate waveband regions. Recent efforts by Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI) used innovative computational chemistry techniques and laboratory data to generate a database of chemical rates among ro-vibrational state specific levels to extend the wavelength range of signature codes. The present approach develops and tests innovative procedures to compress the number of database states and rates, making routine applications possible. In Phase I, we will select one propulsion signature event observable, identify the phenomena to account for the complete process from combustion through signature emission, and prioritize the importance of each component as a function of altitude, velocity, and spectral band. We will focus on a single component, upgrade an existing government signature code, and demonstrate the methodology by applying the method to field data. In Phases II\/III, we will extend the method to other propulsion signatures, altitudes, and government signature codes.  Approved for Public Release | 16-MDA-8917 (15 November 16)"

        "abstract": "MDA Model and Simulation capabilities include Core Truth models  capable of simulating all physics governing missile detection, tracking and intercept events. A key component of the simulation tools is an accurate and fast atmospheric radiation model to describe the target signal propagation through the atmosphere to the sensor. Such a model should be designed to readily interface with existing scene generation tools, for example FLITES, to create Vis\/IR scenes. To support MDA operations, accurate Vis\/IR scenes will need to be generated in real time. To address this crucial need, Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop the Vis\/IR Atmospheric Tool (VISIRAT), a fast atmospheric effects module capable of computing lines-of-sight (LOS) radiances for use to create Vis\/IR scenes in real time.  VISIRAT will be based on the SAMM atmospheric radiance code. The development of VISIRAT will leverage the fast Radiative Transport (RT) modules in the latest version of SAMM: the correlated-k (cK) and the NLTE Band Model (BM) algorithms. The key enabling innovation to further accelerating the computations for scene generation is a response function approach to quickly compute the LOS radiance, based on the SAMM radiance gradient capability for simulation of atmospheric structure from temperature variations.

        "abstract": "This work addresses the design, development, and testing of a spectral sensor package, which can be inserted in the aft section of a re-entry vehicle (RV) to provide detailed spectral measurements of wakes and plumes. The resulting near-field spectral data will improve our understanding of the basic phenomena that impact performance and observability.  Insertion of the package within the RV allows the measurement of optical phenomena that cannot be observed from the ground, but imposes severe engineering constraints such as optical access, size, and limited telemetry.      Spectral Sciences proposes a rugged, miniaturized hyperspectral sensor package with high spectral and spatial resolution.  The packaged also contains a data processing system that samples critical spectral and spatial locations and reduces the data to a sufficient size that can be efficiently down-linked prior to loss of the test vehicle, while retaining key wake characteristics.  In Phase I, we will design the sensor and processing concept based on existing high-fidelity wake and plume signature models and the input of the RV prime and other experts and stake holders.  In Phase II, we will design and test a prototype system suitable for integration into an RV, fly-along sensor platform (FASP), or a rocket booster.

Under such high dynamic pressure and angle-of-attack (HDAOA) conditions, ablating heat shield material is entrained in the flow in the form of gases and particulates, and reactive chemistry between atmospheric and ablating species creates a complex, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) environment that can also ionize. All these effects have a strong impact on the vehicle electro-optic\/infrared and radar signatures, interfering with detection, tracking, targeting, and aim-point selection.  Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop innovative fast running HDAOA wake signature modeling tools.  In Phase I, candidate simulation methods will be assessed using SSIs existing high fidelity prediction tools to enable a practical and accurate simulation of the wake signature.  In Phase II, the prototype software will be fully developed.  The tool will be evaluated through comparison with high fidelity models and available measured data.  A plan to integrate the software into the Optical Signatures Code (OSC) will be developed and implemented.

The sensor uses translational and rotational scanning to sample beam profiles in polar coordinates. The optical detector modules are easily swappable to accommodate the UV (350-450 nm), visible (450-800 nm), NIR (1064 nm) and MWIR (3.6-6 m) bands, and laser line filters can be used to further specify the spectral range. For each set of detection modules, respective polarizing filters are set orthogonal to one another so that beam polarization can be determined from intensity ratio.\n\tWIMBLER self-adjusts to measure beams of different widths with no manual reconfiguration necessary. The range of motion is sufficient to accommodate &amp;gt;1 m diameter beams, to facilitate long range measurements. WIMBLER is portable enough to be transported for field measurements on a light truck. Control and data readouts are communicated wirelessly to the operator through an intuitive graphical interface. The readouts include a visual of the beam profile together with relevant spatial and temporal parameters, e.g. beam angle, calibrated intensity, polarization, and more.\n"

The trades will include variation of target material properties, focusing initially on the state-of-art calibration materials developed by Labsphere, Permaflect and Spectralon. The trade space will also include varying high contrast knife edge configurations which can be used to derive the spatial characteristics of the system under test across multiple spectral bands (visible, MWIR, and LWIR), investigation of techniques for quantifying spectral performance of multi- and hyperspectral imagers, and passive LOS measurement techniques for quantifying the effects of turbulence and visibility on spatial imagery.

Measuring the dark moonless night sky spectra at the required resolution is challenging due to the background noise produced from external thermal emissions. Spectral Sciences, Inc. is building a low noise spectrometer via an innovative use of waveband-dependent cold filters to eliminate out-of-band thermal noise. We propose developing the Sky Spectrometer and Radiometer (SkySR), a rugged and compact optical instrument for measuring spectral radiance and atmospheric temperature. SkySR combines an extremely low noise spectrometer with high dynamic range, enabling both daytime and nighttime spectral measurements with 8 nm or greater resolution in the VIS to SWIR wavebands. To fully characterize the observed radiance, SkySR measures apparent atmospheric temperature in the midwave and longwave for estimating the radiance contributions from atmospheric thermal emissions. A lightweight fieldable instrument for characterizing spectral sky backgrounds is well suited to support development of tactical equipment and other military and commercial needs such as supporting remote sensing simulations and field measurement campaigns."

        "abstract": "Integrated Solutions for Systems, Inc. (IS4S), with the Auburn University GPS and Vehicle Dynamics Lab (AU-Gavlab), will develop four complementary physics-enhanced navigation estimation algorithms. The Model-Based navigator combines the IMU measurements and actuator commands with a vehicle model. The Constraint-Based navigator applies artificial measurements during partially predictable periods of the missile flight. The IMM navigator merges component estimators into a single, improved navigation solution. The Hybrid navigator automatically selects the best navigators as the missile transitions between flight phases. These physics-enhanced navigators will be evaluated against traditional non-enhanced algorithms. The algorithms will augment the existing traditional navigators and should not appreciably increase SWAP-C requirements.    Representative missile models will be employed to generate parametrically varied trajectories with Monte-Carlo IMU error sets. The algorithms will also be interfaced with hardware IMUs as a proof-of-concept for implementation on missile systems.    The developed navigators will be applicable to a wide variety of missile systems and IMUs. The model parameters and constraints can be tuned to match the characteristics of particular missile systems while the sensor noise characteristics can be set to IMU parameters. As part of this effort, the system parameters which must be known will be identified and cataloged.  Approved for Public Release | 16-MDA-8917 (15 November 16)"

        "abstract": "The AACUS is a sensor suite and software package designed to operate an unmanned rotary wing aircraft into and out of an unprepared landing site. Installation of the AACUS applique in the UH-1H and UH-1Y aircraft enables fully autonomous unmanned flight and cargo deliveries. A properly designed Autonomous Cargo Handling System (ACHS) working in cooperation with an AACUS optionally piloted aircraft will speed cargo transport operations, protect warfighters and increase operational efficiency. To realize these benefits, an effective and efficient ACHS must meet a variety of loading, balance and structural challenges while remaining as lightweight as possible to preserve payload capacity. The autonomy, sensing and software must be robust enough to adapt to changing weather and lighting conditions as well as varying aircraft attitudes in flight and on the ground. Our proposed ACHS consists of three primary components: a) a robot capable of carrying JMIC and other standard cargo pallets as well as fuel and water, b) a retractable ramp system, and c) an automatic door actuation system."

        "abstract": "Testing of satellite navigation receivers and their associated antenna systems is a critical component of fielding new navigation equipment for the warfighter. Anechoic chambers and open-air test ranges are typically used to test these systems in benign environments and in the presence of electronic attack (EA). Anechoic chamber testing provides an environment with minimal background noise and interference, but lacks the realism provided by live-sky testing events. A need exists for an indoor, dynamic satellite constellation simulation to bridge a technology gap that exists between current anechoic chamber testing and live-sky testing of navigation systems against electronic warfare (EW) assets. Filling this gap will add a level of realism to existing chamber testing, while simultaneously reducing the demand on the low-density test ranges. To meet this critical need IS4S proposes a GPS satellite constellation simulator using a network of electronically scanned antenna arrays. This system will achieve non-static AOAs that accurately emulate the AOAs from the real-live sky constellation without any moving components. The proposed system will consist of several static antenna array panels installed in an anechoic chamber. Each array has a configurable phase pattern through adjustable phase delays to each element in the array."

(IS4S), with the Auburn University GPS and Vehicle Dynamics Lab (AU-Gavlab), will develop a Cruise Control Enhancement (CCE) which incorporates terrain and aerodynamic data to improve single vehicle and convoy fuel efficiency.Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Artificial Potential Fields (APF) will be employed to control speed and convoy spacing via throttle, brake, and gear actuators. MPC will incorporate a truck model which includes aerodynamic properties and terrain data in addition to traditional subsystems like engine and drivetrain. The MPC will optimize commanded inputs to maximize fuel efficiency while respecting safety and other hard limits. APF will guarantee safe spacing within the convoy. As the spacing approaches the safety threshold, the APF will create an artificial repulsive force to increase the spacing.The CCE will be evaluated in a high-fidelity simulation over a range of scenarios. The terrain, number of trucks, truck configuration, and nominal speed will be varied. The CCE will be configured to optimize both a single vehicle and the entire convoy with either a preset nominal speed or speed set by the lead vehicle. Additionally, the CCE will be implemented on trucks and initial validation and convoy demonstrations will be performed."

        "abstract": "Throughout history, airborne forces have given the United States military a significant tactical advantage with rapid deployment capability and little warning to opposing forces. Unfortunately, paratroopers often find themselves scattered across or even outside the intended drop zones. This forces the units to locate other squad members and equipment and regroup before they can proceed with their mission. This process must happen quickly in order for the airborne forces to maintain their tactical advantage of quick strike capability.Currently, airborne units rely upon GPS to navigate pre-defined waypoints to a pre-determined regrouping location(s). In todays battlefield, however, the warfighter faces the ever-increasing risk of operating in GPS degraded or denied environments. Operating in these environments causes significant delay to paratrooper operations as they must spend additional time to perform localization and regrouping.To meet this critical need, IS4S and team will develop an integrated, multi-sensor navigation system for paratrooper operations in GPS degraded environments. The navigation system solution will be a low size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP) solution that will utilize existing sensors, communication and network platforms that are either in service or currently in active development."

CREWS is envisioned as a software add-on capability to enhance existing EW systems such as SEWIP Block II and III. System interfaces will be isolated to a single interface library, lowering the costs associated with future transition to any platform. CREWS will contain specialized modules for performing cognitive processing. Each module will accept additional algorithms via a plug-in architecture as they are developed. A primary output of CREWS will be an automatically generated, highly descriptive WML representation of newly discovered emitter waveforms. The WML descriptions are input to the EA portion of the EW system, and provide enough information to support the creation and maintenance of emitter databases. Part of the design will include algorithms and techniques for determining higher order characteristics of the waveform such as function, mode, intent, hostility level, and agility capability."

        "abstract": "This SBIR proposes the development of algorithms, methods and devices used to adjudicate small-arms force-on-force training, with emphasis on proper marksmanship and the appropriate use of cover and concealment. We envision a solution with two components: a tiny camera unit for attitude and heading attached to the weapon rail or below the barrel, and a radio\/computer that houses all other electronics. Phase II research will explore the preferred location for these two components, as well as the optimal placement and packaging of the electronics. No bulky vests or harnesses, no heavy halos, increased accuracy and capabilities, with significantly reduced weight.The design baseline leverages the Tactical Engagement Simulation System (TESS), which has been in use with the US Army since 1998. TESS is a radio-based, collective, combined-arms weapons training system for aviation platforms, ground vehicles, and dismounted infantry, utilizing MILES Lasers and geometric pairing solutions. TESS employs high-rate data transmissions and can track multiple data aspects from each instrumented player to include position\/location, heading, attitude, sight orientation, weapon events, etc."

The underlying principle behind this approach was demonstrated by us earlier [Optics Letter, 30, 3012-3014 (2005)]. Briefly, we will split a beam from a master diode laser into multiple copies using angularly multiplexed gratings, written using light at 532 nm. These copies will then be used to injection-lock an array of diode lasers. Due to time reversal symmetry of Maxwells equations, the injection-locked beams, upon going back through the grating, will combine coherently, with the phase of each one properly adjusted, by using a PZT placed behind each laser. A beam splitter with a reflectivity of 95%, placed between the master laser and the grating, will redirect the combined beam as the output. We will use dye doped PMMA, which has vanishingly small absorption at 4.9 micron, as the holographic substrate. Under Phase I, we will develop a concrete design for the combiner, and demonstrate a proof-of-principle coherent combiner for 4 lasers at 4.9 micron wavelength. A full combiner with 36 lasers will be demonstrated in Phase 2, with a total power of ~144 W."

ATA will leverage its previous laser communication work and expertise in developing a 2.5kHz FSM. We intend to develop a new actuation approach utilizing existing hardware, including higher force actuators and low latency electronics to evaluate the highest risk technology. This approach provides the best opportunity to develop an actuator design which can meet the high torque needed for the higher bandwidth loop.

Our research and development will identify the areas that need to be addressed, propose and study alternative solutions, and provide simulated but relevant input to test our hypotheses against known CAC2S use cases. Our proposed technical solution is a modified version of Googles SyntaxNet and TensorFlow; an open-source AI framework that implements a feedforward neural network with a greedy transition-based parser. The open-source nature of those frameworks allows us to ultimately build an embedded AI system that can be installed on a classified CAC2S network without a connection to the Internet."

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, the systems engineering research community has spent significant effort targeting improvements in approaches for designers interested in trading between multiple competing objectives, such as mobility and survivability. Methods such as set-based design and tradespace exploration now leverage advanced optimization and analysis techniques, reducing computational and cognitive burdens on designers and analysts, while enabling the consideration of large potential design spaces. Making sense of the resulting large datasets is made possible through targeted use of abstraction, analysis, and automation. The degree of automation that can and should be leveraged when making tradeoffs varies based on the nature of uncertainties facing a given case. Acknowledging the power of an adaptive capability, instead of using a one-size fits all automated tradeoff approach, we propose an approach that can be tailored across an automation spectrum. Such tailoring allows for discovery of the impact different methods for combining and trading metrics have on the recommendation of best designs. Our proposed approach and tool, the Tailorable Tradespace Analysis of Mobility and Survivability for Ground Vehicles (TTAMS-GV), will provide new insights to ground vehicle designers that are robust to variations in mission needs, technologies, and priorities, common uncertainties faced during early design decision-making."

        "abstract": "Conducting operations in a Megacity will require new tactics involving cooperation with the local population. This necessitates gaining an understanding of the socio-cultural features of an area. The proposed TSUNAMI system will provide commanders with geographically referenced socio-cultural feature layers for publication on a Common Operational Picture display. These features will be derived from existing Civil Affairs data sources fused with open source data such as news feeds, Twitter, and Wikipedia. To achieve this, TSUNAMI will partition the city into a set of zones based on the existing spatial data. Textual data from the sources described earlier will then be processed by a novel, deep-learning based, Topic Modeling system. Each of the zones will be evaluated against the resulting topics. Each topics layer will be evaluated to determine how spatially relevant the topic is, and topics with high spatial relevance will be published to the Common Operational Picture. A spatial predictive model will also be run on these published layers to improve predictive accuracy and demonstrate the importance of these features."

Too often, when our countrymen are deployed, they are left guessing when and where their stuff is located. This makes it near impossible to adequately plan a mission, when the commander cannot be sure that they will be able to deliver a capability. The Transportation Exploitation Tool (TET) and Lifts of Opportunity (LOOP) applications look to bridge that gap by providing Sailors and Marines the ability to accurately and easily find connecting flights; however, those technologies are still at the mercy of the cargo while it is in transit. Of benefit to applications like TET or LOOP would be to know in advance what will require action. Tactical Edge is proud to propose a solution that will consume data from multiple authoritative data systems, identify relationships between that data, understand current location, apply rules and machine learning algorithms to predict arrival both prior to and during shipment, and provide a notification backbone with the ability to alert stakeholders with enough notice to expedite a late shipment or plan for alternative solutions with the intent to minimize impact to the warfighter."

        "abstract": "A primary obstacle that newly certified instructors face is the rapid transition to instructing military classes without previous extensive training in instruction and curriculum design. Existing training initiatives on teaching strategies are scarce and insufficient in identifying specific instructional strategies and competencies required to improve student learning outcomes. To accelerate the development of instructor mastery competencies, instructors require access to training tools that are accessible on-demand and support automatic real-time skill assessment and tailored training. In support of this requirement, Adaptive Immersion Technologies will develop a closed-loop recommender system for training content and instructor resources, in the form of a perpetually accessible, cloud-hosted, multiplayer online game environment. This mobile-accessible virtual schoolhouse will function to accelerate the mastery of executive-level instructor competencies and student learning outcomes. The system will draw from psychometric and neural computing concepts to support three interrelated capabilities: adaptive, simulation-based training with intelligent virtual student agents, crowd-sourced instructional content and resources, and a persistent instructor performance measurement capability and skill record. Together, these capabilities will provide a vehicle for on-demand, engaged, deliberate practice, and a framework for continuous evaluation and optimization of the integrated solution."

Unlike civilian career educators, military instructors are not often afforded the time or resources to fully develop their teaching skills prior to instructional duties. Design Interactive, Inc. proposes a computer-based training tool to accelerate instructor development using methods such as video-modeling and guided instruction both in and out of the classroom. Phase I will demonstrate capabilities for the Interactive Military Instructor Training and Assessment TEchnology (IMITATE), a platform facilitating development of effective training material to advance military instructors from novice to master level. IMITATE will: (1) support delivery of multiple training methods for maximizing instructor learning within our Prepare, Practice, Assess framework, (2) provide features for organizing digital assets for creating an archive of lessons from reusable content, (3) function from a flexible architecture that affords rapid adaptation for quick transition to new contexts, and (4) include an easy to use interface to support operational test\/evaluation, as well as ongoing research in evaluating the training methods and system deigns that most effectively expedite learning for novice instructors."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a high-G mechanical shock- and temperature-shock-tolerant oscillator as a replacement for quartz temperature-compensated crystal oscillators (TCXOs), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Ferroelectric Resonator Oscillator (FEROS). This proposed solution is based on a new design that utilizes mature POC-developed and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Specifically, the innovation in integration of a ferroelectric-based resonator with COTS oscillator circuitry will enable the FEROS to support precision frequency reference devices. FEROS offers performance comparable to quartz crystal devices, as well as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based devices, with small form factors and the ability to withstand the harsh environment of a high velocity, gun-launched guided projectile, which directly addresses the Hyper Velocity Projectile, SHD FY15-17, PEO IWS 3C Surface Gunnery Program requirements for high-G miniaturized GPS receivers. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of FEROS by developing a prototype design and measuring its performance metrics such as phase noise, jitter, and temperature dependence, at an anticipated TRL-4. In Phase II, POC plans to build a refined prototype device and characterize its frequency accuracy, temperature stability, phase accuracy, and temperature and shock capabilities; it will be delivered at TRL-5\/-6."

        "abstract": "Autonomous landing of a fixed wing Unmanned Air Vehicle on the deck of a moving ship requires a fast initializing, precise, and accurate ship-relative navigation solution able that is capable of functioning in emissions control scenarios (EMCON). Current state-of-the-art landing systems rely on RF emissions and are therefore inoperable in EMCON or are subject to the availability of a specific RF spectrum. The proposed RAIN-LANDR system is designed to provide fully EMCON compliant, continuous, high integrity range and bearing data for unmanned or assisted approach and landing. RAIN-LANDR leverages and integrates aircraft fast initializing pose estimation and navigation filter modules developed by SSCI to provide high accuracy precision ship-relative navigation data. High intensity, visible light beacons placed on the ship extend the range of operations and speed-up pose estimation, ultimately contributing to fast filter convergence. The objective of the Phase I effort will be the development of the RAIN-LANDR system concept, validation in simulation studies using physics-based renderings with accurate light source modeling. The Phase I effort will provide a solid foundation for the implementation and demonstration of an integrated system in Phase II."

        "abstract": "In this SBIR effort a small business company Torrey Pines Logic proposes to develop and implement a novel Ship Relative Instant Multispectral Positioning System (SHRIMPS) for rapid initialization and real time acquisition of relative pose for navigation inputs to the flight control system based on infrared multispectral guidance and novel electrooptic sensors with the goal of meeting the challenging Navy requirements for fully automated landing of the fixed wing aircraft on an aircraft carrier. The selection of eye safe infrared wavelength band around 1.5 microns for the system operation minimizes the risks for the pilots, maximizes signal-to-noise ratio due to lower solar background, expands the system reach due to lower scattering in the atmosphere and allows for the overall system cost reduction due to the use of readily available components from developed industry of optical communications. In Phase I, we will determine the feasibility of rapidly initializing detection, tracking and relative pose estimation through concept modelling and breadboard prototype testing. In Phase II the team will develop and implement sensor processing for real time PS-PN capability and demonstrate the system performance in a variety of simulated sea and atmospheric conditions with open loop demonstration of the PS-PN capability in flight."

        "abstract": "The U.S. Navy requires a robust oscillator replacement for quartz crystal temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO). Most systems rely on a single quartz oscillator for timekeeping during such events. Quartz oscillators are very useful in this capacity and have superior electrical properties to other technologies, such as stability and phase noise. However, quartz is very sensitive to mechanical stock and rapid temperature changesespecially when used in high-velocity gun-launched guided projectiles. Due to shortcomings in harsh environments, a reliable and robust time and frequency source alternative is needed to sustain operation for mission-critical navigation and communication systems.Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) oscillatorsalthough still in their developmental infancyhave similar beneficial electrical properties to quartz. However, MEMS are less susceptible to damage due to mechanical shock and\/or temperature extremes than quartz primarily due to lower mass and different material properties. This makes a temperature-compensated MEMS oscillator (TCMO) a very attractive option for gun-launched projectiles, such as the Navys Hypervelocity Projectile.NuWaves Engineering, along with academic subcontracting partner, the University of Virginia (UVA), propose the High-Shock MEMS PREcision FrEquency Reference (PREFER) project to develop a state-of-the-art MEMS oscillator by leveraging the Teams expertise in advanced MEMS design and fabrication, oscillator and RF module design, development, manufacturing and testing."

        "abstract": "Military instructors do not have the time or support necessary to achieve mastery or even ensure continued professional development during their tenure as instructors. Teaching skill must develop to adequate levels in the early months of the typical three-year tenure and continue to grow and progress after initial formal training. Each formal school in the Marine Corps has a unique method of initial preparation of new instructors, but none have sufficient time and resources to formally provide instructors with sustainment or enrichment training to continue and accelerate development during their tenure. Advanced instructional techniques that support the students in deep understanding, flexible application of knowledge, and critical thinking skills are necessary to meet operational demands for adaptive application of knowledge across dynamically changing operational environments. CPG proposes to produce the Accelerated Instructor Development (AIM) System to support current Marine Instructor Training &amp; Readiness standards (2015). A problem-based learning approach will inform the design of context-based training and practice, informed by the detailed developmental roadmap found in the CPG Instructor Mastery Model from which the current Marine standards were drawn. The system will provide individual lessons accessible by tablet and the internet."

        "abstract": "Military operations and logistics are inextricably linked. The importance of In-Transit Visibility (ITV) capability for reliable tracking and delivery of logistical items has well been recognized across Department of Defense (DoD) logistics programs. The current state-of-the-art solution to ITV employs a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) network, which comprises a large number of read-and-write stations and hence requires high cost and intensive manpower. Motivated by past experiences on air traffic management and machine learning, Optimal Synthesis Inc. (OSI) proposes an alternative approach that exploits existing variety of data sources, a good example of which is the IDE\/GTN Convergence (IGC) that is a unified data service across DoD cargo movement and tracking. The approach combines machine learning techniques with the estimation and prediction methodologies for tracking the cargo movement and predicting the time-of-arrival in each mission leg. By performing on-line risk monitoring, a decision support tool that generates automated alerts for human intervention is also developed using a stochastic decision framework. The proof-of-concept demonstration is planned in Phase I, and the software prototype is planned to be developed in Phase II for functional demonstration."

        "abstract": "Modus Operandi proposes an innovative Semantically Enhanced Analytic Transportation Exploitation Tool (SEATET) for In-Transit Visibility (ITV) accessible via mobile devices. SEATET will provide a state of the art logistics ITV capability that better integrates various kinds of data and provides cargo transport situational awareness and decision support to Naval Lifts of Opportunity (LOOP) planners. SEATET identifies patterns of interest that inform and improve the ITV of goods managed in the existing TET system for urgent cargo logistics. SEATET captures important metadata in ontology models that provide a means to integrate and query across multiple legacy logistics systems via a common data model, plus provide outreach to other existing data sources currently unavailable to TET (weather data, equipment data, mission data, etc.). SEATETs rules-engine automates several of the current processes within TET, reducing errors, improving communication capabilities among users, and providing alerts regarding risks or impacts to the cargo transport. SEATET builds upon Modus Operandis proven MOVIA analytics platform, which will be enhanced to handle large-scale logistics scenarios and will also require R&amp;D around domain-specific ontology models for particular logistics applications. Using APIs, SEATET provides connectivity other legacy software tools connecting Naval data across the enterprise."

        "abstract": "Continuing development and integration of high power electronics devices with smaller footprints, higher power densities, electronic propulsion, weapon, and sensor systems, requires efficient thermal management strategies. The US Navy has identified two-phase cooling systems as a viable candidate approach for heat removal from for such devices that can experience high power electronics loads during pulsed operations. DynSAN proposes to develop an innovative, fast and efficient software toolkit for the design and optimization of two-phase thermal management in current and future warships. For design efficiency, the toolkit will allow parametric specification of heat exchanger layout and will account for differences in heat transfer coefficients induced by placement orientations and variable body forces due to wave action. It will also allow the minimization of component and system weight and volume. Multi-resolution simulations will allow system-level analysis with selective focusing on component-level dynamics. For example, the approach will allow detailed (2D-3D) CFD simulations of warship interior and variable-fidelity (1D) reduced model simulations in the cooling system flow loop. Controller design will allow for the optimal selection of control strategy to maximize the heat rejection process. The key innovative features of this our approach include the use of co-simulations to couple the dynamics of the different system components at selected resolutions and the innovative Modified State Observer (MSO) adaptive controller, capable for compensating for the controlled system uncertainties."

Traditional flywheels are heavy with low tip speeds and often have to be built in place. Creare proposes an advanced carbon nanotube (CNT) flywheel for shipboard pulsed power applications. This flywheel will use state-of-the-art CNT yarns and tapes along with other materials to reduce weight and increase tip speed. During Phase I, we propose to conduct coupon testing of the CNT material, design the advanced flywheel, and conduct initial fabrication and testing of miniaturized high-risk components. In Phase II, Creare proposes to design, fabricate, and test a scaled prototype flywheel demonstrating tip speed in excess of 1000 m\/s."

Multiple megawatts of power are required to fire a railgun at full force, which can put a heavy strain on a given ship&apos;s onboard power generation systems. One of the most promising enabling technologies for power storage is high-energy storage flywheel systems. San Diego Composites, Inc. (SDC) proposes to improve the interlaminar z-strength of a filament wound composite flywheel (FWCF) through SDCs technology for Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) alignment, and to improve the hoop strength of a FWCF by winding with high strength nano-based materials.

        "abstract": "The introduction of USN electric ship initiatives and advanced weapons systems such as rail guns, lasers, and other future pulse loads to future warships creates power and energy demands that exceed what a traditional ship electric plant interfaces have been designed to provide. This creates the problem of satisfying a growing demand for stored energy, while working within the limited space available aboard ship platforms. Gloyer Taylor Laboratories LLC (GTL) KineticCoreTM Flywheel Energy Storage (K-FES) system designs are a tailor made solution to address this USN stored energy demand. Not only does the HAZMAT free K-FES rotor have many of the traditional flywheel advantages, but it goes beyond into the next generation of optimized, all composite flywheel design. But, in even the best flywheel designs, material strength is what ultimately limits future performance gains. Therefore, GTL proposes exploring Carbon Nanotube (CNT) based additives to augmenting its KineticCore flywheel to improve the next generation of energy storage. Theoretical and early experimental CNT augmented carbon composite materials have demonstrated 8%-33% increased strength for a 1%-3% net weight of added CNT materials. Experimentally exploring these laboratory findings and incorporating the results into an improved K-FES design are the objectives of this proposed effort."

        "abstract": "BlueRISCs proposed solution takes the form of a binary-level toolkit whose goal is to create implicitly brittle software with fast crash properties. The approach performs static analysis at the binary-level (i.e. no source code required) as well as associated transformations aimed at breaking fundamental assumptions regarding inter-procedural data flow as well as code layout and control-flow. These techniques are coupled with the proposed fast-crash decoy codes and flow check codes which are strategically inserted at places in the binary upon launch to enable timely control-flow change to a handler upon software crash, minimizing the time-to-crash. This concept of transforming a binary, both statically as well as dynamically, to implicitly break the assumptions required by an attacker for exploitation and enable a timely, implicit detection is the backbone of the proposed brittle software creation solution."

        "abstract": "The introduction and utilization of modern weapon systems on shipboard platforms demands new high energy storage capacity devices with rapid charge\/discharge capacities. Flywheel-based systems are particularly attractive for this purpose due to their high fatigue life, reliability, high efficiency and rapid rate of discharge. However, one of the main factors limiting the energy storage capacity of a flywheel is the mechanical stresses developed in the flywheel rotor due to centrifugal forces and inertia effects, which can lead to structural failure. Therefore, introducing materials to flywheels with high specific strength, such as carbon fiber reinforced composites and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), will enable higher tip velocities and thus higher energy storage capacity. For example, by utilizing the increased strength of CNTs, a ~12 improvement in energy density is possible over state-of-the-art graphite composite flywheels. To address the solicited DoD need for advanced shipboard energy storage solutions, PM&amp;AM Research, in collaboration with Texas A&amp;M University, propose to develop a novel hybrid CNT-based flywheel energy storage system for pulse power applications. This innovative approach will improve energy storage capabilities beyond state-of-the-art systems. Through design optimization, the hybrid flywheel will exhibit improved strength, safety, and energy-storage by cost-effectively achieving higher speeds."

        "abstract": "CU Aerospace (CUA), teamed with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), proposes to research, develop, and demonstrate thermal management simulation tools for next-generation two-phase cooling systems designed for transient high heat-flux naval applications. The software developed in this program can be used to evaluate advanced thermal management designs for critical emerging naval electronics applications (e.g. radar, railguns, and directed-energy). The improved heat transfer, increased power density, and reduced packaging size achievable with two-phase designs are advantageous when compared to single-phase cooling (e.g. water flow). However, active control features are required to address temperature variation, thermal lag, flow instabilities, and critical heat flux not found in current state-of-the-art single-phase systems. Addressing this, the proposed program introduces innovative tools for simulating two-phase systems which can serve as an industry standard for evaluating and optimizing naval thermal management designs. Phase I efforts will focus on component model development and preliminary experimental validation, serving as a basis for advanced multiple-cold-plate architecture pursued in Phase II. The toolset produced in this program will have major implications for the future designs of two-phase thermal management systems in warships, offering a comprehensive approach for reducing size, weight, and power consumption, while improving thermal load handling."

Selection of appropriate applied levels architecture will be dependent on the desired target application. Emphasis will be placed on developing a flexible computational framework that incrementally learns optimal parameters and discerns parameter sets that lead to degradation profiles.During Phase I we will develop an approach for a Reliability-Centered AM Computational Design Framework (RCAM CDF) focused on selective laser melt (SLM) AM processes for metallic components. This design framework will initially include minimum part geometry for a load bearing coupon structure, with defect types and densities induced by design of the AM build fabrication process, followed by laser Computed Tomography (CT) inspection of the components, with subsequent in situ structural monitoring sensors (corrosion, strain) to record the accelerated lifetime and fatigue testing."

        "abstract": "Specific mission requirements exist for certain types of critical cyber systems that demand for the software to fail\/crash, as soon as possible, when under cyber-attack, rather than to operate in degraded or compromised state. In order to achieve this objective, BRASS offers novel binary code randomization approach that addresses these requirements in two phases: (1) a static phase that transforms a target binary into randomizable form, and (2) a load-time phase that randomizes the binary by reordering its instructions each time it starts. BRASS applies these techniques in order to achieve fast-crash property of guaranteed prompt execution termination in case of successful ROP-based exploitation attacks that cause compromised software to operate in unsafe state. BRASS does not require a source code, and can be applied to a legacy software already deployed by DoD. BRASS provides a proof of functional equivalence for all software variants generated using BRASS binary transformation method. BRASS guarantees accomplishes acceptable size overhead and no degradation in system performance. Each generated variant maintains the same level of robustness as the original program under normal condition. BRASS provides the level of diversification sufficient to guarantee that the attack that succeeded in a single variant, will crash other variants."

        "abstract": "To address U.S. Navy needs, Sentient proposes to establish a Design Framework for reliability assurance of additive manufactured (AM) parts using their DigitalCloneTM Component (DCC) software. The framework will be tailored to metal components built through AM processes with complex geometries. Sensors are embedded during AM component build to allow for exploitation of sensor data, physics-based material models, and Bayesian-based algorithms for measurement and operational uncertainty management. Computational material model(s) virtually serialized to each AM part are regularly updated to best capture current health state and adaptively assess reliability. Sentients Design Framework allows for inclusion of life-cycle forecasts during the creation and exploration of the AM design space. In the Phase I, coupon samples with embedded sensors are built and modeled in the DCC framework for validation against physical testing results. A Bayesian-based algorithm for information fusion will be used to validate dynamic fatigue assessment capability for AM part reliability assurance. In Phase II, the framework will be expanded to different AM material processes with more complex geometries and loadings. It will include Multi-Objective Optimization tools for use in design, and reliability monitoring of a small air-to-air heat exchanger with forecasting of life-cycle and performance metrics compared to costs."

The OASIS Team proposes to conduct a detailed feasibility study of using passive array(s) with integrated signal processor(s) to detect, classify and track, in real time, the underwater radiated noise of intruder UUVs. The requirement for the system will be a detection range of 1 km with a false alarm rate of 1 per day. In Phase I, possible intruder source levels will be estimated, as well as ambient noise and propagation appropriate for harbor environments. We will tradeoff the system performance (detection range, array gain, beam width, number of sensor channels, etc.) with frequency, cost, response time, array type and placement in the harbor. Existing and new array designs will be evaluated as well as various concepts of operation. A preliminary design for the system will be developed and documented for Phase II proof-of-concept testing. With extensive experience in designing, building, and testing high resolution passive arrays integrated with signal processors on board UUVs for the successful ONR PLUS and Marine Mammal Monitoring programs, the OASIS Team is uniquely qualified for this project."

The design will include fully documented assumptions and identify areas of highest technical risk. The Phase I Option includes provision for initial mitigation of the most significant of these risks. Although initially targeted at SSPs current WQX program, the techniques identified and proposed by NDI in this SBIR will be applicable to all similar sensors and will provide additional utility that will increase overall system performance. The work identified under Phase I (and its subsequent option) will set out a development framework that allows for low-risk incremental capability delivery that gives rapid, tangible, enhancements to existing systems at the earliest opportunity."

Emphasis will be placed on reducing noise caused by breathing apparatus and communication system noise and on developing a complementary high fidelity simulation model. The measured signals will be used in a simulation of the ANC system to indicate the achievable active attenuation at the divers ears and the potential of ANC for diving helmet noise reduction. The base and option tasks include: 1) Simulation model and control of breathing apparatus noise, 2) Control of communication channel feedback loop noise, 3) Finite Element model of dive helmet acoustic dynamics, and 4) Investigate optimal ANC component locations.In Phase I, a premier team with extensive expertise in active noise control, testing, Finite Element modeling and master diving will instrument and measure exterior and interior noise signals in a dive helmet during underwater high noise operating conditions. The data will be processed and used to develop an simulation model of the ANC system. The model will be exercised to optimize the ANC system for maximum noise reduction in the helmet. Finite Element models will be created and used for preliminary investigations of the acoustic dynamics of the dive helmet interior. Optional tasks include developing a simulation model of in wire ANC of background noise on diver communications."

One obvious modality to consider is mid-to-high frequency active acoustics in the 30-120 kHz range.

        "abstract": "The utilization, and thereby, threat of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) is experiencing a significant increase throughout the world. UUVs can be used to track vessels, covertly map ports, and attack targets. UUVs are inherently quiet targets making them difficult to track via traditional acoustic methods. To counter the threat presented by covert UUV activities, other detection and tracking methods are needed. Nokomis Hiawatha detection, identification, and geo-location system leverages the electromagnetic fingerprint of targets produced by electronics onboard to provide critical information regarding potential threats. All electronic system components create electromagnetic emissions which can be detected from long range with a sensitive RF front end and advanced signal processing methods. UUVs are especially susceptible to detection via electromagnetic detection when surfacing to obtain a GPS fix or to relay data. Once detected, the specific features in the emission spectrum provide a way to identify the type of threat and allow individual UUVs to be tracked within a cluttered environment. The incorporation of a system-controlled camera allows for visual identification and tracking of any identified targets as well as the ability to exclude any surface vessels that are not of interest."

        "abstract": "Voice communication with military divers is challenged by their extreme operating environment and limited by inadequate performance from their legacy communications equipment. Bottomside, the divers are subject to extreme pressures, mixed breathing gases, and high ambient noise. Clean pickup and delivery of voice would be challenging under these conditions even with ideal communications equipment. Unfortunately, the equipment itself is contributing to the communications difficulty. The legacy components often have inadequate frequency response, the long copper cable tether is subject to corrupting cross talk, and the open-loop nature of 4-wire communications often results in confounding echo and painful audio feedback. Creare proposes to develop its HYDAC upgrade package for the legacy diving communication system. The HYDAC package is a collection of modular upgrades that address the deficiencies of the legacy system, provide forward-looking advanced capabilities, while also maintaining full backward compatibility."

        "abstract": "High Power Microwave (HPM) sources are readily available which can generate high energy microwave pulses which can disable or damage electronic systems. These attacks occur without an explosion or any other type of external indication, thus knowing an attack has occurred requires a dedicated sensor to provide warning prior to a disable\/damage event. Specific platforms that are especially vulnerable are low flying rotorcraft, ground and surface vessels, and even military and government complexes. To address this need, SA Photonics has developed our Wideband Agile Threat Sensor (WATS). The system consists of multiple completely passive HPM probes connected by fiber optic cable to an electronic processing system. Our HPM probe possesses wide frequency range, excellent low end sensitivity to detect weak HPM, and an extremely high damage threshold. Our electronic receiver utilizes our wideband compressive sensing receiver technology that allows the entire frequency range to be sensed instantaneously, with no scanning time and no possibility of missed signals. In addition, the receiver is able to detect very narrow impulse signals that would be missed by envelope detection approaches. All signal characteristics are maintained allowing for full signal characterization to be performed as well as TDOA based source localization algorithms."

The thickness of the copper coating and the diameter of the substrate fiber can be tuned to yield optimized chaff with high Radar Cross Section (RCS). Simulations and single fiber lab measurements indicate that the proposed copper coated CF (Cu\/CF) provide 6.5X extinction compared to the current aluminum on glass (Al\/SiO2) chaff at 35 GHz. PSI will convert this batch process to a roll to roll (R2R) pilot production system that will copper coat continuous CF tows. The CF tows will be laser cut to the target resonant length corresponding to 2 and 150 GHz frequencies. On the Phase I program, we will fabricate a small scale continuous process to demonstrate Cu\/CF production and to provide chaff for characterization. Our partner, Prof. Charles Bruce at New Mexico State University, will provide chaff RF characterization. As part of a Phase I Option we will deliver laser cut Cu\/CF packed in RR-129 cartridges to our partner, Esterline Defense Technologies, for dissemination testing. During the Phase II program, we will construct and optimize a pilot production system to produce 1 kilogram per hour of the Cu\/CF."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for high radar cross section (RCS) chaff for operation in the millimeter wave frequencies, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Graphite Fiber Dipole Chaff (GFDC). This proposed chaff is based on commercially available, inexpensive metal-coated graphite fibers. Specifically, the innovation in manufacturing technology and dense chaff packaging will enable its efficient dissemination, producing a dipole cloud with a RCS exceeding 500 m^2. The GFDC will provide platform protection within the frequency range from 33 GHz to 38 GHz with the potential to extend protection to lower frequencies. It will be fully compatible with existing chaff dispensing systems. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology by fabricating chaff elements, estimating the RCS of the dipole cloud, and demonstrating efficient dispersion of dipole elements without agglomeration. In Phase II, POC plans to mature the manufacturing process and fabricate full-scale chaff prototypes for flight testing at a Navy test range. These flight tests will elevate the GFDC to TRL-7."

C3Is Configurable Distributed LED Driver (CD-LD) technology will meet the LFCM requirements, providing performance enhancements and resulting in significantly reduced installation, operating, maintenance, and configuration costs. The development of the CD-LD technology will enable installation of LED drivers in proximity to the LED fixture, reducing the requirement for expensive home run cable installations with the ability to upgrade existing LED lighting with new and\/or improved LED technology without the requirement to replace\/upgrade the driver hardware. The CD-LD technology will provide the ability to re-configure installed power lines to implement sophisticated device control and power delivery to an LED fixture without the need to re-wire legacy ships. This Phase I effort will address initial design and development of the CD-LD technology, and include a feasibility demonstration of core device and system technologies. Phase II will involve creation of the full scale CD-LD implementation, provide draft specifications for the technology, and provide evaluation\/refinement of device\/system capabilities. No similar technology is available today."

        "abstract": "The Navy has developed an Advanced Flight Deck Lighting (AFDL) solution for DDG-1000. The AFDL is comprised of a suite of Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lights powered and controlled from lighting device drivers called &quot;FLEXDRIVERS.&quot; The control panel communicates commands to the FLEXDRIVERS over a network. The FLEXDRIVERS are in a centralized location away from the lights. Each FLEXDRIVER must be individually configured with a unique mix of multiple driver cards for the specific light fixtures it powers and controls. Each light has a direct connection to the FLEXDRIVER which results in a cumbersome cabling arrangement with a large amount of cable. Our proposed solution is to connect universal light drivers to each light. The power for the universal light driver will come from a dedicated ship&apos;s vital 115VAC circuit. The control signal will be delivered via a daisy-chained RS-485 cable. The benefit of our universal light driver system for AFDL is a reduction of cabling with an associated reduction in cost and weight. An LED light driver that uses 115VAC power and RS-485 control signals at the light location will allow for installation of specialized LED lights in places where previously their installation wasn&apos;t practical."

        "abstract": "As U.S. military emphasizes Information Dominance and advanced Command, Control, Communications &amp; Intelligence capabilities in its operation, smart lighting control for specific applications and environments, including lighting for surface aviation and amphibious assault ships launch and recover aircraft whose pilots typically use Night Vision Devices for night operations, becomes increasingly important as an integral part of the operation. Digitally addressable control of the lighting fixtures and associated circuits, for example, abroad the NVD flight deck is required in order to dim and\/or turn the lights on and off. Control of this lighting is a critical operations factor. A new solution is needed for aviation lighting aboard air capable ships utilizing LED technology through a standardized smart module that will be able to recognize the lighting package configuration and what type of light fixture it is controlling through embedded firmware\/software; this would allow lights of different functions and power requirements to be daisy chained, significantly reducing cable runs and installation costs. We propose to develop a comprehensive smart module solution that allows for the lights to self-configure and appear on the operator control panel in the correct lighting group as well as support dimming and flashing modes and auto-identify\/configure capabilities."

When mounted on conducting groundplanes, they do not suffer gain-bandwidth degradation like conventional metal-and-dielectric antennas. Their immunity to the image effect means that frequency independent and self-complementary MFC antennas conformal to a ground-plane should be able to attain the same bandwidth attained in free space by classic spiral and log periodic antennas. The proposed program will demonstrate the feasibility of realizing inherently broadband magnetic flux channel antennas by: 1) implementing MFC antennas in frequency-independent geometries, and 2) developing methods for making MFC antennas conformal to curved surfaces."

This proposed device is based on a new conformal loop geometry that uses COTS moldable ferromagnetic material that is embedded with electrically-insulated iron particles that exhibits high magnetic flux, low-loss characteristics and allows it to be easily fabricated into a curved magnetic flux channel antenna that will extend the Navys communication capabilities. Specifically, the innovation in the geometry design of the antenna will enable the device to radiate effectively and efficiently on a curved surface with frequency-independent characteristics in impedance and radiation pattern. As a result, POC anticipates broadband frequency range (HFUHF), gain greater than 0 dBi, and VSWR better than 2.5:1 across the frequency range, directly addressing the Navy requirements. In Phase I, POC will perform tradeoff analysis to meet performance requirements and demonstrate the feasibility of COMBA through simulation, design, and prototype testing of an antenna. In Phase II, POC plans to further develop a COMBA prototype, improving SWaP, frequency range, and to conduct simulations on a modeled aircraft to prove its mission worthiness."

        "abstract": "Low cost and high capacity make lithium sulfur batteries (LSB) the next generation of lithium ion batteries. Practical application of LSBs remains limited by low utilization of sulfur and fast capacity fading of sulfur cathodes. The root causes are poor electronic conductivity of the cathode combined with high solubility of intermediate polysulfide products formed during cycling. To overcome these limitations Navitas proposes a new conductive nano-porous ceramic host material for LSB cathodes. This novel composition will provide high affinity to both non-polar sulfur and polar polysulfides. To enhance LSB performance and life: (1) nanoporous structure accommodates sulfur volume change during cycling; (2) mechanical strength and conductivity enables high utilization of sulfur; and (3) high affinity to both sulfur and polysulfides minimizes sulfur dissolution. Phase I will validate the cathode in laboratory prototype full cells. In Phase II, pilot scale electrode coating and cell assembly will be developed to support delivery of at least five prismatic pouch cells &gt;6Ah and &gt;600 Wh\/kg. The proposed LSB technology will reduce battery size and cost by 50% vs lithium ion. Applications include most military and consumer devices operating on lithium ion batteries. With improved safety characteristics, aviation applications will be the initial target market."

        "abstract": "The energy needs of naval aircraft are increasing significantly as the Navy modernizes its fleet. Current lithium-ion cells are insufficient for meeting these requirements. Li-air chemistry has the potential to meet the Navys energy demands. However, the state-of-the-art non-aqueous Li-air cells suffer from sluggish charging kinetics, clogging of mass transfer pathways and high resistance originating from the discharge product of Li2O2 at the cathode. An advanced cathode with low overpotential, high reversibility and good cyclability is needed to produce the Navys required gains. Lynntech proposes to develop an advanced hierarchical cathode based on two-dimensional holey graphene and hybrid metal oxide bifunctional catalysts to enable high energy, high power, and long cycle life Li-air batteries. During the Phase I, Lynntech will prepare, characterize, and evaluate advanced cathodes at the full cell level. In addition, Lynntech will perform a critical safety and electrical performance evaluation of Li-air cells. During the Phase II, Lynntech will optimize the cathode materials and structures to develop a prototype Li-air battery and determine performance characteristics. Lynntech will also initiate scale-up and design processes as well as develop preliminary cost structure."

Our objective is to assess the feasibility of: 1. preprocessing the SAR images with the model-based HDVI super-resolution imaging and the RDRTec full spectrum analyzer (FSA) algorithms to reduce speckle noise, scintillation effects, and background normalization; 2. assessing the performance of the baseline JHU\/APL SAR-based detector against the preprocessed SAR images in terms of Pd\/Pfa; 3. exploiting models of multipath effects and K distributed sea clutter on low altitude sea surface targets and assessing their effects on detection performance in terms of Pd\/Pfa; and 4. fusing the micro-Doppler features with the SAR-based detections to reduce the Pfa. This capability will be incorporated as an upgrade to the APS-153 radar surveillance mode on the MH-60R and potentially to the currently funded Radar Collision Avoidance System (RACAS) under development by ONR and NAVAIR as a Sense and Avoid (SAA) initiative for transition into the MQ-8 and MQ-4."

        "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the ability to detect and discriminate slow moving (= 10 knots) low radar cross section (RCS) objects such as small surface vessels and surface signatures in maritime environments at low-to-mid grazing angles. The physical mechanisms for detection and discrimination are made possible by the combination of coherent and non-coherent scatting phenomenology associated with the surface target direct and multipath interaction with clutter that is captured by the SAR imaging process. The detection and discrimination processing can be embedded in the SAR image processing by exploiting synthetic sub-apertures that can be used to construct the overall synthetic aperture coherently. It is essential to note that the synthetic aperture (or sub-aperture) process is a coherent Doppler domain process and it is in the Doppler domain where the detection and discrimination signal processing function is implemented. Unfortunately, SAR spotlight operation has very little search rate to be of practical use and SAR strip map (or push broom) operation has relatively low search rates in comparison to scanning radars. LSI recommends and proposes a research effort that evaluates the signal processing that performs the detection and discrimination using SAR strip map data and extends these capabilities for use with scanning coherent surface search mode operation for significant improvement in search rate that will also enable subsequent feature aided tracking."

        "abstract": "Leveraging WW Technology Groups Reliable Platform Service architecture, this effort will demonstrate the ability to utilize an abstraction layer and maintain a true real-time processing environment using the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) standard. A mature highly dependable, real-time architecture approach will mapped to the FACE abstraction layers and interfaces. Roadblocks to full FACE conformance and potential mitigations will be identified. The resulting architecture can be utilized as a host architecture\/framework for next generation Mission Processing and\/or Jet Engine controls. Furthermore, the integration of these innovative low-cost faults tolerant services will be added into a FACE compliant processing model. These additions will provide a rigorous test case to benchmark and access the capability and flexibility of the layered FACE architecture. Successfully extending these services into the most demanding areas of fault-tolerant system design will provide enhanced FACE platform capabilities for distributed processing architectures requiring real-time performance and fault tolerance."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for miniaturized, fault-tolerant, decentralized mission processing, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop the new Joint Avionics Reconfigurable Virtual Information System (JARVIS). JARVIS incorporates POC-developed components and existing commercial\/modified off-the-shelf components synthesized to form an innovative miniaturized system construct. JARVIS offers superior fault tolerance and decentralizes aircraft mission processing to exceed the Navy requirements. In its operational state, JARVIS is envisioned as decentralizing mission data processing across several fully capable distributed processing nodes, with reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP), increased interface speeds, and lower costs, compared to current monolithic systems. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of a miniaturized, virtually and physically reconfigurable system that will automatically maintain full situational awareness even when over 50% of the processing nodes fail (technology readiness level (TRL)-4). In Phase II, JARVIS will be further developed based upon the results of the Phase I study, to include demonstrating a prototype aircraft mission processing system that includes FACE and MOSA conformance (TRL-5) and is capable of being certified for flight. The focus of Phase III will be on the development of a production-representative JARVIS for an AH-1Z aircraft, using existing software (TRL-7)."

        "abstract": "QuickFlex proposes the FlexDuo mission processing architecture to improve upon the cost and fault tolerance capabilities of current rotorcraft mission computers, while creating enhanced processing capabilities to empower the computationally intensive mission applications of the future. FlexDuo consists of a collection of FPGA-accelerated Processing Nodes with the capability to detect lost Processing Nodes and automatically restore their associated functionality. To accommodate various types of mission functions, FlexDuo provides a flexible execution model: functions may run on the CPU or be implemented on the FPGA for hardware acceleration. FlexDuo Processing Nodes are networked using AFDX, a widely deployed, high data-rate avionic network.FlexDuo uses an ARINC 653 compliant RTOS to guarantee that functions will not interfere with each other when running on the CPU. In addition, FlexDuo uses an innovative technique to provide this kind of guarantee for functions placed on the FPGA. This gives FlexDuo FPGA-enhanced performance while preserving reliability and lowering certification hurdles. FlexDuo reduces cost by minimizing the use of aviation specific chips (which are costly due to lower production volumes), simplifying certification through function encapsulation, and providing a performance hedge against obsolescence."

As a result, pilots must actively and manually process the data to identify and process targets. This takes the pilots focus and attention away from more important and critical tasks. There is however potential for a system to passively and intelligently monitor and analyze IR data and notify the pilot when a threat is detected that requires the pilot to handle and respond to the situation. In this proposal, we describe a solution that incorporates a variety of image-enhancing algorithms and state- of-the-art computer vision techniques as well as advanced artificial intelligence reasoning frameworks to create a high performing system that also has low false-positive rates. For each detected object, the system will extract a variety of defining characteristics and features, such as size, shape, location, and heat signature as well as longer-term flight patterns. The system will also be designed to be easily integrated into existing onboard systems."

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, carry cameras, sensors, communications equipment, or other payloads. UAVs have become increasingly used for applications where the use of manned flight vehicles is not appropriate or is not feasible. UAVs gather image data while windows protect the sensors. Conformal windows are desirable as they maintain the shape of the aircraft and allow for a larger angle of regard; windows may have little to no symmetry. Spinel is an excellent candidate window material as it is both durable and multi-spectral (ultraviolet through mid-wave infrared). Spinel is more erosion resistant than other candidates. The availability of blanks currently limits the size and curvature for potential window applications. The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate new manufacturing processes to provide near net shape blanks to improve upon current state of the art processes which start with a thick, planar blank and grind them to the desired shape. CeraNovas proprietary processing produces a high strength polycrystalline transparent optical quality spinel, more than double the strength other available spinels and is not limited to planer shapes. The higher strength of CeraNova spinel also allows thinner optics to be designed and used which in turn increases signal transmission."

Surmet has produced ALON domes and windows in a wide variety of sizes and shapes including parts with gentle and complex curvatures, and will apply the same processes to its spinel material. Surmet utilizes a sinter\/HIP process to produce its spinel, which results in a material with a dramatically higher strength than hot pressing. Surmet has used this process to deliver over 1,000 spinel lenses to a major defense contractor for their targeting pods. However, inclusions typically found in our spinel material have limited its application.Surmet, in an effort to scale-up the spinel process, have already made process improvements that results in a dramatic reduction in the inclusions in our spinel. These improvements combined with our ALON processing knowledge, will allow Surmet to produce near net shaped, high strength, conformal spinel windows. In Phase II, the process will be scaled up to produce multiple uncracked, fully dense spinel window blanks per program requirements."

The FORM measurement system for window metrology uses a custom sensor package that looks through the window at modulated images on a digital display. Powerful tomographic software and careful calibration are used to determine the surface irregularity of both surfaces of the window. Having performed the key demonstration of the FORM technique, we now propose to develop an infrared version of this test, capable of measuring visibly opaque windows that do not transmit visible wavelength light. This system uses thermal radiation from a modulated infrared source detected by a thermal imaging sensor assembly.

These include the methods to fixture the components, advancements in grinding and polishing machines, processing techniques, and methods for measuring them to their demanding optical tolerances. Our goal in this Phase I effort would be to develop a metrology solution that is capable to accurately measure both the surface irregularity and transmitted wavefront of these visibly opaque, infrared-transparent aerodynamic domes, conformal windows, and optical corrector elements. OptiPro will evaluate software, algorithms, and hardware enhancements that would super charge its existing UltraSurf 5 axis non-contact measuring machine thus improving the performance and precision of the measurement system to meet these more difficult demands. The Phase I effort will focus primarily on two main areas: identify opportunities for improved performance and accuracy, as well as refinement \/ enhancement of usability and analytical tools. We believe that this path forward will lead to a metrology system in Phase II that could demonstrate a more cost effective production of aerodynamic domes. The Phase III commercialization plan would be to demonstrate and offer this unit for sale as a product by OptiPro."

        "abstract": "Aspheric and conformal optics have become critical components in the aerodynamic features of missiles and aircraft systems. The smooth and sleek shape of the optics improves the aerodynamic quality and performance. These shapes are difficult to manufacture and measure due to the significant amount of inherent optical aberrations. However, production of the component requires metrology feedback on the surface figure to ensure quality of the dome or window. This process is time-consuming, error prone, and potentially damaging to the part due the amount of manual handling required.Optimax proposes solving the metrology and manufacturing problem by combining fringe reflection measurement technique, and robotic deterministic polishing. Fringe reflection measurement technique (also known as deflectometry) is a robust non-contact, high resolution, non-interferometric method to measure surface figure. Its required hardware is significantly less expensive and more flexible than standard phase shifting interferometers. In addition, deflectometry can measure surfaces with larger slope deviation than interferometry and can more easily (and in a less expensive manner) measure large components."

These include the methods to fixture the components, advancements in grinding and polishing machines, processing techniques, and methods for measuring them to their demanding optical tolerances. Our goal in this Phase I effort would be to develop a manufacturing process to produce visibly transparent large conformal windows and corrector optical elements. We will build upon our past grinding and polishing knowledge while researching opportunities for improvements, including expansion of our current machine platforms so that we may in a Phase II effort, if awarded, demonstrate the capability to produce conformal shapes up to 24 inches in size. This development effort will focus on further enhancements of OptiPros ultrasonic grinding technology (OptiSonic), UltraForm Finishing (UFF), and UltraSmooth Finishing (USF). We will utilize OptiPros SXL500 and Triumph XL grinding and polishing platforms to perform this work. We plan to push the limits of the machines working envelope to evaluate the likelihood of their use to complete the phase II requirements. Our final goal would be to develop a complete, cost effective, robust manufacturing solution in Phase II."

This approach will produce a very unique grain structure that can offer high strength, high fracture toughness, and high oxidation resistance. Spark plasma sintering or hot isostatic pressing will be used as a means for densification during the Phase I study. During the Phase I program, UES will collaborate with MR&amp;D to conduct thermal-structure analysis in order to compute transient temperatures, deformations, stresses and strains for the materials within the selected propulsion system component during simulated operation.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

Scenarios are integrated in a game-based trainer that combines game modes to challenge trainees and develop advanced planning skills. RAMPART will also combine wargaming with skill-based metrics to objectively assess performance, and enable the missile defense community to train missile defense planners so they have the flexibility to address the unanticipated threats of modern and future adversaries.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

Practicing in a simulated environment has little value without the ability to accurately assess and remediate performance. Unique actions and decisions of each performer must be quantified and related to mission success or failure in a way that appropriately maps the contributing knowledge, skills, and abilities. Through scoring, the system can determine proficiency gaps and recommend necessary areas of improvement. Gamification principles can be applied to increase engagement and sustain motivation for the learner to hone his or her craft. To address these challenges, we propose to develop SCORESimulated Challenges for Operational Readiness and Engagement. SCORE will enable a data-driven competency-centric learning lifecycle by integrating with external simulations, analyzing user interaction data, generating performance metrics and presenting the users performance in a gameful design that leverages best practices from the psychology of motivation and engagement.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

        "abstract": "One of the challenges for a missile defense systems command and control (C2) operators relates to the process of collecting, parsing, and analyzing vast quantities of information. In order to maintain situational awareness of a battlespace environment, C2 operators require access to visualization systems that incorporate human-centered design principles to support operators unique cognitive abilities, and that can rapidly aggregate large sums of raw data, enabling rapid emergence of critical patterns hidden within. In support of this requirement, Adaptive Immersion Technologies plans to develop adaptive, human-centered visualization tools that can produce tailored visualizations for enhancing situational awareness. The tools will be developed for use within both virtual reality and augmented reality media with holographic image overlays, immersing the user in a realistic missile defense battlespace. In support of this objective, Phase I will focus on the front end domain analytic work (cognitive task analysis), computational modeling of operators data navigation and filtering policies, initial development of the prototype adaptive user interface system, templates for the visualizations, gesture recognition controls, and integration within a virtual reality-based missile defense operator system. While the products of the overall effort will directly benefit C2 operators in ballistic missile defense systems, adaptive user interfaces can support any operational environment where there is a requirement to analyze and process large quantities of informational data under significant time constraints. These products will be commercialized and transitioned to customers in the domains of space operations, emergency\/disaster response, air traffic control, cybersecurity, and general C2.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

        "abstract": "Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Thermally Efficient Infrared Emitter (THEIRE). The proposed THEIRE technology is based on spatially tiled high-resolution spatial light modulators (SLMs) and optically induced near-blackbody radiation from vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) arrays. Using the novel implementation of high dynamic range SLMs for pixelwise control of laser power, THEIRE enables large formats (4k4k) presentation of dynamic wide temperature (also capable of high temperature scene of 2000K) at higher frame rates (greater than or equal to 400 Hz) for high fidelity infrared projection in ground test environments. Due to the thermal integration at the VACNT and the fast speed of SLM, THEIRE offers flickerless emission. The system design also makes it thermally efficient and compatible with cryo-vacuum operation (at ~100K). In Phase I, POC plans to establish the technical feasibility of THEIRE by investigating potential emitter solutions, performing modeling and simulation to conduct trade studies, optimize system and predict performance, and testing materials at the coupon level to anchor model predictions. In Phase II, a working THEIRE prototype will be developed and demonstrated for evaluation.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

These designs will be produced using WTIs proprietary approach to antenna optimization operating on our 32 processor computer. Our software will be extended to optimize conformal antennas and arrays in deployment on missile defense assets. Fractal antennas are advantageous for this problem because they can be designed to be relatively compact and so there is design freedom in placing the antennas in such a fashion as to reduce the size of grating sidelobes. Grating sidelobes are expected at the highest frequencies of operation of wideband arrays, even if the lowest frequencies have elements sufficiently closely spaced to avoid them. The problem is especially severe at large scan angles. Fractal elements are also advantageous because their compactness tends to reduce inter-element coupling of array elements. Fractal elements are routinely designed to be wideband or multiband and thus facilitate frequency agility. These advantages combine synergistically to benefit a system operating under severe constraints of size, weight, area, and power.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

The unique features of these materials will allow for thermal protection, combined with structural contribution, and electrical protection properties integral to the material system. CRGs MG material platform is a lightweight composite system that combines a non-flammable thermal barrier resin with fiber reinforcements and other additives for structural performance, and conducting pathways integral to the material system for electrostatic discharge (ESD), electromagnetic interference (EMI), and lightning strike protection. The unique chemistry and processing traits of MG also make it lower cost than alternative materials and systems. The MG platform presents a new paradigm in thermal protection design that includes multi-functionality, ease in processing, and low cost.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

To address this need, a new SWIR-sensitive linear-mode avalanche photodiode detector array, will be optimized for low-light imaging, fabricated, and demonstrated. Unlike existing SWIRavalanche photodiodes (APDs), the new ultra-low-dark-current APD will employ a design that suppresses thermal dark current by a factor of 2000. When hybridized to a low-noise capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) readout integrated circuit (ROIC), low signal levels are detectable. In Phase I, wafers containing PIN diodes integrating the low dark current InGaAs absorber will be manufactured, and tested. Select diodes will be packaged and characterized. In the Phase I option, the best absorption layer designs will be integrated with two alternative ultra-low excess noise multiplication layer APDs.Single-element APDs and arrays will be fabricated from the wafers and characterized for dark current, gain, capacitance, and excess noise factor as a function of reverse bias. Their performance when coupled to low-noise ROICS will be determined.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

        "abstract": "Imaging in low light conditions is very difficult as it requires a high sensitivity and low leakage current detector, very low detector and readout noise, a small pixel, and large format, attributes that are difficult to obtain simultaneously. To address the demanding requirements, The Nu-Trek Team is offering a short wave infrared (SWIR) low light sensor based on HgCdTe Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs). The HgCdTe APDs have very low leakage current and a very low excess noise factor that does not increase with gain, are highly linear, and can meet solicitation requirements. Nu-Trek is a supplier of enabling digital readout integrated circuits (DROICs) and will leverage a DROIC under development, reducing the risk and investment required to realize the Low Light Sensor.For the Low Light DROIC, the design under development will be modified to offer low effective noise, high dynamic range, and very low power, which reduces cooling requirements. The Low Light DROIC will have current limiting and will be designed to operate without catastrophic failures in high radiation environments.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

In this Phase I program our goal is to develop a solid-state power amplifier using GaN MMICs that cover K-band communications frequencies.The SSPA must be reliable, supportable and sustainable, with easily replaced line replaceable units (LRUs).Nuvotronics plans to leverage earlier SBIR work on a miniaturized TWT replacement SSPA at K-band which forms the basis for our LRU.Power will be increased using a new high-power combiner structure demonstrating novel features and advanced manufacturing techniques.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

The galvanic corrosion between silver and copper which causes red plague is not reliably detectable with conventional cable test equipment and methods and detection instead relies upon destructive techniques, such as stripping off the insulation. Nondestructive red plague detection technology is needed to reduce the risk of wire failure, increase readiness, and decrease maintenance costs. Luna is proposing two complimentary technologies for nondestructively detecting red plague based upon electromagnetic effects. Together, these two techniques can detect red plague in wire conductors and shielding both before and after incorporation into electronic equipment. For example, the magnetic fields that cause the skin effect are distorted by red plague in a wires conductor. Finite element method magnetcs (FEMM) will be leveraged to model how the severity and location of red plague affect impedance\/resistance at a given frequency. The red plague will be produced with reliable control over severity and location in Ethylene-Tetrafluoroethylene (XL-ETFE) isulated silver-plated copper wire. The capability and sensitiveity of the two nondestructive detection techniques will be compaired and validated against a destructive technique for quantify the production of copper oxides through red plague corrosion.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a non-destructive test method to identify and quantify the formation of red plague corrosion within an insulated silver-plated copper wire. Cross-linked ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene (XL-ETFE)-insulated silver-plated copper wire demonstrates high performance and is commonly used in military and aerospace applications as hook-up and lead wire, but is prone to galvanic corrosion that can lead to unpredictable in-flight failures after only 10 years of life.There is currently no acceptable method to determine the extent of corrosion in a silver-plated copper wire.Our proposed approach for red plague corrosion detection is to transmit a well-defined signal through the wire and accurately measure the output signal. By employing sophisticated analysis techniques, we will identify the signature of red plague corrosion and quantitatively calibrate it with the extent of corrosion present in the wire. Our approach to the measurement and analysis provides the sensitivity needed to detect early stages of corrosion while reducing the potential for erroneous detection. With the proposed development of a highly-sensitive and accurate test method to quantitatively detect red plague corrosion within an insulated silver-plated copper wire, we will establish the foundation of a novel commercial test system.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

The sensor head ensures optimal alignment of transmit and receive antennas for non-contacting near-field measurements. The transceiver can sweep the transmit power and tone spacing, and can perform phase measurements of the intermodulation distortion (IMD) products. The flexibility of the transceiver enables both two-tone probing to characterize passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion and one-tone probing to characterize harmonic distortion. By measuring both the amplitude and the phase, the MMGCS can fully characterize the source of the nonlinearity. A model-based classifier is used to estimate corrosion severity and ignore clutter. The MMGCS requires no surface preparation and can inspect large surface areas quickly. Automating the measurement process allows individuals with minimal training to objectively assess corrosion damage.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

        "abstract": "It is well documented that corrosion, and many other non-perfections of metal structures, when exposed to multi-tone radio-frequency (RF) emissions exhibit Passive Inter Modulation (PIM) emissions. PIM establishes fundamental limits of performance for wireless sensor, communication, radar, and navigation systems that operate in high output power environments. Compounding the PIM problem is the large number of co-located RF and Microwave systems in typical military and commercial environments. When a signal with a least two frequencies or modulation is applied to a structure, additional frequency components will form at integer multiples of the separation frequency(s) between the signal components. Generally PIM processes have a signature based on the physical process that generates them. PIM is a very small effect, and its use in standoff detection and characterization of corrosion poses significant challenges with regard to receiver dynamic range, receiver sensitivity, linearity, accessible spectrum (unlicensed band use only preferred), and transmit power.(Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8482 (17 November 15))"

The power lines are subtle objects for the pilot in the cockpit to see, not to mention when visibility gets bad such as in the cases of operating at night and under poor weather conditions. Thus, power-line-strike accident has been a major threat for helicopter safety. The Goleta Star team will use advanced processing techniques to develop wire detection algorithms. The team brings together complimentary skills from over twenty years investigating W-band radar for wire and obstacle detection for safe flight and landing for helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. We will investigate approaches to recognizing wires, including wires from 3\/8 up to bundled high power transmission lines, from angles of incidence of 0-degrees (head-on from the sensor) to 45-degrees angle of incidence from the sensor. The techniques will be developed utilizing the previously collected fully calibrated government furnished sensor data at W-band. We will then develop Phase 2 and Phase 3 plans to fully mature the algorithm(s) and transition to candidate Army assets, and possible commercial utility."

State-of-the-art CFD modeling, while having advanced significantly in the last three decades, still cannot adequately model boundary layer transition points.BENEFIT:The boundary layer transition measurements will facilicate improvements to computational modeling of the hypersonic flight regime. These improvements will increase the efficiency, reliability and performance of hypersonic flight vehicles.

A gun-hardened piezo-based sensor, with no moving parts, will sense setback and balloting accelerations to accurately pinpoint the projectiles transition into free-space at the barrel exit. Using analysis of the acquired data and the known and consistent barrel length, it will be possible to infer with microsecond precision barrel travel-time. From this data, a straightforward calculation of actual muzzle velocity can be provided to the fuze. This measurement can be used to modify (in flight) the fuze timing provided by the fire control computer to greatly increase the accuracy of the airburst. Fundamental to this approach is the need to implement a cost effective solution, as a full guidance systems have been shown to dramatically increase costs to the point of infeasibility. Moreover, since actual firing conditions in the gun breech will change between the first and any subsequent rounds fired, the performance of this timing method will effectively compensate for temperature variation compensates airburst fuze timing."

Pulse voltammetry techniques provide high detection sensitivity, discrimination against charging currents, and information sufficient for mechanism identification and extraction of quantitative kinetic parameters. Model-based analysis tools are needed to make the power of these characterization techniques available to the electrochemical research community. In Phase I, we will utilize established solution methods to provide computational models that predict the response of multistep electrochemical mechanisms during square wave voltammetry. The models will be linked with estimation and optimization techniques to provide the desired kinetic parameters resulting in the best agreement with an entire experimental voltammogram, and their uncertainty. Issues addressed will include data transfer from computer controlled electrochemical instruments, coupled electrochemical and chemical reactions, and square wave scan direction. In Phase II, we will further develop the analysis package to address a broader range of mechanisms and pulse voltammetry techniques. The end result will be a validated software product for pulse voltammetry analysis. The tool will be integrated into commercial electrochemical instrument control software and can also operate independently."

        "abstract": "Pulsed voltammetry is a characterization tool for electrochemical systems that has been around for many decades. Unlike the more commonly used cyclic voltammetry techniques, the additional degrees of freedom intrinsic to pulsed voltammetry techniques permit the decoupling of reaction kinetics from diffusion, and allow for the precise measurement of a range of reaction parameters, including the half-wave potential, rate constant, charge transfer coefficient, and reactant diffusion coefficients. However, these additional degrees of freedom add complexity to the experiments, and have proved to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of these techniques. This proposal seeks to develop a toolkit to permit a user to rapidly and easily employ pulsed voltammetry techniques to extract as much information as possible from a system with minimal user input. Ultimately, the tool being developed here will iteratively tune a series of voltammograms to obtain an optimally precise measurement of the system under test. In Phase I, fitting routines and statistical analysis of a single series of square wave voltammograms will be investigated, and then iterative design of experiment algorithms will be developed in Phase II for application to real world systems in Phase III."

        "abstract": "Rotorcraft landing and takeoff is dangerous in environments where obstacles, particularly wires or power lines, exist, and pilot vision is degraded by obscurants such as dust, smoke, fog, rain and snow. This SBIR would focus on a radar solution to detecting wires and power cables when landing in a visually degraded environment. Existing data for wires and power lines with millimeter wave radars produce either curtains or periodic bright spots through the Bragg effect when used in traditional real beam imaging. However, if the sensor is capable of penetrating an obscurant and has an automated technique to recognize a power line or wire, the sensor can simply send data to an independent imager to nominally represent a wire without the need to image it. The development of a technique or algorithm to recognize wires at a variety of approach angles will improve the Army&apos;s capability of operation in degraded visual environments."

        "abstract": "Birds of prey, also known as raptors, are birds that hunt or feed on other animals. They are characterized by keen vision that allows them to detect prey during flight. Since vision is the most important sense for birds, and good eyesight is essential for safe flight, this group has a number of adaptations which give visual acuity superior to that of other vertebrate groups.The objective of this SBIR is to develop an innovative solution which will allow the operator to achieve the same sort of superior imaging and improved situational awareness available to avian predators. The effective focal length (EFL) of the imaging system itself should be able to change; simple digital magnification of an image does not provide the kind of image clarity discussed here. While variable focal length lenses have been demonstrated (see references), shortcomings have been identified both in the range of the EFL shift and in the resolution capabilities of the system. The intent of this effort is to push the boundaries of this technology and achieve extreme shift and resolution. This EFL shift should be maximized, with a minimum EFL of no more than 40mm, and a dynamic shift of 10x (threshold), 100x (objective). Time for EFL shift will be considered; while there is no rigid time requirement, the lens must be able to shift across it&apos;&apos;s full dynamic range quickly ("

        "abstract": "There currently is a shortcoming for heavy fuel engines that have a rated power below 100 BHP that are compatible with both JP-8 and DF-2, have high power to weight and power to volume density, provide good fuel consumption characteristics, and operate over extreme climatic ranges ranging from below -25 F to 125 F ambient. One developing technology that could potentially fit this niche market are spark ignited heavy fuel, rotary diesel engines that can provide from 10 BHP to 50 BHP per rotor, have best brake fuel consumption less than 0.5 lbm\/bhp-hr, and have an engine power density of 1 hp\/lbm for small ground vehicles. A major challenge with such engines is the combustion system development, of which the ignition system is a critical element. This is due to the ignition source&apos;s direct contact with injected fuel and the complex fuel and air flow path characteristics. There are significant performance and reliability gains with a high energy ignition event at low engine speeds and startup, compared to low ignition energy at high speed conditions. The performance requirements for this ignition system SBIR are as follows:Variable output: 50 - 200 mJ \/ sparkResponse Time: 2000 HzAmbient Temperature Range: -25 F to 125 FSize: 1.5 LitersWeight: 4.5 lbsPower Consumption: 120WOutput (plug) channels: 5Fully controllable: Energy output, timing"

Existing CFD codes are parallelized using MPI, a highly effective approach for distributed architectures with large quantities of system memory and relatively simple serial processors. However, new HPC systems based on MIC co-processors have fundamentally different memory properties and execution paths. To fully leverage the speed up offered by these new architectures, we propose to develop two tools: A hardware adapter for restructuring existing codes as hybrid codes for specific hardware, and an optimization tool to determine optimal parameter settings as well as processor and memory allocations for specific problem instances. These tools will enable CFD code performance improvements without significant rewriting of the code itself."

        "abstract": "Current approaches for resolving rotorcraft fuselage responses in the presence of aerodynamic\/structural excitation require ample conservatism because current CFD-based aeromechanic solutions lack the capability to include detailed elastic fuselage models. Instead, a siloed approach is employed where results of one analysis are replayed into another. A particular limitation of the siloed method is its inability to capture rotor wake impingement, which has resulted in empennage buffet problems not being encountered until flight testing of a new design. To provide a fully integrated aeroelastic simulation capability for complete vertical lift configurations that will overcome these limitations, ATA Engineering, Inc. (ATA) proposes the development of a novel simulation coupling methodology. The proposed project will develop a three-code coupling (comprehensive rotor, fluid, and structural dynamics) framework and leverage existing and emerging computational technologies for integrating disparate solution strategies of each domain. The methodology, which will accommodate both loose and tight rotor coupling schemes, will ultimately be integrated in the DoD CREATE HELIOS framework. In Phase I, ATA will develop data communication utilities to couple simulation codes widely used in industry. The utilities will be extended to a robust software product in Phase II and used to simulate a real world rotorcraft aeroelastity problem."

        "abstract": "Helicopter buffeting is an aeroelastic problem, with mutually interacting airloads and structural motions from the rotor, hub, fuselage, and empennage. Buffeting is amenable to the state-of-the-art analysis technology and addressing it is long overdue. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) provides the highest fidelity for the fluid physics while Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) provides accurate elastic structure modeling. Combined, CFD\/CSD coupled analysis is essential to representing the mutually dependent aeroelastic interactions associated with buffeting. However, current coupling implementations are limited to rotors and wings, while the fuselage and empennage structures critical to the prediction of buffeting are rigidly modeled. An opportunity exists to address this problem by expanding CFD\/CSD coupled analysis technology to include the aeroelastic coupling of fuselage and empennage. This effort leverages existing technology for CSD by utilizing the Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis System (RCAS) and CFD by utilizing OVERFLOW and Create-AV Helios to focus development on the fluid structure interface (FSI). The main requirements of which are the accurate transfer of deformations to CFD and energy conservation during the application of aerodynamic forces to CSD. Although this development targets interfacing CFD with RCAS, the developed FSI will be general and made available for integration into other structural dynamics programs."

Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) methodologies are effective tools to reconfigure the materials development process and accelerate implementation of new higher performance alloys into demanding applications. QuesTek Innovations, an ICME leader, proposes to develop new LENS Additive Manufacturing techniques and new finite element approaches to characterizing the effect of AM defects on material properties. C64 is a gear steel designed to be an upgrade over X53 via traditional-processing, and serves as a good transition candidate. In Phase I, QuesTek will utilize currently developed ICME tools and models to develop a new gradient deposition technique to produce varying material properties (e.g., in-build carburizing). New finite element techniques will focus on porosity distributions in AM material to statistically determine material properties. QuesTek has support from OEM Bell Helicopter, and will utilize the expertise of Penn State University (AM excellence center) throughout the program. Demonstration of feasibility allows for further optimization, characterization, and wear testing to be accomplished in Phase II work."

The latency of these resin systems and corresponding long cure cycles are adequate for wet filament winding large structures and low rate production. However, transitioning these matrix materials to the production of tactical rocket motor cases has resulted in inefficient manufacturing. Moreover, these resins were developed with a primary focus on fiber-translation as opposed to a balance of properties and damage tolerance required for tactical rocket motor cases. Accordingly, the objective of this work is to develop innovative matrix systems for carbon fiber reinforced composite tactical rocket motor applications that are optimized for processing and performance. The developed wet-winding resin systems will be compatible with other composite manufacturing methods such as infusion processes and pultrusion. Thus, a universal resin matrix will be created that enables combinations of manufacturing methods to be utilized which provide the greatest benefit from a performance and cost standpoint."

        "abstract": "Fiber reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites (TPMCs) provide unique advantages over thermoset composites for missile structures. However, autoclave and compression molding techniques can only produce fairly simple geometric structures. Limitations inherent to traditional tooling techniques mean that the best that can be achieved for TPMC parts is to make the component in sections and then join these sections through a complex process. To obtain the economy and performance of TPMC for missile structures, the Army needs innovative manufacturing techniques that will allow producing TPMC components in complex shapes. Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG), joining with CRGs Smart Tooling subsidiary, Spintech LLC, proposes to implement Smart Tooling technology for TPMC injection molding, to obtain economical continuous-fiber TPMC components with complex shapes for missile. The benefit of the Smart Tooling approach is that it overcomes the limitations of trapped tooling and offers a low-force extraction, fast-cycle-time methodology for complex and trapped geometry components. This approach will give the Army continuous fiber missile components with improved damage tolerance, faster processing and assembly, and reduced joint weight at lower cost and faster rate than alternative production methods. This technology will have application for other military and commercial components as well."

        "abstract": "Vadum will develop a Ground Penetrating MIMO Vibrometer (GPMV) which utilizes a radio-acoustic Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) aperture to detect surface and buried explosive hazards. The sensor leverages common hardware to achieve three distinct modes of operation using low and high frequency bands for both the Acoustic Frequency (AF) in the acoustic transmitter and the Radio Frequency (RF) in the RF transceiver. The modes of operation are: 1) a low-RF low-AF mode to detect the vibrational response of buried targets, 2) a high-RF low-AF mode to detect the disturbed earth above buried targets, and 3) a high-AF mode to image surface targets in clutter environments unsuitable for traditional forward-looking radars. The MIMO aperture enables beam focusing, spatial filtering, and image formation without the requirement for vehicle motion as in Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR). The dynamic range of the GPMV is maximized using an active feed-forward analog canceller, which provides the added benefit of measuring the amplitude and phase response in the GPMVs field of view. This additional sensing modality can affectively be used to sense dielectric discontinuities which indicate the presence of a buried hazard. The Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) acoustic stimulus and beamforming techniques provide information about target range, size, and shape. Analysis of the baseband waveforms can be used to classify targets based on shape."

Currently, standoff detection capabilities are limited to forward looking systems, which provide limited penetration of the ground surface due to the low grazing angle required for forward looking standoff detection. Additionally, forward looking arrays are somewhat limited in spatial diversity due to the constraints imposed by placing antenna elements on a single platform. Our approach incorporates a design that spreads the antenna array across multiple platforms to provide a new multi-static ground penetrating radar capability that increases angular diversity and optimizes incidence angle for subsurface detection and 3D characterization of buried targets."

        "abstract": "The current MDA Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) Planner, while mature and reliable, has limitations.Those limitations include the absence of a modular structure to allow changes and additions to planner algorithms inexpensively, inability to share data easily with other applications, operation on a stand-alone laptop, a complex user interface, and inability to support embedded training.This work seeks to overcome those limitations by starting with a clean sheet of paper design that re-thinks how planner software across the Department of Defense is created.Harmonia proposes a very powerful solution called GSOAP that can help Government or contractors build planner systems for a wide variety of domains and customers.GSOAP will dynamically meld together existing proven software components (e.g., to predict the trajectory of a missile, or to display political or terrain maps) along with training control algorithms (e.g., for so-called white cell control by an instructor) to instantiate a complete Planner. GSOAP will facilitate reuse of mature algorithms from the current C2BMC Planner for MDA, or it can potentially use algorithms developed for other services. Harmonias work builds on its prior Phase II SBIR work on planners for MDA."

Besides providing a secure logging facility, the IP block will also provide security services for the end application, relieving the application designer from the costly and time consuming task of implementing these functions in a secure manner. As an IP block that can be included in an FPGA or ASIC design, or realized as a standalone device, the costs and schedule risks of implementing the logging facility will be dramatically reduced."

        "abstract": "The MDA is seeking an innovative solution to detect\/identify network infrastructure components used for operational testing, configure the network per specifications, and test\/monitor the network. To meet the goals of this SBIR project, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a network Monitoring and Configuration Automation (MOCA) technology. MOCA takes network architecture as input and provides innovative algorithms for automatic generation of network configuration files, distribution of configuration information across large networks, and Web-based network reconfiguration\/monitoring capability. MOCA will be developed as a software-only solution and implement the network setup by generating configuration information at a centralized location, segmenting the configuration information for subnetworks, and sending it appropriately. Key contributions of MOCA are its transparency with respect to network operations, compliance with existing network standards, low complexity, and low-cost operation. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of MOCA by creating a representative network in a laboratory environment, implementing key software components, developing a validation and verification plan, and demonstrating MOCAs net configuration capability. In Phase II, POC will develop a full-scale prototype reaching TRL-6. This prototype will demonstrate, using the plan developed in Phase I, that MOCA can be deployed in large enterprise-wide networks and can effectively implement network configuration\/reconfiguration."

        "abstract": "&quot;Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) tools play a key role to assess BMDS operational performance. However, current simulation missions require extensive participation of human testers\/operators to configure the network components and maintain the network topology to meet the network architecture and security constraint. This drives up cost and hinders the evaluation and testing process, and also prevents fully automated and repeated simulation and tests. In addition, scattered information is produced during the simulation and tests, which often prevents the user from obtaining a holistic view of the test in terms of its compliance with network and security requirements. This impairs the users ability to accurately and quickly gain the needed understanding of the system under test and evaluation.To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation, Inc (IAI) proposes to develop a User-Configurable Autonomous Establishing and Management of Secure Networks (AiMNET) solution that automates the network establishment and maintenance from a single centralized network control node through network discovery, monitoring, analysis and configuration. The end result of this effort, if successfully developed, will significantly improve the reliable network access to support automated and repeated simulation and tests, and reduce the cost and risks for networking.&quot;"

        "abstract": "To address Missile Defense Agencys (MDA) need for new approaches to perform inline threat generation (ITG) in a constructive digital simulation, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop an innovative Large-scale Inline Validation-Embedded Threat Adaptation and Generation (LIVETAG) system, based on physics-based adaptation of threat models for inline threat data generation, heuristic automation of offline threat data validation process to ensure credibility of generated threat data, and predictive scheduler for tightly interweaving threat data generation processes to maximize the use of computing resources in real-time execution. The innovations in unified threat data generation and validation scheme and predictive scheduler enable LIVETAG to provide real-time generated, detailed, high fidelity, high resolution threat data packages to constructive digital simulations during the initialization and execution of a simulation event, and maintain the credibility of threat data. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of LIVETAG by developing its simulation conceptual model, top-level architecture, concept of operations (CONOPS) and verification and validation approaches for ITG, and a Phase I prototype system for evaluation. In Phase II, POC plans to mature Phase I prototype into a working prototype for performance assessment of missile defense simulations."

We propose to develop technology that uses Cases for Automating Realistic Threat Simulation (CARTS).CARTS will automate some of the work that experts currently do as part of threat data generation.We will apply and combine three methodologies in building CARTS: (1) knowledge acquisition, including structured interviews working through sample problems and their variants; (2) case based reasoning (CBR), to partition each expert decision space into a set of recognizable recurring challenges; and (3) behavior transition networks (BTNs), to cope with variation within each such case.During Phase I we will clarify requirements, constraints, and use cases; explore a range of expert inputs to high-fidelity data generation in order to identify the most promising areas for initial automation; develop algorithms and encode knowledge to automate selected decisions; demonstrate feasibility with a limited proof-of-concept prototype; and define a plan for Phase II.&quot;"

The proposed InTAP fiber coupler can operate with different fiber types and provides accurate measurements of the output power, differential phase, polarization and residual pump power. The InTAP module is designed to operate at kW- power level. In Phase I, the company will develop a detailed concept and perform analysis and parameter optimization of the InTAP module, address the most critical technological challenges,build and evaluate the system prototype and demonstrate possibility to sensing with InTAP moduleoptical power and polarization state of kW-class laser beam. In Phase II, Optonicus will develop the fully functioning InTAP fiber tap coupler system that will be delivered to the MDA for further evaluation. Optonicus will also work with MDA prime contractors in Phase II to commercialize the technology for DoD and provide its transition to the markets in Phase III."

        "abstract": "Modeling and simulation has long played a crucial role in the design and development of High Energy laser systems.Historically, two distinct types of optical performance models for HEL system models have been very important: wave optics models, and scaling law models.Wave optics models are both more accurate and more robust, yielding reliable performance predictions even for systems incorporating new design innovations, and even when operating in stressing regimes.Scaling law models are less accurate but faster running models designed to approximate the results that would be obtained with a wave optics model.Using scaling law model it is possible to perform large trade studies and long duration simulation runs much more quickly and\/or using less computer resources. We believe it may be possible to develop a new and better kind of fast-running model for HEL systems, one that offers all the same advantages of scaling law models, but with none of their disadvantages.Each such fast-running model, called a surrogate model, would be automatically generated directly from simulation results produced by a high fidelity wave optics model for the same HEL system using robust mathematical methods, implemented by software tool suites such as Dakota or Optizelle"

The wave-optics-based software platform will enable high-accuracy predictive performance analysis of different configurations of unobscured, centrally obscured, spatially distributed with multiple subapertures, and\/or conformal phased array systems. The proposed simulation platform will take into account critical\/key system engineering design constraints (e.g., diffraction, jitter, aero-optic disturbances, atmospheric propagation, thermal blooming, adaptive optics control, coherent\/incoherent beam combining, etc.). Additionally, an approach for integration of the proposed software with capabilities for computation of physically realizable vertical profiles of meteorological data will be developed. This feature will enable more precise performance evaluation of HEL beam directors for various geographical locations worldwide. The proposed development builds upon the extensive research and development background of the Optonicus team. It includes unique computational techniques for analysis of wave propagation in both turbulent and refractive atmosphere. It also leverages the companys recent successful transitioning of the developed computational tools to GPU-based platforms (NVIDIAs CUDA) and experience in development of atmospheric sensing, adaptive optics, and fiber array technologies."

This programmability allows a single DROIC to be used for multiple applications, with each application having different resolution and speed requirements. In addition to the digital programmability, Alphacores novel DROIC has a counter that uses a small fraction of the area than a digital logic based counter and thus allows fabricating the DROICs in a reasonably priced 130nm and 180nm fabrication processes.In addition to the lower costs, this architecture allows keeping the pixel area small. A 14um x 14um pixel is demonstrated in this proposal, but even a pixel smaller than10um x 10um is possible. Due to the fact that Alphacore has an area-optimized, low-power, 10b, 40MSPS ADC IP core available, we can place several of them on the DROIC chip and, as a result, the frame rate can clearly exceed 200 frames\/sec for a 512x512 array. The frame rate can be as high as few kframes\/sec.The ROIC will be radiation hardened to 300krad(Si).&quot;"

        "abstract": "This proposal outlines a large-format small-pitch low-power digital pixel readout integrated circuit (DPROIC) for dual-band infrared focal plane arrays to achieve high sensitivity, high resolution, large dynamic range, low noise, large field of view and fast data rate. This digital pixel readout will be a complete camera-on-chip architecture when combined with single or dual polarity dual band detectors in a hybrid fashion. It will have a wide operating temperature range from cryogenic to room temperature to support a broad range of detector architectures. This readout circuit will also be radiation tolerant to survive harsh man-made and natural radiation environments, including high energy particles and photons to prevent catastrophic system failure. The proposed DPROIC will be implemented in a mature CMOS process with much more reasonable mask costs as compared to that of state-of-the-art line width processes, saving the government money and broadening the possible supplier base. The final product will be flexible enough to be used as a generic readout integrated circuit for a broad range of missile defense applications."

Performance gains in these systems will provide broad impact for a variety of programs. Thermal batteries are primarily composed of active electrochemical materials, pyrotechnic charge, insulation, and a case. Active electrochemical materials and pyrotechnic charge in thermal reserve batteries have been optimized; hence, performance gains must come from improvements in the case, insulation, and manufacturing methods.Innovations are needed to translate performance and reliability of thermal reserve batteries to missile systems with long duration missions.Cornerstone Research Group Inc.

Such unique properties among electrochemical power systems are provided with application of molten salt electrolyte, which is in solid form under normal storage conditions. Upon activation, thermal batteries are heated with an internal pyrotechnic charge above melting temperature of the molten salt electrolyte. This allows for fast ion mobility and charge transfer reaction. Due to their unique properties, thermal batteries are primarily used in DoD applications, specifically in munitions and weapon systems. Modern applications and their latest development call for higher capacity and higher power performance thermal batteries with smaller mass and volume. We are proposing development of novel anode and cathode materials that will significantly improve the performance of current thermal batteries. Identified needs and applications define the significance of the existing market, and indicate on projected markets growth. Along with our development in Phase I and Phase II, we will aim for fully functional prototypes and field tries, and marketing of our technology to DoD agencies."

        "abstract": "In 2006 Tanenhaus and Associates, Inc. began designing a miniature IMU that met SWaP requirements using its patented innovative approach of combining arrays of COTS MEMS sensors to achieve far superior performance than MEMS used alone. The MEMS arrays provide redundancy and robustness and achieve sensor low drift errors. This Phase I SBIR will provide environmental testing and performance data on COTS MEMS technology that is used in missile defense systems. TAIs ability to verify MEMS ruggedness and accuracy during the compensation of temperature, shock, and vibration while under motion is its primary advantage. TAIs M350 is a high performance GPS-denied tactical grade IMU\/INS that meets all SWaP requirements for small size, light weight, low power.The MEMS sensors are fabricated in a radiation hardened process. The static performance parameters of measured inertial MEMS arrays that achieve low drift errors are at least two to three times better than the current state of the art gyros and accelerometer devices that make up the MEMS IMU.The TAI IMU\/INS design is flexible; software upgrades allow for its adaptability for a variety of uses with the same internal hardware. The outside case can be changed easily for different mission requirements."

        "abstract": "Lithium oxyhalide reserve batteries are critical for certain MDA missile systems due to their exceptional volumetric and gravimetric energy densities, wide operating temperature range, and long storage life.The current battery technology utilizes a 2-layer separator to meet the challenging requirements of materials compatibility, rapid electrolyte fill during activation, and anode-cathode catalyst short prevention.This composite separator makes battery assembly a difficult manual task, and there are concerns about continued sourcing of the individual materials.CFDRC proposes to develop a single layer separator that meets the performance and safety requirements with the added benefit of ease of handling for more automated battery assembly, increasing manufacturing yield and reducing cost.We have assembled a team with expertise in materials characterization and customization, battery performance analysis, oxyhalide battery prototyping and test, and oxyhalide battery manufacturing to provide this solution.Phase I will focus on testing candidate materials to identify the chemical composition and material microstructure that will best meet the requirements.Phase II will continue separator development with design and materials improvements as required, based on cell and battery-level testing, culminating in a separator material and design suitable for future MDA systems (EKV) and legacy systems (THAAD) utilizing oxyhalide reserve batteries."

The separator material will be a non-corroding and protective against toxicity of electrolyte. This advanced separator will also demonstrate excellent thermal stability over a range of temperature (-32 oC to 250 oC), and strength to withstand battery manufacturing operation. The gain in volumetric efficiency results from high surface area nanofiber material and the large number of small pores within the structure which not only stores electrolyte but aids in improved electrolyte distribution with speed.Advanced separators lower weight and thinner construct will result in lower flow and electrical resistance, thereby allowing electrolyte to penetrate and provide increased ionic conductivity and higher rate capability."

A new separator technology is needed to improve performance, provide more energy-efficient battery geometries, decrease manufacturing complexity, and lower cost by increasing operational lifetime. LOHB reserve cells must utilize materials that: (a) provide electrical isolation between electrodes, (b) maximize volumetric efficiency for electrolyte capacity, (c) optimize efficient electrolyte flow and distribution when the battery is activated, and (d) are suitable for a production environment. The targeted materials chemistry will be capable of integration into other battery systems for military, aerospace and commercial applications. In Phase I, InnoSense (ISL) will demonstrate proof-of-principle of flexible ceramic separators capable of operating in extreme corrosive environments. We will demonstrate MDA-relevant separator performance. We will work closely with industrial partners to ensure smooth integration with LOHBs. In Phase II, ISL will develop and rigorously-test separator prototype establishing scale-up pathways. ISL will have separators tested in oxyhalide batteries for battery performance by our industrial partner. Phase III efforts, in collaboration with our partners, will include further engineering of the separator integrated with LOHB, field level tests and evaluation leading to hardware qualification."

This is due to the extremely high melting temperatures of these materials (&gt; 4000 F), high hardness and a resistance to heat and wear. However, these same properties that make refractory metals so prized for rocket components make the manufacturing of these materials very difficult. The extremely high melting temperature requires the use of powder metallurgy for manufacturing and the high hardness makes machining components from these materials very difficult. Therefore, the manufacturing of refractory metals often involves complex, labor-intensive processing and results in the loss of a significant amount of raw materials after machining. If the manufacturing process could be adapted to additive manufacturing processes, the amount of raw materials and labor hours could be significantly reduced leading to higher manufacturing output and lower costs. Mainstream proposes to develop apply superconducting electron beam technology to produce refractory metal alloys through additive manufacturing."

The wood is difficult to procure to the Navy&apos;s specification and a longer-life nose fairing is required. Fiber-reinforced structural foam materials are proposed to be investigated and developed to establish a replacement material that will meet all the requirements for the existing nose fairing: including tension strength, shear strength, bending strength, density and equivalent or lower dielectric constant. Specimens that are easy to fabricate and also easy to test in a representative form factor will be used for initial screening tests to determine which materials have the highest probability of meeting the requirements. After selecting the most promising material candidate(s), the process that yield the best material properties will be developed. Once the material and processing have been established, all the required material properties will be characterized."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for replacement missile nose fairings, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new radio frequency RF Transparent Ceramic Composite for Missile Nose Fairings (CERFAIR) material and fabrication process. This composite will allow, for the first time, low-cost, scalable manufacturing of complex shapes for use as missile nose cone fairings. The proposed material is based on a ceramic coated polymer composite that is RF transparent and has a long, 50 yr lifetime. A unique fabrication method allows the material to be used for the production of complex geometries, an innovation that can be applied to private industry. The CERFAIR process results in a material with high fracture toughness, low brittleness, high resistance to thermal shock, and formability, directly addressing the Navy requirements for replacement nose fairing materials. The production method uses simplified and low cost reusable tooling and will provide not only new technology for the Navy but also profitable technology for the private sector. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of CERFAIR by fabricating and testing a subscale fairing shaped part. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a prototype consisting of subscale fairings and test samples."

Materials selected for the nose fairing will have been extensively characterized (or will be in Phase II) to reduce risk in the extended life-time application. The nose fairing will be designed with a similar profile, weight, and center-of-gravity to the existing fairing in order to streamline integration into the Trident life-extension program.SDC will be teaming with Mentis Sciences, subject matter experts in RF materials development, design, and manufacturing and possessing in-house testing capabilities that will be leveraged to quantify radio transparency of candidate materials and the nose fairing design. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor on Trident missile, has technically reviewed SDCs approach, and provided their technical support of the Phase 1 program."

Landfills are unsustainable and have potential to contaminate groundwater, while incineration consumes fuel and can produce hazardous airborne emissions. In response, we propose to develop a mobile plasma gasification system that will enable environmentally responsible and economical waste disposal. Our system will also produce more electric power than it consumes. Our team is well suited to succeed because we have a long history developing innovative thermodynamic systems for military and commercial applications, we have extensive plasma system expertise, and we have a strong commercialization plan. During the Phase I project, we will optimize design trades, complete a preliminary design, and estimate production costs. We will then fabricate and test a prototype system during the Phase II project."

The proposed unit leverages our existing py-SWRS pilot reactor that was developed for greenwaste processing at fixed DOD installations. Pyrolysis produces a liquid fuel that can be stored easily (unlike producer gas from gasifiers) and used as need to provide heat and\/or power. Furthermore, the emissions from pyrolysis (and subsequent combustion of pyrolysis oil) are significantly lower than emissions from incinerators or open burn boxes. MEC has demonstrated conversion of mixed waste, simulating waste from small base camps, using our existing 1 ton per day pyrolysis reactor and characterized the product. The proposed effort is to adapt the py-SWRS for preprocessing, drying, and complete conversion of mixed waste with low emissions. The waste preprocessing and pyrolysis systems will be packaged in deployable Tricon containers capable of 1,500 lb\/day. Phase I will include component modifications to tailor the current system to the Navy mission requirements, testing with a Navy-defined solid waste feedstock, and design and layout of the Tricon-packaged units. Phase II will culminate in the delivery of a technology demonstrator to the Navy for further testing."

In the course of this overall program, GridBridge will develop a three-phase, bi-directional energy router that will serve as a power flow controller and be the cornerstone for advanced intelligent microgrids within Naval facilities. GridBridge plans to incorporate its experience in the single-phase bi-directional MV conversion and translate those successes into a three-phase, MV Energy Router for the Navy, with both three phase AC and DC connections. In Phase I of this project, the team will complete and demonstrate two critical hardware stages of the overall system, demonstrating three-phase, bi-directional power flow and control as a proof of concept for a more complex Phase II design. This modular deployable device will serve as as an expandable microgrid gateway and incorporating cutting-edge cybersecurity capabilities for the existing traditional power grid."

        "abstract": "While the concept of a microgrid may seem straightforward, the actual implementation of the hardware and controls can be complex and difficult to integrate with the available equipment. Of particular annoyance is the vast set of contingencies that must be accounted for to ensure the controller operates safely in the event of equipment or device communication failures.The development of control algorithms, contingency handling, and human-machine interface can consume surprisingly large amounts of time and human resources. The costs associated with control algorithms can dwarf the cost of the control hardware installation.Faced with these issues, we propose the design and development of a system that would automate the creation of the control system for microgrids. This system would generate a set of rules and algorithm templates that can be used by a commercially available microgrid controller. These templates are based on the equipment identified by the controller during the initial system commissioning. In effect, the controller would be overlaid on top of the microgrid equipment (switchgear, generators, and other hardware) and would, with minimal user input, identify and implement the salient routines that initiate microgrid mode (and return to grid-tied mode) when appropriate. The system would also be capable of setting up the framework to offer any potential ancillary services to the local utility, thus providing an additional revenue stream to the facility operator. The automated process would execute a large number of routines designed to handle the various operational contingencies anticipated with the installed equipment, while forming a user-modifiable GUI that acts as the human-machine interface."

A micro-grid can operate with power from the grid, or by itself (islanded) when isolated from the utility. Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) will develop the active power control elements of such a system in this SBIR. A key element in this system is a grid-tied inverter at medium voltage. DTI proposes to use lower-voltage devices connected in series, a technique we have fielded for over 20 years in radar and high energy physics applications. The system will provide full control over the grid interface (both receiving and returning power), of renewable energy use, energy storage (e.g., battery charging and power use), sag correction, VAR compensation, fault protection, and local facility power sharingall at sub-cycle speed. This will allow optimization of NAVFAC and commercial renewables and storage resources, and allow power cost minimization by avoiding peak charges and taking advantage of peak rates to sell energy to the grid, as well as providing control over power management during grid outages or disruptions."

The system proposed will be able to reach a height of 100 feet above an average tropical forest canopy to deploy a solar array capable of generating 250 W under AM1.5G 1-sun illumination. In this proposal, MicroLink will evaluate and down select from two different deployment approaches. One will consist of a collapsible boom made of lightweight composite material that can extend to a forest canopy and a highly efficient solar array that can deploy at the target height. The other will consist of a ground based projectile launcher with a solar panel payload that will deploy once it reaches its peak height and then rests itself on top of the canopy. Both will feature a solar array with 1 m2 of active solar cell area, generating 250 W of power 24 VDC under AM1.5G 1-sun illumination."

Meeting these requirements is extremely important since the proliferation of modern technologic devices has brought a higher energy demand, therefore creating a dangerous and onerous burden on fuel and batteries re-supply missions. Mid plans to provide a new type of energy source for the Marines, one that uses biomass material (wet or dry) to provide heat by incineration in order to drive an energy conversion mechanism which will output electrical power. Mid plans to initially investigate the size ranges of 100-200 W and 20-40 lbm. Through the use of modern modeling tools to optimize the engine, as well as new and more advanced materials, Mid believes that the required energy densities from the BISCEP engine can be met."

This proposed system is based on novel integration of omnidirectional optics, thermal imaging sensors, and image-based bullet trajectory detection and backtracking. Innovative use of omnidirectional reflective optics provides 360 degree coverage and accurate range and azimuth measurements; novel integration of uncooled thermal imaging sensors supports passive small arms fire detection. As a result, the COMCOS system offers a compact, man-portable, cost-effective, and accurate sniper detection solution for the Marine Corps. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the COMCOS system by designing the system architecture, developing and integrating its major hardware components, and developing the main software modules. POC will develop practical plans for Phase II maturation of the COMCOS system and its tests and evaluations. In Phase II, POC will gather additional live-fire data for use to refine and optimize the COMCOS prototype. This prototype will take advantage of low risk, proven technologies and show the distinct path to transition COMCOS technology to Marine Corps use."

        "abstract": "The ability to determine the source of enemy fire is invaluable for neutralizing the threat rapidly. Besides minimizing further damage, the long term effect is that it will require the enemy to shoot from increasingly difficult positions to eliminate immediate, accurate return fire. Therefore, there is a need for an innovative low cost solution which is passive and requires no line of sight to the source of the fire. As the topic description clearly articulates, most existing technologies have significant limitations (acoustic systems suffer from multipath, optical augmentation is not passive and requires line of sight to the source, muzzle flash detection requires line of sight to the source, etc.). Solutions based on Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR) sensors are feasible, but impractical for widespread use due to cost. There are two possible approaches to meet this need: a) develop low cost sensors with the appropriate infrared band sensitivity, or b) leverage existing low cost sensors (such as bolometers) and augment their capabilities with innovative image processing algorithms so that the desired information can be extracted. Intelligent Automation Inc. proposes to develop SPOTTER, a low cost Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) and localization system suitable for dismounted soldiers during tactical movement."

We have developed new capabilities to sense fast moving low observable objects at ranges greater than competing larger pixel sensors. Based on proven technology, Cyan Systems will develop a unique small pixel high resolution digital output MWIR sensor that will be hybridized to a high operating temperature (HOT) mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) detector array using advanced small pixel interconnect technology.

        "abstract": "In order to be an effective EM radiator, monopole antennas must be ideallywavelength. For HF frequencies, this can result in a significantly long radiator. This long radiator, when deployed, can accidentally contact a HV source such as an overhead power line. The results of such a contact can be devastating for the radio operator and potentially nearby soldiers. Because of this threat, a simple solution has been to deploy the antennas with a protective covering. Although effective, this approach leads to a bulky and cumbersome solution. To overcome this issue, QorTek proposes to modify currently used whip and blade-type antennas to avoid catastrophic HV contact. The proposed method involves inserting a mechanical fuse-like element between the antenna components with an additional protection being provided by a high voltage capacitor. This simple device will easily include itself within the multi-component whip antenna while requiring slight modification for insertion into the blade antenna. Upon contact, the mechanical fuse element will trigger instantly removing the contact point and thereby avoiding dangerous consequences. With this modification being an add-on, the damaged end can be quickly replaced to yield full-service capability or the antenna can continue to be continued to be used with reduced radiating efficiency."

The impetus of the proposed work is to identify and evaluate protective materials that greatly reduce the risk of electrocution without sacrificing antenna\/communications performance. The success of this program rests on the following criteria: 1.) Create a rugged, low-friction antenna cover that insulates the radio and user from electrical shock; 2.) Design a lightweight, easy-to-install concealment system that immediately integrates to the existing whip and blade antennas (in the field or in depot), and 3.) Suppresses visual cues to enemy combatants. Material properties and characteristics include abrasion- and wear-resistant; low coefficient of friction, and lightweight. However, it is bulky and inconvenient for Marines who need to maintain a tactical, mission-focused state of readiness. METSS proposes to assist MARCORSYSCOM in the development of integrated antenna protection system. The development effort will focus on designs that allow easy application of the antenna shielding to Marines operating down-range or deployed in logistical depot."

EDEN will combine commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hollow fiber-based filtration unit with COTS UV bio-sanitization components, along with our unique, low-power desalination approach, in addition to water quality sensing capabilities. Use of the new desalinator will guarantee that EDEN, lacking the high-pressure components of reverse osmosis units, is lighter, cheaper, and more portable, making it an ideal choice for small (squad or platoon) size water purification system. The integrated device will operate automatically, producing drinkable water from local sources of contaminated and salt- or brackish water. Requiring 6 gallons\/hr of potable water from seawater, while reducing turbidity and eliminating microbiological contaminants. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of EDEN by developing a scaled design of its desalinator and integrating and testing a prototype of a water purification system, reaching TRL-4. This experience will be utilized in constructing an optimized prototype in Phase II (TRL-6)."

Vesitech, Inc has developed a totally new class of water treatment technology utilizing novel hybrid capacitive deionization electrodes which is ideal for this problem. These new hybrid CDI electrodes have a much higher ion capacity and a much more rapid regeneration which if successfully developed in the Phase I, will greatly reduce energy and weight requirements for ion removal.

The proposed NVD is based on unique integration of POCs four key technologies: (1) common-aperture achromatic optics, (2) sensor integrated display light-engine, (3) see-through holographic achromatic waveguide, and (4) low-latency pipe-line electronic processor. The innovation of the ULTRA-DNVD system integration will provide significantly low SWaP, wide field-of-view, and high dynamic range imagery over day, night, and degraded conditions. By providing a 1:1 unity magnification sensor\/display optically parallel-aligned imagery in an offset-free common line-of-sight, the augmented see-through display will provide an enhanced on-the-move situation awareness with symbology overlay of on-soldier sensors and data. In Phase I, POC will develop the design of ULTRA-DNVD addressing the Navy and Marine Corps needs and requirements, and demonstrate feasibility by SWaP analysis, optical modeling and laboratory subsystems demonstration. In Phase II, POC will refine the design and develop scaled prototypes reaching TRL=5, and test and validate performance for evaluation of its capabilities in a relevant environment."

Six15 Technologies proposes an innovation to tile and couple full color, high brightness reflective micro-displays with highly transmissive, wide field of view head mounted display optics. The proposed innovation would fill a void in Military and Commercial markets for high resolution augmented reality displays suitable for a wide range of ambient lighting environments. Development of light security methods is also proposed for the benefit of the Military market specifically. The work proposed for Phase I includes research and experimentation designed to validate the feasibility of the approach and justify progression to Phase II development. A Phase I Option is also proposed to expedite the Phase II work. Proof of the critical method will be delivered as well as refined estimates of the size, weight, and power of a concept implementation. A detailed Phase II plan will be also be developed during Phase I."

The proposed MAFLS is based on half Fourier echo-planar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, which enables fast response time and sampling rate to collect flow data. By using time-efficient half Fourier techniques for reconstruction, the latency in image acquisition is shortened, which also improves the resolution, making MAFLS capable of discerning the presence of water, gas, and\/or steam flowing within a 19-in. diameter, short ("

        "abstract": "When a payload exits a submerged launch tube, pressurized gas follows the ejected projectile into the surrounding water and expands between the tube and the upward moving projectile. The gas cavity behind the moving body then deforms and pinches off from the tube and then collapses with the formation of a strong upward reentrant jet. The impact of the high-speed reentrant jet on the projectile presents a threat of damage and imparts an unwanted force to its motion. Previously attempted high speed photography of the reentrant jet has not been successful due to the highly opaque and turbulent bubbly region surrounding the cavity. In order to alleviate this deficiency, we propose in this SBIR to combine high speed video observations of the cavity dynamics with pressure measurements in the water at several locations and impact pressure measurements on the projectile base. The optical method will provide the exterior shape of the evolving cavity, while the acoustic method, combined with a CFD computation of the cavity shape evolution for different input conditions, will enable reconstruction of the reentrant jet shape evolution in space and time using inverse problem optimization techniques that process both the acquired video and the acoustic information. The system will be tested and validated in Phase I using an available small scale uncorking setup in a vacuum tank and then scaled up for the field tests."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Chalcogenide glass fibers are commercially available and are used for delivery of mid-infrared wavelengths (1.5um to 6.5um).  These fibers allow compact, robust and low-weight laser platforms designs.  Laser systems in high-power and high-stress environments find their reliability and performance limited due to free-space optical components.  Free-space components suffer from vibration and thermal issues that can be eliminated by employing optical fibers as means of beam guidance throughout the platform.  Current state-of-the-art chalcogenide fiber production yields fibers with good optical qualities and consistent mechanical properties.  However, chalcogenide fiber mechanical strength and optical transmission could be improved significantly by reducing impurities introduced during glass and fiber fabrication.  The proposed effort will demonstrate the feasibility of developing materials improvements to current chalcogenide glass and fiber fabrication processes that will increase fiber strength and decrease transmission losses.  These novel processes will surpass current state-of-the-art yielding chalcogenide fibers with improved mechanical and optical properties capable of handling high-power and high-stress environments typical for IRCM laser system applications.  Chalcogenide fibers could replace free-space optical components in military, industrial and medical applications in need of better performance and reliability under high-stress, high-power environments.  ; BENEFIT: Development of chalcogenide fibers capable of low-loss (20kpsi) and capable of working under harsh environments is of great benefit for military applications, especially for next generation infrared countermeasure (IRCM) laser systems.  These fibers would be able to replace free-space optical components currently employed on laser platforms.  These platforms find their reliability and performance limited under high-stress and high-power environments, due to its free-space components.  Chalcogenide fibers allow a platform with improved reliability and performance, immune to vibrations present in high-stress environments, capable of handling high-powers which effectively removes the limitations currently set by free-space optics; while also offering platforms with reduced cost, weight and size.  Additionally, industrial, medical and other military applications would benefit from the improved chalcogenide fibers.  Applications such as: chemical sensing, laser surgery, long-range detection, etc.; are some examples.  Also, these fibers can be utilized to develop fiber-optics devices for mid-infrared lasers.  Quantum cascade lasers are an attractive laser source covering the whole mid-infrared region, chalcogenide fibers with a transmission window covering the whole mid-infrared would be of great benefit for such laser sources."

Integrating context information within a fusion architecture to reason cohesively about scenes of interest has tremendous promise for refining the decision space, thereby improving decision accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. The Deep Inference and Fusion Framework Utilizing Supporting Evidence (DIFFUSE) program will produce a mathematical framework, founded on rigorous probabilistic analysis and learning theory, which will result in accurate modeling of information across different targets in the scene and context-dependent high-level semantic representation of target labels. In Phase I we will: (1) develop a probabilistic modeling and learning approach to model multi-sensor data and context-dependent target label correlations; (2) develop inference algorithms based on fused multi-sensor data and context for multi-target classification; and (3) demonstrate the implications of the proposed algorithms under various target classification scenarios. The results of the Phase I program will demonstrate the feasibility and promise of the DIFFUSE system concept to be realized in Phase II.  Approved for Public Release  16-MDA-8620 (1 April 16)"

Future performance will rely on multiple sensors such as ground and sea based radars and electro-optical and infrared sensors for target recognition. It is crucial to develop a multi-sensor framework capable of processing the wealth of information these sophisticated systems can provide while also accounting for missing, noisy, or corrupted data. ExoAnalytic Solutions has partnered with Oregon State University to develop an advanced multi-sensor, multi-information -driven classifier for robust threat identification. We propose to do this through a unique combination of innovative advances in deep, hierarchical machine learning together with recurrent Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) methods for sensor fusion and Dynamic Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBNs) for whole-scene and contextual reasoning.

Integrating these sub-systems into the SoS, can result in dynamic interactions between these sub-systems and the SoS controls resulting in unexpectedly large deviations between expected and real performance that can be unacceptable or unstable resulting in significant costs or time to fix. Further complicating the problem is the possibility that one configuration of the SoS may perform as expected while another configuration may perform unacceptably.  During Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of applying Control Theory to a complex SoS by first identifying and describing the fundamentals of the interaction between sub-system, control loops and the high-level command and control (C2) decision-making framework. We will apply these fundamentals to develop a new set of analyses and design tools that quantify these effects across SoS integration reducing the time and effort required for sub-system integration into new and existing system of systems frameworks.

This is particularly true in the missile defense scenario, which involves a coordinated defense against threats. However, there is no existing theory that can guarantee stability and performance of such networked control systems. To address this need, Intelligent Automation, Inc. and Stanford University, propose to develop a control theoretic framework for analysis and design of system of interacting control systems. This framework leverages on our teams prior work on developing sufficient statistics for optimal control of multi-agent systems. These statistics were developed for certain problems of linear systems and extended to particular classes of nonlinear systems as well. In this effort, we will further generalize the results to more general classes of systems and extend them to complex nonlinear and Multi-Input Multi-Output systems. We will study the computational aspects and trade-offs between performance and approximate solutions. This effort will lay the foundation for systematic control, design and analysis of complex real-world SoS with nonlinearity, uncertainties and communication delays.

The central benefit of this approach is that the outputs passed back and forth between interconnected systems\/simulations can be modeled as an uncertain system.  The range of expected values for the parameters passed between the coupled systems can be specified along with ranges for possibly destabilizing intersystem gains, time-delays, and lags to any Hardware in the Loop (HwiL) systems.

        "abstract": "Antimonide-based Type-II superlattices (T2SL) are capable of delivering highly capable infrared detection capability. Improvement in material quality and processing techniques, as well as evolutionary modifications in device architecture have demonstrated the advantages of the material system over alternatives, and proven it as a viable candidate for the next generation infrared detection. Yet, the performance of this material system has not reached its limits. Further improvement in T2SL-based device performance is desired. One particular technical challenge limiting the utility of T2SL-based dual-band detectors is unwanted spectral crosstalk. Some potential sources of spectral crosstalk include: Incomplete optical absorption of photons at one absorber due to broadband peak width, low quantum efficiency in each absorber region, radiative recombination of carriers generated by photons at band one and emitting into band two, and flawed device barrier architecture. In this project, we propose to study the spectral crosstalk in strain-balanced antimonide-based type-II superlattices for dualband LWIR detection and imaging. At the end of this effort, we expect to minimize the spectral crosstalk in these devices while they demonstrate excellent electrical and optical performance.

Critical to any application of these models and of interpreting experimental results is the ability to determine solder joint gold contamination percent by weight.  Phase I will explore non-destructive methods for plating measurement and gold content calculation, and perform destructive analysis to verify the optimal method for determining gold content in solder joints of physical samples.  The gold content prediction methodology derived during Phase I will provide the basis for establishing an effective design of experiments to determine the long term reliability effects of various levels of gold contamination.  In Phase II and beyond, DfR Solutions and RIT will perform the required testing and create mechanistic reliability models.

        "abstract": "Gold contamination in Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) solder joints leads to brittle intermetallic compounds (IMCs), which is one of the major factors in solder joint failure. The conventional rule of thumb considers 3 wt% of gold (Au) as a safety threshold, which is not always reliable due to varieties of package platforms, solder types, reflux settings, operational and environmental conditions, etc. Accurate assessment of solder reliability requires physical understanding of solder behavior under realistic loads and boundary conditions. In this Phase I project, Intelligent Automation, Inc. proposes to develop a modeling and Nondestructive Testing (NDT) combined framework for Au content detection and solder failure likelihood prediction. In the proposed framework, NDT data of Au distribution will be imported into a multi-scale model integrating Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Peridynamics (PD) for crack initiation and growth analysis. An efficient stochastic algorithm will be utilized to interrogate the numerical model in the random space, generating probabilistic failure prediction toward the target sample and operation condition. Feasibility of the proposed method will be evaluated on representative solder joint specimens with different levels of gold contents.  Approved for Public Release  16-MDA-8620 (1 April 16)"

FE models, developed in Comsol Multiphysics and\/or ANSYS, will assess stress concentrations in the solder joint adhesion layer, as a function of time and as a result of fabrication and environmental stresses. KMC models will examine the dynamics of intermetallic diffusion in the solid and adhesion layer.

Traditional approaches are based on analytical predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), or numerical simulations using finite element\/boundary element. All those methods have difficulties studying crack growth, and need complicated re-meshing algorithms. In this work, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes to develop a novel computational framework for accurate modeling of crack\/fatigue initiation and growth in solids, using the framework of phase-field modeling. The approach will yield the crack topology in response to loading conditions, by means of the solution of the governing equations which are cast in a minimization problem of the total energy from elastic, plastic contributions. Phase I will develop the underlying theory, simulation framework and demonstrate its use."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this research project is to develop computational modeling methods that are able to describe the propagation and interaction of fatigue cracks using the phase-field methodology within the numerical framework of isogeometric analysis (IGA). Fatigue cracks initiate and grow in aircraft components under service loadings. Accurately predicting this failure mechanism is a critical aspect of the design process. Existing techniques based on finite element fracture models are commonly employed. Unfortunately, these models usually fail to accurately capture complex three-dimensional characteristics of fatigue crack initiation and growth, employ many ad hoc mechanisms to predict crack growth, and ignore the influence of microstructural effects. Additionally, expensive mesh generation strategies are required to manage the evolving discontinuities resulting in algorithms which are intractible in three-dimensions (i.e., solids) and for complex geometric configurations. The phase-field methodology overcomes these deficiencies and has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling the evolution of microstructures and the interactions of defects in a wide range of materials and physical processes. Isogeometric phase-field methods benefit from exact geometry, higher-order smoothness, local adaptivity, and the potential to be employed in fully unified design-through-analysis frameworks where the results of analysis can immediately inform design changes."

The proposed PFM computational framework accounts for both brittle and ductile fracture, including crack initiation and crack growth. Existing PFM models of crack initiation and growth will be reformulated to account for ductile fracture as well as fatigue loading situation. Critical experiments will be performed during the course of this research where needed. The goal of this PFM framework is to predict both the growth rate and the path of fatigue cracks without ad hoc rules or conditions. We further investigate interaction of crack with materials microstructure such as grain boundaries.Proposed PFM framework will address geometrically complex phenomena such as microstructure-crack interaction, crack kinking and branching, crack closure and stress corrosion cracking. Solution for the PFM method will be obtained by finite element method. Extension of the numerical approach to include Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is also proposed."

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposed efforts is the development of a novel high energy reserve type lithium ion battery (LIB) based power source for gun-fired projectiles that can survive launch setback accelerations of up to 70,000 Gs and capable of providing power for weeks at very low temperatures as required for military operations. The proposed concepts also allow the development of highly safe LIBs for weapon platforms, military vehicles and other mobile and stationary platforms with shelf-life of over 20 years, and that can survive high flight vibrations of in excess of tens of thousands, and be stored at temperatures from -55 degrees C to 125 degrees C. The proposed groundbreaking LIB fast charging and performance enhancement technology allows the developed batteries to be charged rapidly at temperatures that are even lower than the required -55 degrees C and will also rapidly bring the battery performance to the room temperature levels. The proposed concepts have the potential of significantly advancing power source technology for gun-fires munitions and all other battery powered weaponry as well as for all mobile and stationary platforms. The proposed low temperature fast charging and performance enhancement technology should also have a significant impact in commercial market."

        "abstract": "As the Navys fleet of Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) continue to grow so do the desired capabilities of these systems. Of specific interest is the extension of range and endurance through the use of autonomous aerial refueling. This presents a unique challenge to the control law development of the UAS as autonomous refueling can be susceptible to many external variables including atmospheric gusts and tanker air wakes thus requiring sophisticated sense-and-correct control algorithms. These methods hinge on the ability to properly characterize the receiver aircrafts response to both wakes and environmental gusts.As a step toward enhancing receiver aircraft characterization and control laws Corvid Innovation proposes a unique, innovative, and simple toolset for building aircraft aerodynamics models in the presence of leading aircraft wakes. Through a synergistic combination of low-fidelity aerodynamic tools, high-fidelity CFD aerodynamic predictions, and fast running simulation tools Corvid will demonstrate a successful approach that will provide resultant receiver aircraft loads from a spatially varying aerodynamic flow field."

        "abstract": "Existing ultraviolet laser diodes with wavelengths much shorter than 355 nm suffer from poor performance. This is partially due to limited research in this area, but a large part is also due to material and processing issues unique to deep UV lasers. New approaches to achieving III-Nitride UV lasers at wavelengths shorter than 355nm are needed to meet the Navys ambitious goals of having 1 W of CW output power; traditional approaches to III-Nitrides are unlikely to be able to achieve the desired laser performance. Instead it is necessary to develop revolutionarily novel approaches to the growth and fabrication of Al(In)GaN based UV lasers. This proposed effort will involve studying the growth, processing, testing, and demonstration of high power UV multi-quantum wells and lasers. It will cumulate in the initial demonstration of UV lasers and a feasibility study for pushing this technology toward even higher powers. This work will lay out the ground work for a Phase II effort in which we will continue to implement novel approached to demonstrating high-power UV lasers."

As is the case for most military laser applications, the size weight and power of the device is critical for widespread adoption of the technology. In addition to the defense and military applications, there are also significant opportunities for medical and chemical sensing applications. Unfortunately, compact, high-power, UV laser sources are difficult to realize using traditional sources. There are many types of UV laser systems currently available, but limitations on output power, tunability, large size, or expense limit their widespread use. TPhotonics Inc. proposes to use a patented novel modified t-cavity design, which incorporates vertical external cavity surface emitting laser (VECSEL) technology, to realize high-power UV outputs in a reliable and compact package. Using a high a power multi-chip VECSEL design efficient intracavity sum frequency conversion will be achieved to generate the desired UV outputs using no active cavity stabilization."

        "abstract": "Modern aviation platforms and systems must be able to provide sustained operations in a wide variety of environments. These systems must be able to operate for extended periods in severe weather and marine environments, undergo large temperature extremes (desert to arctic conditions) and dust environments, and are subject to high vibration and shock environments. The systems are often required to perform well beyond normal maintenance and inspection cycles. These conditions lead to multiple forms of failure, including metal fatigue and cracking, particularly around mechanical fasteners and their corresponding holes. Existing condition based maintenance systems such as the HUMS are able to collect data critical to monitoring the physical condition of the aircraft or platform. This data is used to develop prognostics so that maintenance personnel can determine the useful life left for a platform and when repair services need to be initiated. Recent developments in radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology coupled with very low power, miniature eddy current sensing techniques provide a unique opportunity to develop in-situ crack sensors that can be co-located with the fasteners. This research will explore and develop this capability for use with condition based maintenance and vehicle health monitoring systems such as the HUMS."

        "abstract": "Composites are increasingly used in components for defense applications as well as commercial structures. They are generally exposed to microstructural damage and thermo-mechanical loading, leading to physical property degradation. It is a very challenging task to predict all possible failure modes (matrix cracking, fiber breakage, delamination) because damage initiation and its progressive growth are very complex, and commonly accepted methods have had limited success. There is no existing analysis capability that can predict all possible failure modes in composites under multi-axial loading conditions and multiple-load paths. A nonlocal peridynamic theory overcomes the weaknesses of the existing methods, and it is capable of identifying all of the failure modes without simplifying assumptions. It effectively predicts complex failure modes in composites under general loading conditions. The proposed method will employ peridynamics to predict failure modes and damage paths as well as the residual strength of advanced composite structures under static and cyclic loading conditions. The predictions will be validated and verified by comparison with existing data and other methods."

        "abstract": "Submarine applications for antennas are severely constricted by mission constraints for stealth and force protection. High fidelity fiber optic links could potentially open a new range of mission capabilities by enabling towed antenna arrays that could be accessed while submerged. However, to date RF photonic links have had insufficient noise performance and\/or dynamic range to satisfy these mission requirements. To this end, PSI proposed a series of component and link architecture developments that will provide improved performance over the existing state of the art. Specifically, PSI will utilize its expertise in high bandwidth lithium niobate modulators and high-linearity MUTC photodiodes to establish a baseline of performance that can be achieved using traditional link architectures that exceeds existing commercial solutions. This effort will be dovetailed with explorations into optically downconverted links that utilize injection locked lasers to convert the received frequency down to baseband directly in the optical domain, where very high photocurrent detectors can be used for enhanced link performance. Furthermore, vertically integrated optical phase locked loop receivers with delays times on the order of femtoseconds will be explored to realize high dynamic range links with phase feedback that have previously been limited in dynamic range improvement and operational bandwidth."

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are 3-dimensional coordination solids composed of metal cations and organic linkers and, due to their substantial porosity and tunability, are of great interest for a wide range of gas adsorption application such as CO2 capture. Our recent work led to the development of a new class of MOFs with dangling amines grafted onto framework open metal sites that exhibit high-capacity, highly selective, cooperative adsorption of CO2 and enable far lower recycling temperatures and regeneration energies than currently accessible with conventional aqueous amine solutions. The initial development of these materials will involve optimization of synthetic variants and eventual pellet\/granule processing with the goal of identifying and producing the best materials to meet the Navy criteria for achieving an on-board background CO2 level of 0.5% (or less), maximal space and volume savings, and long-term stability to humidity and recycling."

Continuous passive characterization of refractive effects upon visible, IR, and radio\/RADAR electromagnetic propagation through passive relatively inexpensive multiband IR camera observations is enabled with the apparatus and methods proposed herein. Passive remote sensing of profiles, structure, and gradients of refractivity, temperature, and water vapor in the troposphere can be obtained through multispectral observations, or alternatively, measurements at a number of observing elevation angles, or both. The methodology proposed herein is a new approach and utilizes both methods in heretofore unused infrared observations to maximize independent measurements and therefore skill, in obtaining said tropospheric structures. The system is capable of a very rapid, 30 Hz, frame rate of over 300,000 pixels of 0.04C infrared temperature resolution. This information is inverted mathematically into high vertical resolution tropospheric structure. The profile informations obtained can be utilized to model the refractivity environment in all EM wavebands, from low frequency radio through ultraviolet. The profile measurement skill greatly exceeds that of microwave radiometric methods of profiling."

        "abstract": "DC cryogenic flow systems such as Joule-Thomson (JT) or turbo-Brayton require very high effectiveness heat exchangers to reduce input power, while also requiring the heat exchangers to have low SWaP-C. Cryocoolers for applications approaching 1 K and below demand very high efficiencies when placed on power sensitive platforms. In cryogenic recuperators this is ideally accomplished through transverse conduction of heat from the hot side to the cold side. However, cryogenic heat exchangers are inherently susceptible to performance penalties associated with parasitic heat conduction within the plane of the heat exchanger walls (i.e., parallel to the fluid flow direction). Micro Cooling Concepts, in cooperation with Ceramatec, has developed a concept that utilizes materials with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity to fabricate a microplate heat exchanger with an ultra high effectiveness (&gt;99%) for cryogenic applications with operating temperatures in the 1-10 K range. The proposed cryogenic heat exchanger utilizes a composite assembly of lightweight ceramic and metal. The program will consist of heat exchanger design and analysis, material fabrication, proof-of-concept prototype fabrication, and thermal testing efforts."

        "abstract": "&quot;Unlike reserve batteries, ultracapacitors have a very high characteristic power density, roughly 10 to 100 times greater than reserve batteries, but have relatively low energy density, limiting their use as a standalone power solution for missile defense applications. However, when coupled with a reserve battery optimized to store the required energy for the mission, this hybrid battery-ultracapacitor (HBU) system will have optimized power and energy densities, enabling significant power source miniaturization and weight reduction without sacrificing runtime or power delivering capability. FastCAP proposes to develop an ultra-high power density and high voltage (3.5V) ultracapacitor capable of surviving over the wide temperature range of -60C to 200C, and exhibiting gravimetric and volumetric power density of 120kW\/kg and 150kW\/L, respectively. FastCAP will design and prototype a hybrid system comprised of the proposed ultracapacitor in parallel with a reserve battery showing at least 50% volume reduction compared to stand-alone reserve batteries meeting military requirements. The ultracapacitor will be a symmetric device comprised of vertically aligned carbon nanotube electrodes and a highly conductive ionic liquid gel electrolyte. The HBU prototype will be engineered to withstand high shock (70,000Gpeak) and vibration (60Grms) conditions. The HBU system will be assembled in a single optimized package.&quot;"

This benefits persons with disabilities and also enhances servicemen responsiveness in high work-load situations.Lynntech proposes to develop geospatial haptic feedback on COTS tablets or smart-phones using a new technology that provide a very natural feel within a very small form factor and has low power requirements. The proposed haptic technology, which has no moving parts and is practically invisible to the user, is readily integrated in existing devices and is already available, providing a very short path to product development. Weight, power, form factor, natural feel, and ease of use are only few dimensions to consider in developing an effective user interface for portable devices. Lynntechs solution is superior to existing haptic feedback devices that are often limited to vibrations or have other moving parts, which make them less suitable for portable devices. In Phase I Lynntech will team with researchers at Texas A&amp;M University to determine the optimal haptic representation of geospatial information required by the Army and will provide a demo of the proposed product which will be developed for production in Phase II."

Tangible Haptics LLC is proposing to apply a new technology that allows for control of both direction and magnitude of the in-plane forces felt by a users fingers while exploring a touch screen. Control over both the direction and magnitude of fingertip forces is important because it opens up a vast realm of haptic affordances and interactions that have not previously been feasible. Moving beyond today&apos;s vibrational alerts and confirmations, Surface Haptics will be an integral user interface tool to convey information and tactile visualization. Control of in-plane lateral forces will be achieved by combining our Haptic One Glass Solution with our ShiverPad technology. During this phase I effort we will also develop methods for rendering geospatial elements such as textures, shapes, and contours."

        "abstract": "Linearized inflow models have been used to represent dynamic wake effects with great success for aiding control law development and flight dynamics investigations on conventional single-main rotor \/ tail rotor rotorcraft, but are difficult to extend to alternate configurations such as coaxial rotors or tiltrotors having significant interacting wake effects. By contrast, state of the art real-time free wake analyses can support manned flight simulation on all rotorcraft types, but are not readily used within control law development, as they are not formulated in a state-space representation as ordinary differential equations. The proposed investigation will leverage CDIs CHARM free wake analysis to evaluate methods for extracting a linearized model of the aerodynamics for a wide range of rotorcraft, to help support stability analysis and control system design activities. Since the underlying vortex-based model can compute far-field induced flow effects, this same linearization process will be extended to model interference effects on other aircraft components. The resulting tool will provide both enhanced fidelity for linearized aerodynamic representations of alternate rotorcraft configurations, as well as provide a consistent transition path for analysis of nonlinear response behavior using the full CHARM analysis in simulation settings."

One developing technology that could potentially fit this niche market are spark ignited heavy fuel, rotary diesel engines that can provide from 10 BHP to 50 BHP per rotor, have best brake fuel consumption less than 0.5 lbm\/bhp-hr, and have an engine power density of 1 hp\/lbm for small ground vehicles. A major challenge with such engines is the combustion system development, of which the ignition system is a critical element. This is due to the ignition source&apos;s direct contact with injected fuel and the complex fuel and air flow path characteristics. There are significant performance and reliability gains with a high energy ignition event at low engine speeds and startup, compared to low ignition energy at high speed conditions.

From this data one or more cells will be designed, built and demonstrated, including all key required materials and design developments needed (development\/selection of anode, cathode, electrolyte\/separator) as well as the manufacturing process. The new charging protocol will be specified and demonstrated and an appropriate charger designed and demonstrated. The cell capacity will be greater than 0.5 Ah, with 3C cycle-ability at -30oC and scalable to 24 volt or larger applications.

        "abstract": "The superior strength-to-weight ratio of composites has prompted expanded usage in tactical missiles. However, increasing mission demands are driving the need for higher performance from lower cost composite materials. Matrix resins used for production of tactical missile composites evolved from strategic missile applications, where cost and production rates are less critical. In response to this need, TRI\/Austin is developing a low-cost hybrid matrix resin that provides elevated Tg, and high fiber strength translation. The matrix resin will be formulated to achieve glass transition temperatures of &gt;400F, while retaining the ability to be processed via traditional composite fabrication processes. Catalysts will be included in versions intended for resin transfer molding (RTM) and other high throughput production environments. Resin rheology and cure kinetics will be determined, and carbon fiber laminates will be fabricated to confirm composite mechanical properties. Resin cost analysis and estimates for continued raw material availability will also be established. TRI\/Austin brings experience in the field of rocket motor composites development and testing. The development team also includes two prominent tactical weapon system suppliers, a primary provider of tactical solid propulsion products, and a major designer and manufacturer of precision engagement defense systems for the U.S. and allied militaries."

        "abstract": "To meet the objective of developing a design and fabrication strategy for producing low-cost, high-performance thermoplastic structures that contain highly detailed features for missile and aviation applications, Materials Sciences Corporation (MSC) will develop the technical data and analysis tools to implement hybrid material systems. In order to achieve this objective, MSC will leverage prior experience from SBIR programs that have focused on fabrication, analysis, and design of compression and injection molding of fiber reinforced material systems. This experience has enabled MSC to identify two material systems of interest that offer the potential to span the spectrum of performance requirements necessary to develop hybrid missile and aviation components. The first system is a thermoplastic hybrid system that maintains all of the benefits of fiber reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites (TPMCs), e.g., improved damage tolerance, virtually unlimited shelf life with minimal storage requirements, recycling options, etc. The second system consists of a two stage cured, hybrid thermoset\/thermoplastic prepreg that is compatible with thermoplastic overmolding; the system overcomes limitations associated with TPMC prepregs, e.g., tape width, drapability, etc. Since the selected hybrid systems are viable commercial products, the program can focus on applied research rather than costly and often unproductive basic research on material development."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for real-time measurement of prompt-gamma and prompt-neutron doses from a nuclear blast, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new neutron and gamma radiation dosimeter (NEUGARD). The proposed NEUGARD is based on an innovative wide-bandgap semiconductor structure combined with a neutron converter and moderating layers and charge-sensitive controlled integration time electronics. Using wide-bandgap semiconductor material, NEUGARD is capable of integrating or accumulating radiation-generated charge with high accuracy for a longer time. Using controlled integration time, NEUGARD provides real-time measurements of radiation with an extended dynamic range of 0.05-3000 cGy. In Phase I, the feasibility of NEUGARD will be demonstrated through (1) design and fabrication of a breadboard prototype in laboratory environment, achieving Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4; (2) testing of the breadboard prototype against prompt-gamma and prompt-neutron environment, and (3) review and analysis of data to determine the feasibility of the proposed technology to meet the Armys need. Based on the Phase I effort, POC will further develop and demonstrate, in Phase II, NEUGARDs capability to accurately measure prompt-gamma and prompt-neutron doses in real time through high-fidelity breadboard validation in a relevant environment, reaching TRL 5-6."

Present dosimeter technology including PIN diodes for prompt neutrons and RadFETs for prompt gamma radiation can provide this information more accurately if appropriately upgraded and utilized. In this work, RMDs dosimetry and materials experts will team with experts at Canberra and utilize the UDR-13 platform to make an upgradable system with an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over the existing system. Utilization of the existing sensors will allow us to test a high TRL device in Phase I and calibrate out temperature and process dependent fluctuations in the sensitivity. An upgradeable system offers the potential to drastically reduce the costs to the government of implementing this advance in capabilities, while establishing a clear path to manufacturability and deployment of both the upgrade and a completely new unit for both military and first responder use."

Phages offer highly specific bacterial detection and identification of biological warfare agents and antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria and built-in replication, while LFI provides a diagnostic platform that is easy to use, inexpensive, and disposable with little or no equipment required for analyses. An assay that combines the advantages of phages and LFI and exhibits reliable and robust operation and storage in austere environments is desired. Triton Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a simple, low-cost, rapid, fieldable bacteria detection system that uses lateral flow immunoassay. The performance of the bacteria detection system will be evaluated after different exposure times to austere storage conditions to determine the stability of the device. If proven successful, the technology will be adapted for DoD-relevant bacteria including Bacillus anthracis in phase II."

Over the course of the study, stored phages will be suspended and evaluated with respect to viability and functionality, using a combination of assays. During the Phase II Research Period, we will expand the capabilities of our system to detect additional biological threat agents. Our objective is to develop a phage-based system that can be used as a medical countermeasure and function under extreme environmental conditions.

This reduced-order model will be used to obtain estimates of the interaction acoustics in our numerical framework. The efforts dedicated in Phase I towards the development and validation of this framework for noise assessment for the fundamental configuration will provide the ideal launch-pad for testing, substantiating and refining the model further in Phase II and beyond. These numerical modeling efforts in Phase II will be complemented by experimental measurements on more representative propeller-airframe designs and configurations. Development of strategies for scaling the reduced-order model to be more representative of full-size systems will be initiated in the Phase I program."

This streamlined and user-friendly inflow noise modeling tool will be called the Installed Propeller Noise Model (IPNM). The Techsburg\/AVEC team will leverage their prior experience and existing codes and knowledge base from design, modeling, and testing of pusher propellers in the Virginia Tech Anechoic Wind Tunnel over the last three years during the base Phase I software development work. During the Phase I Option, the team proposes to carry out a set of validation wind tunnel experiments during the Phase I Option portion of the work. Prior work on propeller systems for fixed-wing pusher propeller aircraft will also be used to better understand technical challenges for design of propeller systems for compound helicopter applications."

        "abstract": "The efficient modeling of acoustic interaction between wake generated by lifting and control surfaces, with a propulsive flowfield of a pusher propeller configuration forms the focus of this proposed SBIR project. Modeling these effects involves complex, high fidelity, and high performance computing simulations that tend to be cumbersome and time consuming. Multiple realizations of coupled response is needed for practical problems in order to explore the design space, quantify interaction mechanisms, develop control algorithms or perform design optimization. Recent developments in reduced basis methods provide means to perform large and expensive multi-parameter simulations using dramatically reduced computational effort (sometimes several orders of magnitude), while not compromising on the accuracy of the physical model (no approximations in physics).We propose here a systematic maturation of reduced basis modeling techniques in airframe (specifically, tail) aerodynamics and pusher propeller configurations in both fixed wing and rotor aircraft. We will explore the use of interacting low dimensional models, in a single multiphysical framework. This work will be based on recent developments at HyPerComp and elsewhere in the model reduction for unsteady nonlinear processes in gas dynamics. Phase-I research will establish a baseline methodology, to be extended and demonstrated in a potential future phase."

If Successful, these new composites will have significantly higher strain-to-failure (~5 percent), higher specific strength, and higher specific modulus, all of which are critical for aerospace structural applications. MATECHs approach is to use a highly modified Carbon Nanotube (CNT) based yarn with significantly improved strength, stiffness and toughness.These composites, based on nano-crystalline diamond (NCD)-bonded CNT preforms, can be shaped and densified with toughened epoxies or other matrices to produce a suite of advanced components and composite systems.This SBIR program could potentially result in breakthrough lightweight composite materials for aviation, automotive industry, and other transportation sectors which benefit from improved performance and a concomitant reduction in weight. This Phase I SBIR program benefits from the active support and participation of MD Helicopters, Hexcel Corporation, and the American Boronite Corporation."

Our solution addresses the stated processing performance objectives, strives to wholly satisfy US Army expectations comprehensively, and is well positioned for success within the Army, broader DOD, and commercial industry.Specifically, we shall apply fusion and probabilistic modeling to automatically distill the nuance of registered 3D data from multi-source, multi-format FMV streams. That logical operational structure will:1. Ingest FMV and strip out KLV tags for timestamp and location for each frame.2. Probabilistically associate each subdivision of the working region with image pixels across the entire video stream.3. Statistically combine the volumetric information to hypothesize 3D registration.4. Refine the camera parameters based on the probability models and EKF results.5.

Specifically, the innovation in architecture with pre-computed data and fast algorithms will enable the PRIMP to efficiently render 3D realistic imagery to warfighters. As a result, this technology offers high situational awareness and real-time operation in low SWaP processing hardware, which directly address the Army requirements.

        "abstract": "Complex RF electromagnetic devices such as phased arrays have traditionally been very expensive to fabricate due to the difficulty of routing radio frequency (RF) signals, electrical control signals and electrical power. Several additive manufacturing approaches have been developed to produce either conformal array fabrication technologies or complex interconnection technologies but none yet have achieved both with high power handling. Additive manufacturing methods are enticing because complexity is not strongly correlated with cost, rather cost is driven more by material volume (i.e. machine time). Toyon proposes to develop an ElectroMagnetic 3D (EM3D) printing technology based on a gantry motion control platform which can manipulate multiple processing heads based on existing Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing technology. FDM can print with flight and space qualified thermoplastic resins such as PEI and PEEK. Toyon will augment the existing FDM process with new extrudable materials which have tuned electromagnetic properties. The proposed approach will use the Laser Direct Structuring (LDS) method for selective metallization of the 3D printed polymers. The EM3D printing process will feature integrated structure, cooling channels, RF and electrical routing. The use of high quality engineering polymers and metal will be able to produce flight qualified functional prototypes."

The effort to develop the dynamic vehicle model will accommodate software and hardware advances through a modular, plug-in framework, ensure interoperability with external modules and applications through an open, well documented and stable API, and leverage existing modeling and hardware technologies.The generalized fidelity formulation will allow the simulation community to determine the adequacy and suitability of the dynamic vehicle model for their specific simulation implementation and application, including testing of EO\/IR sensors.The dynamic vehicle model techniques and tools may function either stand-alone or in combination with other client users."

A secondary desire is to vary output energy from 1 to 10 mJ, with a limit of 500kW. Fibertek has developed a novel approach to meet both of these goals. Fibertek will also develop a design for electronics control and cooling and a Graphical User Interface. Fibertek has a long history of developing small laser designators including the introductionof diode-pumped lasers to the military market. Fibertek was also heavily involved with the development of athermal lasers and laser larkers. A central thrust to laser designator and marker development is the use of shorter than historical pulse lengths for laser designators. This device will allow the Army to quickly and accurately test seeker heads with varying pulse widths and energy levels. This will allow development of shorter pulse lasers to continue to proliferate, reducing the size, power and weight of equipment carried by the warfighter."

The goal of this research proposal is design a laser at 1064 nm with adjustable pulse width ranging from 2 ns to 160 ns. The PRF of the laser will be also adjustable from 8 Hz to 75 Hz with ultimate goal of 100 Hz. This newly proposed laser at 1064 nm with adjustable pulse width and PRF is based on hybrid technology of fiber lasers and diode-pumped, solid-state laser amplifier. A Labview or Matlab program will control all the parameters of the laser including the pulse energy, pulse width and PRF. The seed laser diode spectral line width will be broadened from 1 MHz to 1 GHz using a commercially available Coherent Control Module in order to mitigate the SBS issues that plague all fiber lasers with large pulse width (&gt;5 ns). The duration of the optical pulses and PRF will be determined by electrical signals applied to the Mach-Zehnder modulator. A 3-stage Yb fiber amplifier will be used to boost the energy from nJ to a few hunded uJ. A final last stage diode-pumped, Solid-State amplifier"

In Phase I, we will establish the feasibility of the approach by demonstrating the synthesis of ligand free, water soluble QDs with emission quantum yields greater than 30%, while in parallel, developing a system model for the excitation and detection of the QDs. We will validate the system model via proof-of-concept fluorescence imaging of the QDs applied to precision machined defects in steel coupons. In Phase II, we will pursue QD material scale-up and develop an advanced penetrant system prototype that includes an applicator for applying the QD penetrant into bore holes and a rugged fiberscope for imaging QD emission. At the end of Phase II, we will demonstrate the ability of the penetrant system to quantify the crack depth of bore evacuator holes based on QD emission intensity using Government furnished gun tubes."

This program will result in the development of an automated laser-based scanning system that utilizes colloidal Quantum Dot (QD) technology.QDs are unique, nanoscale materials that can be engineered with a variety of absorption and emission wavelengths, making the filtering of the excitation light much easier to accomplish, as well as and ligands that enable QDs to bind to a variety of solvents.The extension to laser-scanned FPI with QD technology will result in a NDE process that has the potential to revolutionize the inspection of parts by providing rapid inspection by significantly reducing the issues of process complexity and operator dependency, while eliminating materials that can damage the test components.This program will directly impact the US Armys ability to inspect high-value, safety-critical assets, and has significant potential value for extension to commercial assets."

        "abstract": "CISS proposes a sensor that combines a Shortwave Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging (SWIR HSI) sensor based on Dual Polarization Conformal Filtering (DP CF) with a Raman HSI capability equipped with a Fiber Array Spectral Translator Spatial Heterodyne Spectrometer (FAST SHS). This multimodal system, called M-SHIELD, will provide real-time standoff detection and identification of explosives, from residue to bulk levels, while also offering features that ensure full-spectrum deployability, sensor fusion, and low cost.SWIR HSI provides a rapid, wide area targeting capability while Raman HSI provides a unique molecular fingerprint that allows for unambiguous target identification. To address eye-safety concerns, the proposed effort will incorporate a FAST SHS. SHS is a slit-less spectrometer similar to a Michelson interferometer, but requires no moving parts. Merging FAST with SHS yields a novel wide-area hyperspectral Raman sensor capable of yielding high spectral resolution in a small form factor while using defocused (i.e., eyesafe) laser excitation. By combining DP CF SWIR HSI with SHS-FAST and by fusing the associated data, offers a revolutionary, portable approach to detecting and identifying explosive threats within 50-100 meters."

        "abstract": "Detection and neutralization of explosive hazards including Home Made Explosives (HMEs) and Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) is an important problem for U.S. Army. IED attacks accounted for 62% of all U.S. casualties in Operation Enduring Freedom and are now accepted as a significant threat to homeland security and the U.S. forces all over the world. Hence, from a detection perspective, a capability to detect a wide range of military and HME explosives used in IEDs is needed.Several methods, ranging from spectroscopic, colorimetric, chemical, optical and luminescence based techniques have been applied to detect explosive hazards at levels varying from micro to milligram per cm2 (trace) to grams per cm2 (bulk). However, there is no one technique that has all the features required for widespread deployment. Many of the spectroscopic techniques suffer from high cost and a medium to large footprint which constrains their use, and some employ laser illumination which raises radiation safety issues.TDA Research Inc (TDA), in collaboration with Texas Tech University (TTU), proposes to develop a low cost rapid multimodal stand-off trace explosive detection device to provide reliable detection and identification of the class of the explosives fromtrace vapors and surface residues."

Formal investment in portable inspection equipment for crack detection is important as it will likely be useful throughout the Army.TRI\/Austin proposes to develop a multimodal NDT device, using two complementary modalities, to examine flaws in internal surfaces of holes in steel structures.TRI\/Austins NDT Toolbox software for analyzing, manipulating, and fusing NDT data will be used to decrease false positives while maintaining detection reliability.NDT Toolbox can also assist in creating probability-of-detection curves."

        "abstract": "A bore evacuator is generally used in gun barrel of armored fighting vehicles to help prevent poisonous propellant gases from venting back into the fighting compartment. It consists of a ring of holes drilled into the barrel, surrounded by a cylindrical pressure reservoir. Under typical operating conditions, pitting corrosions and stress corrosion cracks can form in the inner walls of those drilled holes. Current methodsare time consuming and labor intensive. Additionally, the detection of stress corrosion cracks is often plagued\/hindered by the pitting corrosions coexisting in the holes of the bore evacuator. In the proposed program, AlphaSense details the development of a novel multimodal inspection tool to detect and quantify the cracks present in the internal surfaces of holes in the bore evacuator. If successful, the merits of the proposedinspection toolinclude the following: a) Compact, lightweight, and low cost, b) High inspection throughput, c) High sensitivity for crack detection, d) Capable of differentiating between pitting corrosions and cracks, and e) Capable of inspecting both straight and angled holes."

        "abstract": "Nondestructive evaluation of internal surfaces of holes or pipes in steel structures, such as evacuator holes in gun tubes, for the presence of surface flaws such as stress corrosion pits and cracks is a difficult task, particularly when the internal space is small, the structure is large and rapid inspection with high precision is desired. The process is further complicated by the presence of surface features such as pits, which can be difficult to separate from true crack indications. While this dilemma can be prohibitive to any single technology, through a fusion of two methods it is possible to enhance detection capability. JENTEK proposes to test and compare two surface topology mapping methods (such as MWM-Array surface mapping or an optical or capacitive sensing method), each in combination with the MWM-Array crack detection method. The trade-offs between performance, cost, and inspection time will be evaluated. A framework for data fusion will be developed which will simplify data analysis for the end user.Using the surface topology images, surface features such as pits will be used to filter the MWM-Array data to enhance crack detection and suppress noise.Feasibility of delivering a rapid, low cost, and practical solution will be demonstrated."

Prof. K.P. Rajurkar, Distinguished Professor of Industrial Engineering and Director of the Center for Nontraditional Manufacturing Research at the University of Nebraska will serve as a consultant to the program. ECM is a manufacturing technology that allows metal to be precisely removed by electrochemical oxidation and dissolution into an electrolyte solution. As described in Prof. Rajukars keynote paper to the International Academy for Production Engineering, ECM has numerous advantages relative to traditional machining including 1) applicability to hard and difficult to cut materials, 2) no tool wear, 3) high material removal rate, 4) smooth bright surface finish, and 5) production of parts with complex geometry.In spite of these advantages, Prof. Rajurkar noted five research challenges preventing the wider adaptation of ECM. The proposed Multiphysics tool design platform for prediction of optimal ECM tool shape with minimal empirical iteration addresses the two remaining research challenges defined by Prof. Rajukar, (1) tool design and (2) machining accuracy."

ECM tools have traditionally been designed by trial and error, which is time-consuming and expensive, making the process optimization and project management very difficult. The ECM process itself is extremely complex, involving changing potential and current density fields, thermal effects, reacting multi-component flow and gas evolution, combined with the dynamics of tool motion.Objectives of Phase 1 are to demonstrate the feasibility for using FEA (Finite Elements Analysis) multi-physics software to determine, upfront, the necessary shape of an ECM cathode tool to achieve a target component shape and finish. Corrdesa will leverage expertise in corrosion simulation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to deliver the envisioned end state of a generic, software platform able to take as input, material properties and specified target geometries and deliver as output the required ECM cathode tool shape and operating conditions.To demonstrate the accuracy of our cathode tool design software, we will build a bench scale ECM rig and the designed cathode tool to manufacture a first-part geometry comparing its shape and surface finish with the targeted criteria."

        "abstract": "InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to develop Super-Hydrophobic Coatings with Anti-Reflection properties (SHOC-AR).SHOC-AR involves formation of a nanostructured, surface relief patterned superhydrophobic, and biomimetic coating on metal and glass surfaces. Femtosecond laser pulses will be used to create surface relief structures on firearm material surfaces, such as steel. The in-situ textures of firearm surfaces with different surface relief patterns will be utilized as the microscale feature of this coating. Moth-eye anti-reflection surface relief structures can be fabricated directly onto glass substrates, such as on the curved side of plano-convex lenses. In Phase I, ISL will develop SHOC-AR technology and demonstrate feasibility by applying it on G43400 (4340) steel and plano-convex lens material coupons. Surfaces of steel plates and tubes (inside and outside) to be used would represent a gun bore. In Phase II, we will downselect candidate processes, then optimize, scale-up, and tailor the material to specific U.S. Army programs. We will also investigate superhydrophobic coatings for glass, steel and other engineering alloys applications. During Phase III transition, ISL will work with prime contractor and U.S. Army groups representing our entry market to establish testing requirements for coating certification."

Specifically, the Army is in need of laser treatment technologies that will be able to treat large surfaces as well as difficult geometries in efforts to prevent corrosion and deterioration of its military arsenal and equipment. Current, anti-corrosion technologies are limited to chemical surface treatments which are generally passive treatments but can also be active; however, most of these coatings require maintenance or reapplication as the chemical bond between treatment and surface is not strong. In the proposed Phase I effort, Materials Modification, Inc. (MMI) will show proof of concept of a pulsed-laser technology that will be able to create microstructures on the surfaces to promote anti-corrosive\/superhydrophobic properties, highly cost-effective, and imparts anti-reflective properties. The surfaces treated with pulsed-laser technology will be evaluated for anti-corrosive, self-cleaning, and mechanical properties. Phase I Option efforts will build upon the Phase I findings to scale-up the pulsed-laser technology to treat large-scale surfaces and determine processing parameters for specific geometries. Phase II efforts will be focused on developing a portable pulsed-laser technology for use in field applications on military equipment as well as other alloys."

        "abstract": "Several future weapons, including Railgun, and other directed energy systems rely on pulsed electrical power to deliver energy to the target. Pulsed power increases the performance, accuracy, and repeatability of Electrothermal Ignition (ETI) projectiles by delivering precisely-timed, powerful ignition pulses to high-energy, propellants. Electrothermal Ignition has been demonstrated with ETI Pulsed Power Systems (ETIPPS), however, challenges exist in delivering the pulses to the recoiling components of the gun. These systems must have rugged designs to survive the shock and vibration environments required for mobile deployment.Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) proposes to develop a compact, high energy-density ETIPPS capable of operation while rigidly mounted to the recoiling gun components. This system will build on the 6.5 kV, 300 kW, 2.5 MW\/m3 power converter developed for the Navy Railgun as well as energy storage, switching, and pulse forming designs derived from DTIs modulators. This design will provide elimination of the flexible link between the power source and gun barrel, and will transfer mass from the platform to the gun barrel, thereby reducing recoil.Under this effort, Diversified Technologies, Inc. will develop a compact, high-shock 6.5 kV, Power Converter and Power Delivery System capable of being rigidly mounted to the recoiling gun components."

This solicitation is focused on reducing the ETIPPS footprint to harness the benefits that this technology can offer to future combat vehicles.IAP is proposing to shrink the size by designing a 20 kJ ETIPPS, which is a 5X reduction of energy from past systems.Additionally, we will study the feasibility of a pulsed power supply that is capable of withstanding high jerk environments.Proposal tasks include the development of a cost effective simulation tool that is able to determine survivability of internal structures and materials exposed to ballistic shock conditions."

The current material of choice for shaped charges is either copper or molybdenum and for EFPs is Ta\/Ta alloy because of their appealing combination of strength, density, ductility and favorable high strain rate behavior, and relative safety in handling. High purity and uniform microstructure lead to a better ballistic performance. However, refractory metals, such as Mo and Ta\/Ta alloys, are challenging to manufacture into appropriate shapes and Ta\/Ta alloys are quite expensive. Our approach is to use thermodynamic modeling to design new stable nanocrystalline Ag-based alloys, and then use high energy milling to refine the microstructure of the powder material for the selected compositions and consolidate these powders into bulk, fully dense, nanostructured material. This effort will use thermodynamic modeling to identify potential Ag-based alloys compositions, and combine our unique expertise in high energy milling and instrumented-Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) to develop bulk nanostructured Ag-based alloys for next generation shaped charge and EFP liner applications."

        "abstract": "Toyon Research Corporation proposes to design, fabricate, and characterize a high-Q, gallium nitride (GaN) varactor diode for a tunable bandpass filter application. GaN has not received much attention in this area and Toyon feels that it is worth an investigation. GaN is used for several new electronic and optoelectronic devices so the manufacturing base and reliability of the material is strong. Toyon has completed simulations of a device with a 4:1 capacitance range, a minimum predicted Q of 212 at 2 GHz, and a bias range of 9.5 - 35 V. The elevated bias range will strengthen the IP3 performance of the filter. Toyon will design and simulate a 5-pole filter tuned from 1.3 - 2.7 GHz that uses five of the varactors. All of the varactors will tune in parallel so that only a single tuning voltage is required. Toyon will procure GaN wafers from a commercial vendor and fabricate devices at the UCSB Nanofabrication Facility. The epitaxy and devices will be characterized in one of UCSB&apos;s mm-wave labs. The Nanofabrication Facility and mm-wave lab are available to commercial users at an hourly rate."

Eliminating the threat of loss of lubrication and elimination of mechanical frictional tribological mechanisms found in typical helicopter rotor mechanism allows increase in transmission life expectancy, robustness and dramatic increase in reliability. Vishwa concept can enable future scaling up to the power class of a utility, attack or cargo class helicopter.

SA can improve security, survivability and optimize lethality.The object of this SBIR is to develop a dual-mode transducer that provides both bone conduction (BC) sound transmission and vibrotactile cues.The merit of each technology alone has been shown to enhance performance and SA:The sense of touch can convey information that would otherwise be conveyed using visual or auditory pathways, and bone conducted audio can convey radio communication in a manner that does not degrade auditory SA of the external environment. Together, a unified bone conduction\/vibrotactile device can be expected to ease the burden of information overload on the Warfighter, whether used alone or in conjunction with the traditional visual and\/or auditory channels. Based on our extensive prior experience in the design, development and application of vibtotactile transducers, EAI proposes to combine both technologies in one electro-mechanical device, which is optimized for both a tactile and BC signal transmission, so the Warfighter can receive the benefit of both technologies from a single, convenient, small wearable device."

In Phase-I of the proposal we are demonstrating the reliability, repeatability, and reproducibility of the spin-spray plating process by depositing high Snoeks Product nanocrystalline thin film ferrites on Printed Circuit Board material. In the 4-month Phase-I option we will be demonstrating that these nanocrystalline ferrites can be implemented in devices such as an isolator or circulator. The supporting technology is a wet chemistry low temperature spin-spray plating process, demonstrated by ASU and Rayn Innovations that yields materials with a Snoeks Product twenty times higher than conventional bulk ferrites. Our enabling technology would not only integrate microwave devices into the same circuit board stack, they would also enable the integration of wide-band conformal and low-profile antennas into the same system, from VHF to GHz range. At the end of this project we will have determined: a path towards large scale manufacturing and ability to reduce production cost 10X over current technology, the understanding of process parameters that control the key properties of the ferrite such as deposition rate, pH, processing temperature, rotation rate, and flow rate."

        "abstract": "Integration of RF ferrites on printed circuit boards (PCBs) is highly desired for realizing compact, lightweight and low-cost systems in package (SiP) integrated with different RF components, including compact antennas and antenna arrays, tunable filters, phase shifters, isolators, circulators, etc. However, it has been challenging to integrate ferrite materials on PCBs. Spin spray deposition is a proven and viable method that is able to produce fully dense, high crystalline quality, and low-loss RF ferrites at a low temperature at a low cost. However, spin spray technique and facilities are not commercially available. Two major issues severely limit ferrite integration on PCBs by spin spray deposition: (1) limited ferrite film thickness of 5~10 m, low loss tangent 1GHz on large scale rectangular (2436) PCBs. At the same time, new compact integrated RF ferrite devices, antennas and inductors, will be demonstrated on ferrite coated PCBs."

        "abstract": "Metamagnetics addresses the Armys need for a new spin-spray deposition capability of uniform high crystalline quality, low-loss ferrite and thick ferrite\/insulator multilayer films onto large surface area PCB panels by developing an innovative extension of the spin-spray system to larger substrates (up to 24x36). These films will be optimized for RF\/magnetic properties, such as dielectric constant and loss tangent, permeability, remnant magnetization, uniaxial anisotropy, ferrimagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency and linewidth, magnetic softness, etc., as required for integrated RF device applications. Historically, the integration of ferrite materials in thin film form onto PCBs or MMICs has proven challenging because of high processing temperatures, risk of contamination of semiconductor fabrication processes or limited coverage areas. Our proposed large-scale spin-spray system brings the benefits of high-quality ferrite films with conventional micro-component technologies. The spin spray process is a low-cost, low-temperature, direct deposition ferrite plating method with a high deposition rate (up to 100 nm\/minute) and the ability to produce high-quality, high-density, crystalline, ferrite films. To-date, it has only been demonstrated on small laboratory scales and there is a critical need to develop this technique to accommodate large surface area PCB panel, which we propose to address."

We will demonstrate in the Phase I program the following material characteristics: free hole density of at least 2 x 1013 cm-2; surface conducting channel Hall mobility of at least 200 cm2 V-1 s-1; bulk thermal conductivity of at least 1200 W cm-1 K-1; and a 4 Angstrom or better RMS roughness. The toroidal plasma reactor which we have developed offers a significant advantage over more conventional microwave plasma reactors in that it is readily scalable to even larger dimensions for future applications and is much more compact, energy efficient and gas-efficient."

        "abstract": "The Department of the Army has identified long wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetry as a means for enhanced detail of human imagery for facial recognition. In addition, polarimetry has been shown to improve image contrast, detect anthropomorphic objects in high clutter scenes, and provide 3D shape information. However, many polarimeters operate using rotating polarization filters or retarders, which result in false polarization signatures in scenes containing movement.For non-cooperative targets, being able to capture the polarization signature of a moving target is essential.In order for the sensor to be operationally useful, the polarization signature must be measured in a single frame.This is typically accomplished using a microgrid polarizer array, in which each pixel has a polarization filter, much like the Bayer filters used on color cameras.However, features that are subpixel can still result in false polarization signatures.IERUS engineers have developed a micro-optic that can optically register the four pixels used to measure the polarization signature.The IERUS approach will integrate the optical registration micro-optic and microgrid polarizer with a cooled dual band IR camera to build the polarimetric sensor and associated processing hardware."

This radar will provide adverse weather detection in short ranges (greater than 15km) to support forward-area Precision Airdrop (PAD), aviation operations including landing zones and weather hazard warnings. The MPDR system will complement other atmospheric sensors such as Doppler LIDAR systems, demonstrating interoperability with existing power sources and computing nodes and eliminating custom support equipment that must be carried into the field. Software-defined radar transceivers and processing\/control nodes will allow for flexibility in the radar performance under different operating conditions and software-driven system upgrades, as well as extensibility of the radar sensor for other missions such as hard target detection for perimeter defense and air surveillance. The Phase I effort will focus on enumerating the strengths and weaknesses of various system architecture approaches and selecting and documenting an initial design approach that maximizes system performance while minimizing the SWaP footprint. The system design concept will be further refined in the Phase I option based on Army feedback and a prototype will be developed, built, and tested in the Phase II effort."

        "abstract": "To enable precise positioning capabilities in dense forestry areas, QuNav proposes to develop the technological approach of Positioning with Optical\/Inertial Navigation and a Tree-map Enabled by Radar (POINTER). POINTER implements global and local aiding of inertial navigation system (INS) using features extracted from images of electro-optical (EO) sensors (ladar and video camera). Global aiding (i) extracts tree trunks from EO imagery data; (ii) matches them to a geo-referenced map; and, applies matched trunk features to mitigate the INS position drift. Local aiding operates without a priori map information. Position and attitude increments that are computed from a sequence of ladar and video images are utilized for the INS drift mitigation. One key benefit of combining global and local aiding components is the ability of POINTER to operate with sparse maps since local aiding can be applied between absolute position updates.POINTER can be optionally augmented with deeply integrated GPS\/INS navigation (DIGINAV). DIGINAV employs long coherent integration to recover extremely weak GPS signals (30 to 40 dB below open-sky conditions). DIGINAV will not necessarily support a continuous position solution under dense canopy. Yet, fragmented satellite measurements can be still recovered thus providing additional updates to the overall sensor-fusion mechanization."

The proposal details how this knowledge of the key system parameters allows us to address such a complex and difficult system with a solution that can be fielded. The technical aspect keys on the need for isolation between transmit and receive in a full duplex system.

        "abstract": "Under SBIR Topic A16-033, Multi-Band Body Wearable Antenna (MBWA), the U.S. Army seeks a new body wearable antenna design capable of operating effectively in multiple radio frequency bands and with various modulation techniques to provide a minimum range of 0.5 KM when both the transmitter and receiver are situated in horizontal positions on the ground. The MBWA will need to operate effectively in 30 -88, 116174, 225450, and 450-512 MHz for terrestrial communications; and UHF SATCOM band (225-318 MHz circularly polarized) and L-Band (Soldier Radio Waveform). It is desirable that the MBWA can be remoted from the radio and the soldier (i.e.: hoisted into a tree) to increase communications range to 5 KM in heavily forested or triple canopy jungle environments.Prior to 2007, Wang Electro-Opto Corporation (WEO) developed several broadband conformal body wearable antennas with multioctave bandwidths, based on its broadband Traveling-Wave Antennas (TWA), which have been field tested by the Army with good results. Since 2007, WEO invented a new generation of TWAs for the exploding Mobile Wireless applications, such as the smartphones and tablets. Therefore, WEO proposes to develop an MBWA using these patent-protected TWA technologies which have reached TRL and MRL 4 to 7."

Given its substantial scope, FIRST RF recognizes that there is considerable risk involved in the Phase I effort. However, instead of starting from square one, FIRST RF will be able to leverage past work to meet the stated objectives of Phase I. Current dismounted radios provide larger spectrum capability than can be met by current body wearable antenna technology. The end goal is to fill the gap between radio capability and limited antenna bandwidth. FIRST RF will generate a comprehensive analysis package that looks at the SAR on the end-user at each of the operating frequencies in order to ensure occupational safety limits are not exceeded.FIRST RF has established the professional experience and the tools to accurately determine radiation exposure levels through both simulation and measurement."

        "abstract": "Wireless connectivity and situational awareness of warfighters are critical in current and future warfare. Maintaining network connectivity and achieving situational awareness require continuous exchange of information across the network, which eventually drives the need for reliable, high data rate communication links. The task of providing high data rate communication is ever more challenging for the Army with the need of providing connectivity in a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) framework which is known to have fundamental capacity limit. Inclusion of antenna array in MANET framework brings many challenges that have to be overcome.To address this challenge, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes to develop a Directional Antenna Control SYStem (DACSYS) for radios, without modifying radio waveforms. DACSYS is designed to support a wide variety of antenna systems in general and steerable parasitic antenna arrays in particular. DACSYS modules include hardware, firmware, and software. DACSYS hardware includes sensors for estimating 6 degrees of freedom (6 DOF) of position of the antenna system. It also has an FPGA and a processor to support signal processing and antenna control modules."

The digital-RF transmit side performs the reverse operation of the receiver, collecting and combining signals from basebands to form a set of composite transmit signals that are intended to be transmitted over different RF bands. We also propose to extend the analog interface to higher frequencies using either an analog or a discrete-time continuous-amplitude mixer."

Current design approaches rely heavily on the expertise of the designer and extensive experimentation and tuning. Soar Technology (SoarTech) proposes to develop a swarm engineering environment for the Design of Self Organizing Adaptive Robotic Swarms (DSOARS). By employing both a top down and bottom up constructive approach DSOARS will fundamentally change how reliable swarming systems are configured and deployed.Effective swarm design must address three core challenges: (1) Decomposing mission tasks into the appropriate atomic behaviors and interactions of the swarm entities to achieve the necessary swarm-level behavior, (2) adapting and tuning the size, configuration, and behavior of the swarm to the specific mission at hand, and (3) verifying that the emergent swarm behavior consistently achieves the mission goals with a high level of confidence.DSOARS addresses these challenges through two primary innovations: (1) verified swarm design patterns and mapping rules to decompose mission tasks into individual behaviors for achieving desired swarm effects and (2) a constructive test and evaluation environment that simultaneously optimizes and verifies a swarm configuration against a wide range of possible mission conditions."

        "abstract": "In swarms of social insects, simple individual actions can lead to the emergence of highly sophisticated collective behavior, capable of performing tasks that range from shortest path discovery to nest construction.Such collective intelligence has served as an inspiration to researchers in robotics, due to the high effectiveness of its underlying mechanisms.However, in adapting such mechanisms to concrete applications, it is necessary to solve a difficult inverse problem: given a desired collective behavior for achieving some goal, automatically generate a set of individual behaviors that will cause the collective behavior to emerge within a swarm of robots.To address this problem, Intelligent Automation, Inc., proposes to develop a system for automatically generating rules that govern individual actions through stigmergy and state sharing (S3).Stigmergy is defined as indirect communication through the environment, where an individual robot determines its action simply based on the observed actions of nearby robots.State sharing allows each robot to update its state based on the states of nearby robots; in turn, state affects which stigmergic rules are applied, allowing for effective coordination in both space and time.Our system will generate stigmergic and state sharing rules for achieving a wide range of swarm goals."

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for advanced, real-time, situationally-aware prognostic resource management software tools, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Predictive Smart-Grid-enabled Resource alerting and Management (PSGRM) system. PSGRM is an intelligent resource management solution that predicts future resource status through observation of current usage and real-time situational data (weather, etc.), and tempers this using historical data, thus bringing past experience into play. It is built around a novel predictive resource usage routine that estimates resource usage for current and future times. A real-time situational data module aggregates data from external sources and generates modifier values. Results are stored and used by the histrionics module for refining future predictions. In Phase I, POC will define the requirements and CONOPS, and architect the PSGRM system. We will then fabricate a proof-of-concept prototype and perform a demonstration to Army personnel demonstrating the ability to predict resource usage in response to real-time events, thus directly satisfying the solicitation requirements. In Phase II, POC will expand the capabilities and features, as well as debug and optimize the design. The final Phase II TRL-6 prototype will be ready for transition to productization for follow on Phase IIE\/III efforts."

The software framework, once integrated with the TEAMS toolset, will monitor mission activity (planned or ongoing) data streams to estimate power demands of mission systems, as well as detect and classify mission events (using a trained model from TEAMS-DMin (Data miner) that is automatically embedded in TEAMS-DE (decision engine)), forecast context-sensitive resource demands to meet the COA needs, and provide alerts when the demands exceed the capabilities for altering schedules, selecting alternative COAs, or reducing demands from low priority loads. While the specific focus of demonstration will be on predicting the energy and power needs for systems in a FOB based on forecasts of weather and tempo of operation, the software architecture is generic, modular and extensible in that it can be used to predict all aspects of mission-resource requirements."

To date, however, no AR approaches have been developed to support Mission Command (MC), despite the importance of MC to all Army missions. To apply AR in support of MC, Charles River Analytics proposes to research, define requirements for, and design and develop prototype Mission Command Augmented Reality Technologies to enhance Human User Readiness (MCARTHUR). First, we will conduct a Focused MC Work Domain Analysis to iteratively develop an inventory of the procedures, skills, and competencies relevant to situational awareness for MC. Second, we will conduct a Scoped AR Trade Study to catalog relevant insights into how humans perceive AR displays, the strengths and limitations of available display platforms and which HCI techniques have been successful for given tasks and contexts. Finally, we will develop a Geospatial AR Prototyping Environment to allow AR designers to quickly design and evaluate visualization and HCI techniques that can be readily transitioned across AR platforms as that technology evolves, and support demonstrations of targeted proof-of-concept MC ARapplications."

        "abstract": "Army Commanders often have only as much information about their environment as they can perceive with their own unaided senses and can mentally picture based on subordinate reports. Current tools such as Nett Warrior provide new ways of visualizing information, but require looking down into a computer screen. New tools such as augmented reality (AR) have the potential to make digital information more readily accessible while also allowing soldiers to continue to observe their surroundings. New AR technologies are quickly arriving in the marketplace and have the potential to improve commander situational awareness. However, there has not been a systematic needs assessment across Army warfighter functions, nor an assessment of the technology itself to meet the needs. To fill this gap, we propose to correlate Army warfighting functions against the current state of the art in augmented reality technology including visualization, imaging, and human computer interaction. We will assess situational awareness needs for commanders, the immersive needs for training, and ways to interact naturally with the AR information. We will select a specific application of these technologies that would have a broad impact across Army warfighter functions and conduct a deep analysis to understand the specific information and display requirements."

New technologies are emerging, specifically in Augmented Reality (AR), that show great promise to not only helping manage and share information to the Commanders at all levels, but also effectively increase their Situational Awareness (SA) resulting in the capability to execute missions with higher success rates, lower loss of life, reduced time frames, less necessary resources\/troops, and reduced fratricide\/collateral damage. The ultimate endeavor will be to provide an all-encompassing display approach for mission commanders that gives them the perfect gods eye view of the battlefield, as was imagined in the movie Avatar.Creative Microsystems Corp (CMC) proposes to research and develop a task specific AR system based on the Army Mission Commands requirements. CMC is an expert at integrating AR based systems and is currently developing several advanced see-through wide field of view display systems.

        "abstract": "High data rate digital focal plan arrays offer the warfighter improved situational awareness and target detection and discrimination. However, these benefits are difficult to realize because of high output data rates, high power dissipation, demanding cooling requirements, and limitations on data rates. The proposed 10:1, lossless, on-chip compression, cuts the data rate by an order of magnitude, and by doing so removes the key barriers from the implementation of much needed high performance sensors.Nu-Treks on-chip compression scheme is based on widely used image coding and compression schemes adapted to the specific data flow in digital readout integrated circuits (DROICs). It will also be optimized for typical Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) and Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) images and war fighter objectives. The compression scheme selected is especially suitable for on-chip implementation as it operates on a single row at a time and involves only addition, subtraction, and bit shifting (multiplication and division by 2), which are easy to implement on chip.Nu-Trek will leverage cutting edge in-house DVE and HFI DROICs to customize and optimize the compression scheme, implement the compression scheme in CMOS, and demonstrate the compression scheme in conjunction with high data rate DROICs."

Using a combination of lossless compression and high quality lossy compression, the proposed compressing scheme with enable high quality infrared imaging without requiring high data bandwidths, thereby requiring fewer LVDS ports and in turn reducing power consumption and thermal dissipation. The compression scheme can be readily used in conventional DROICs as well, thereby expanding its application spectrum to most Army and DoD applications. The proposed DPROIC with on-chip data compression will be a complete camera-on-chip architecture when combined with infrared detectors. The DPROIC will be implemented in a mature CMOS process with much more reasonable mask costs as compared to that of state-of-the-art line width processes, saving the government money and broadening the possible supplier base."

The overall effort in Phase I will focus on research and development of the experimental design and methodology for augmenting target acquisition performance measurement and experimentation. In addition, we will determine the metrics that will be used to evaluate probability of detection and time to detect. These metrics will in large part determine what and how testing must be conducted and with what type of hardware and software. We strongly believe that success in solving this critical problem will rely on a heuristic approach with significant input from our subject matter experts. Our goal for the proposed effort is to develop and demonstrate a proof-of-concept methodology in Phase I that can lead to a generalized fidelity formulation and prototype in Phase II. The generalized fidelity formulation will allow the simulation community to determine the adequacy and suitability of real-world augmented reality for their specific simulation implementation and application, including testing of EO\/IR sensors in various environments."

Moreover, the complexity of bourgeoning sensor technologies coupled with mission diversity requires a real-to-life, yet cost effective, target acquisition training solution. This efforts objective is to create an augmented reality (AR)-based target acquisition training and experimentation tool that provides comparative, human factors testing and validation of training technologies. Phase I includes a state-of-the-science review to identify AR technologies and authoring tools capable of facilitating EO\/IR target acquisition performance. A testbed experimental methodology to assess the integrated components using psychophysical measures to benchmark and predict Soldier performance will be identified. Results will be leveraged to develop and test a software suite that will automate the experimental design and assessment process. Grounded in usability engineering and combined with psychophysical measures, Phase II will test the prototype tool using Soldiers of varying expertise, performing within operationally relevant EO\/IR scenarios. Phase II outcomes include a validated target acquisition training scenario and an extensible automated experimental design software capability. Phase III will ultimately deliver an immersive, interactive, cost-effective AR-based training experiment delivery system focused on EO\/IR target acquisition."

Augmented reality (AR) enables the efficient training by allowing the Soldier to directly focus on the most important items within an EOIR sensor feed. Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop an experimentation capability for training the target acquisition process by integrating a real-time image processing technology to augment video, a geospatial representation of targets, landmarks, and other geo-referenced items, and a learning management system to enable higher level reasoning in the context of various missions and scenarios. In Phase I, Toyon will develop psychophysical experimentation architectures to identify the most critical training components to vary and stimulate in a live training environment. Toyon will develop a methodology for evaluating the responses to effectively train the Soldier for rapidly acquiring targets. Geospatial data will be displayed on the EOIR feed by using high-fidelity sensor models for estimating target locations. As a result, Toyons proposed approach is display agnostic and will embed on screen display data on existing real-time EOIR monitors."

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging at full short- and extended short-wavelength infrared spectral band (0.92.5 m) has important military applications. When used for imaging, a SWIR camera can operate at night using light reflected off the subject in the scene, generating high resolution images with details such as shadows and surface roughness. Compared to thermal infrared imaging, SWIR images look more like visible images and thus scene interpretation is much easier. Even on moonless nights, natural background radiation from the sky, called nightglow, provides useful illumination for imaging. Additional advantages include imaging through glass windows, some types of camouflage, smokes, fires, and haze with less attenuation than visible light. Many objects of military interest, such as explosives and chemicals, disturbed earth, terrain, and vegetation, contain rich and unique spectral features in the SWIR band. The goal of this effort is to demonstrate high-performance extended SWIR photodetectors based on Type-II superlattices. The detector performance goal is the following: quantum efficiency larger than 90% with anti-reflection coating, dark current density less than 710-8 A\/cm2 at an operating temperature 200K or higher."

        "abstract": "The extended short wavelength infrared (e-SWIR) wavelength band is a performance gap for infrared detectors. At both shorter and longer wavelengths, high performance detector technologies exist: SWIR InGaAs detectors (1.7 m cutoff), and MWIR (3-5 m cutoff) detectors such as InAs-based and GaSb-based Unipolar Barriers, MCT, and InSb. This program proposes development of high performance e-SWIR detectors with cutoff wavelengths in the 2.5 m range, based on lattice-matched InGaAsSb absorber layers on GaSb substrates. The design incorporates a unipolar barrier device architecture that enables the device to be free of the effects of surface leakage currents and generation-recombination dark currents. The design can achieve background-limited (BLIP) performance at T=210K, which is accessible by thermo-electric coolers. The program brings together unique skill sets of two small businessesAmethyst Research who specializes in infrared detector design, development and materials growth, and Attollo Engineering who specialize in FPA fabrication and camera integration. Phase I will demonstrate prototype devices exhibiting dark current 10 times Rule 07 and 85% quantum efficiency. In Phase II FPAs will be fabricated and will be integrated into a thermoelectrically cooled camera, to assess system performance."

        "abstract": "ISR collection management planning requires data from a variety of sources spread across a large disconnected, intermittent, and latency challenged networks. As a result, collection management planning relies heavily on the cognitive abilities of the Collection Manager to decide on the best coverage and application of ISR sensor platforms.Intelligent software agent technologies have the ability to help optimize the collection management plan by reaching across some of the boundaries created by the challenging network environment and combining the intermediate results of distributed agents. The COMPAS program was created to test the core concepts of establishing such a software agency. COMPAS software agents will communicate and reason according to a collection management planning ontology, and each specific type of sensor agent will be tuned to the specific parameters and capability set of their respective platform.The collection-plan broker (CPB) will establish a set of collection requirements that will be published to the agency. The agents will assess the set and provide useful metrics related to the requirements they are capable of meeting and the overall costs associated with meeting those requests. With the information provided by each agent, the CBP will identify the best ISR allocation plan."

The current ISR collection is heavily dependent on human guidance and experience to create an effective collection plan.This planning is reliant on the individual setting up the mission and frequently only accounts for the specific mission system that is being utilized.This creates gaps in coverage that can be mitigated by incorporating all available sensors in the mission area.By creating a network of all available sensors without being limited by security domain or mission platform, the entire network can be utilized.Intelligent agents communicate to ensure complete coverage and notify managers when there are gaps in coverage or detection of anomalous data to be investigated.If accepted by the Mission Managers, the sensors can then adjust coverage for complete coverage of the mission areas."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for a new simplified visualization paradigm, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Intelligent Unified and Intuitive Data and Information Visualization (INTUIDIV) system based on an innovative integration of three principles of content simplification: abstraction, augmentation, and registration. Abstraction transforms data or information to a familiar representation that simplifies and improves comprehension; augmentation modifies familiar symbology\/iconology to convey additional information at-a-glance with minimal impact to cognitive load; and registration associates content in a spatio-temporal fashion to convey patterns and unseen correlations. The innovation in implementing these three principles in a new visualization paradigm will convey intuitive information in an analog fashion rather than comprehending quantitative information, leading to enhanced global situational awareness. When desired, the user may drill-down for additional details through contextual pop-up menus and view changes, thus allowing lower-level granular exploration as desired. In Phase I, POC plans to identify and validate methodologies for optimizing a users ability to process large amounts of data including initial quantitative performance assessment using simplified data sets and scenarios. In Phase II, POC will develop and demonstrate a prototype system that will be tested and validated through task performance assessment."

Resilient Cognitive Solutions understands the underlying causes of that struggle, and how to avoid them.First, in order to increase cognitive performance the visualization techniques must be more resilient to novel situations and provide improved error detection and recovery. Users must be able to better cope under a variety of stressors such as data overload and alarm avalanches. Ironically, applying technologies often worsens the overload when they unintentionally add cognitive work to operate the system itself and increase data volume by adding alerts and messages. The challenge is how to add technology affordances that aid decision making without burdening the user. Secondly, the system must reduce overall cognitive load leading to a natural ability to function more effectively. The visualizations must transform the data into the required mission information to match the core cognitive work a user is performing. Lastly the system must allow a user to process and analyze the information presented without the added burden of managing multiple tools and widgets. The visualizations must be coordinated and be arranged to mimic the users functional understanding of the world."

Current available materials for infrared wavelength application exhibit poor obscurant performance due to the low mass extinction coefficients in the aerosolization. In this project, Luna Innovations will develop a new class of highly conductive carbon nanofibers that are precisely tailored in dimensions and conductivity for optimal performance as obscurant materials blocking the far infrared (FIR) wavelength. A unique fabrication process is proposed which allows preparing these high conductive carbon nanofibers in large scale and low cost. These carbon nanofibers with the desired dimension and morphology may accurately match the customer requirements."

Specifically in this SBIR, the tools should be able to identify long-term generator and power distribution performance degradation.It is not cost-effective nor is the data available to develop physics-based performance models on the myriad of generator sizes, applications, distribution, and age. Hence, we focus on evidence-based quantitative methodologies. Our technical objectives for this feasibility study are to:1. Collect operating data of a common diesel generator that is deployed across multiple configurations for both installation and operation energy needs.2. Apply methods such maximum overlap discrete wavelet transforms for feature extraction and filtering to determine the influence of environmental factors, grid interconnections, maintenance protocols, and similar external factors to create normalized time series for modeling.3. Develop non-linear diagnostic and prognostic models that identify change points for condition-based maintenance, determine remaining useful life, and uncertainty.4. Define a dedicated software solution that can reside on a commercially available power control system.In keeping with the stated purpose of the SBIR program, this project will produce fundamental research that can be commercialized for government and private enterprise markets."

Improved diagnostic and prognostic approaches that more accurately determine the reliability and performance of generator and power distribution equipment can advise the maintenance or replacement of power systems to prevent failures in critical situations, protecting against future threats. The Probabilistic Operations Warranted for Energy Reliability Evaluation and Diagnostics (POWERED) application uses rich, modular probabilistic modeling that advises reliability and maintenance of generators.

Parachutes become visual markers for enemy combatants to find the attached payload before friendly forces can reach it. Additionally, while airdropping Unmanned Vehicles (UV) the parachute has the potential to land on top of the vehicle, entangling the UV, covering important sensors impairing the UVs effectiveness, or altogether aborting the vehicles mission.Available research has indicated retracting the parachute can limit the parachutes visibility and footprint by reducing snaring, snagging, entangling of the canopy and steering lines, or parachute landing on top of the UV or payload. The addition of concealment\/ camouflage further reduces the possibility of alerting enemy combatants. Methods of concealment vary based on the type of material and size of the payload.Commercializing the combined technology of a camouflaged, retracting device has a wide range of potential markets and customers including other DoD customers, telecommunications industry, environmental agencies, humanitarian groups, and oil, gas, and mining industries."

        "abstract": "The threat posed by the effective delivery of lethal Chem\/Bio (CB) agents remains one of the key concerns in the defense against catastrophic attacks today and into the foreseeable future.There are many situations where a high pressure resistant, flexible, hermetic closure system is required to protect against such exposure.Conventional fastening options for such applications generally consist of zippers, hook and loop closures, or zip-track systems. However, these systems all include problematic drawbacks for critical applications. Among other deficiencies, zippers and hook and loop systems are inflexible, not decontaminable, and do not provide hermetic sealing for high pressure applications. Zip-track systems are difficult to install and use in field conditions, require secondary closures at the end of the track, and take on creases in storage which make them susceptible to permeation. We hypothesize that we can design and fabricate improved compliant closure systems which incorporate areas of interlocking microfiber\/microridge adhesive arrays inspired by the foot-hairs found on geckos with continuous elastomeric interfaces to provide excellent sealing properties, even for high pressure applications. In this project, steps will be taken to develop, prototype, and characterize this novel family of flexible fasteners, and demonstrate their effectiveness for CB protection applications."

These standard closures limit the usefulness of the CB protective system because these closures do not seal well, especially at high pressures and are difficult to use in the field.A new closure system is proposed that is flexible, seals at high pressure, is CB resistant, reusable, cost effective, and can be decontaminated using standard techniques."

        "abstract": "QuesTek Innovations LLC proposes to adapt its patented Ferrium M54 alloy for personal armor applications. The US Army Soldier Protection and Individual Equipment (SPIE) Program indicates the need for the development of Small Arms Protective Inserts (SAPIs) and Side Ballistic Inserts (SBIs) that will be able to protect the Soldier from threats such as basic small arms, sniper threats, and armor piercing threats while also providing a 10% weight reduction. This weight reduction is thought to be achievable via processes which will fabricate ultra-fine to nanoscale grains within the microstructure of the alloy, increasing the specific strength.In this Phase I SBIR program, QuesTek Innovations, a leader in the field of integrated computational material engineering (ICME), proposes to use an ICME informed test matrix to adapt Ferrium M54 to personal armor applications through fabrication of an ultra-fine grained, nanoreinforced microstructure. With its partners, Dr. Jonathan Montgomery, and Prof. Suveen Mathaudhu, QuesTek believes that Ferrium M54 is a good candidate for this application due to its high grain boundary cohesion, nanosized carbides, and high specific strength."

The government is interested in a new seat that can be internally mounted, multifunctional, and detachable, equipped with a restraint harness that, as a system, shall mitigate blast related injuries (overloading of the spine, pelvis, etc.) to the Soldier from explosive hazards. Our objective is to develop a seat that will protect and accommodate the Soldier in an event, and enable evacuation of an injured Soldier post-event without extraction from the seat. In Phase I, we plan to define and determine the technical feasibility of developing a blast attenuating seat that is lightweight and easily removable from the vehicle without special tools while stabilizing the Soldiers head and spine. The seat will protect and accommodate the central 90th percentile Soldier population while fully encumbered and be durable enough to handle the rugged conditions encountered by ground vehicles."

        "abstract": "In recent military conflicts, protection against vehicle underbody blasts has been a key survivability issue. Underbody blasts from buried mines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) have resulted in significant casualties. Despite the variety of occupant protection devices that have been, or are in the process of being, developed, significant injury risk still remains as a result of blast events. As such, in seating and vehicle design, it is important to consider how an injured occupant can be rapidly treated and evacuated post-event. Given the limited space within the vehicle, what is needed is a system by which the patient can be stabilized in the seat and extracted in the seated position. To this end, InnoVital Systems, Inc. (formerly Techno-Sciences, Inc.), in collaboration with ILC Dover and BAE Protection Systems, propose to develop the AirLift seating system. The novel AirLift system leverages the combined teams expertise in emergency medical devices, blast attenuation systems, and inflatable structures to yield a seating system that provides field-proven blast protection as well as rapid and stabilized patient extraction."

The resin requires measuring, mixing and application that may not be a common skill as it involves precise measuring techniques to assure full cure and mechanical properties of the resin matrix. Custom Technologies LLC will develop a repair method that utilize equipment currently issued to Army Soldiers and still achieve the desired performance goals of a structural composite repair required by the Army. Our work will develop a system that provides a reasonable repair methodology for the warfighter, guidance on storage and handling, surface preparation and application, with no HAZMAT waste to handle at the conclusion of the repair. The repair system will be packaged as kits and can be deployed by a distribution network already in place."

        "abstract": "The application of fiber reinforced composite materials into Army vehicle and structural platforms has generated a significant amount of research in recent years with the enhanced structural performance of the materials resulting in significant weight savings. One technical barrier inhibiting the insertion of these materials into service is the lack of well-defined repair methods for composites. Army Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) have tasked the small business community to develop repeatable, high-quality, insitu repair methods that maximize the life of these high-performance composite components and structures while minimizing the out-of-service time. Materials Sciences Corporation (MSC) will develop the necessary technical data for high-performance, Out-of-Autoclave (OoA) prepreg systems that may be processed in a wide range of operational environments using vacuum bag consolidation and elevated temperature cure cycles. MSC will leverage their experience in establishing OoA material processing standards for large-scale marine structures as well as their comprehensive composite damage\/repair knowledgebase to evaluate material systems and establish processing procedures that lay the foundation for the development of high-performance Composite Repair Kits which may be utilized throughout the Army.Furthermore, MSC and their composite manufacturing partner Seemann Composites Inc. (SCI) will develop classifications of repair for a given construction and associated internal loads."

Such a system should be able to operate in the harsh Abrams turbine engine environment which includes high temperatures, particulates, inertial shock, and vibration. The long-term objective of this project is to develop such a monitoring system module by heavily leveraging Sporians prior and ongoing DOD\/NASA funded work on high temperature smart pressure sensors for aerospace turbine engine control and performance monitoring.This Phase I effort will include: working with the DOD and OEMs to define requirements; analyses; evaluation of potential modifications and development of new system designs, and proof of principle demonstration of the proposed concepts\/components in laboratory scale tests."

        "abstract": "Current medical response training for non-medical Soldiers is provided during introductory Combat Lifesaver (CLS) training courses.Due to the inhibitive cost of medical manikins, in many cases, the practical training that is provided to CLS trainees is limited to low fidelity manikins, leading them to be ill-prepared to provide care on a high-stress battlefield setting.To meet the need of providing realistic training during force-on-force training activities, Design Interactive proposes the development of MedAR, a modular medical augmented reality (AR) training platform. Under the proposed effort, a training needs analysis will be conducted to define the medical training gaps and critical skills that an AR training platform can support.A review of the current state of the art for critical AR training components (e.g. optical see through AR displays, wireless audio systems, haptic feedback devices, physiological state models, and speech and gesture input systems) will be conducted to drive the design of a modular framework that supports alternate and future technology integrations.Proof of concept demonstrations of core medical AR capability will be created to drive the prioritization of component development and commercialization opportunity discussions with key stakeholders and transition groups."

        "abstract": "Luna, collaborating with a major engine manufacturer, is proposing to develop miniaturized, high frequency sensors that will measure the temperature at the surface of a piston during operation. The system is based on high frequency temperature sensors which have been demonstrated to have millisecond response time and survive the thermal and mechanical shock of similarly harsh environments. Modern military diesel engines operate at increased pressures and temperatures and are required to output more power compared to their civilian counterparts. The logistics surrounding the design of the piston to operate at the increased pressure and temperature require knowledge of the environment inside of the cylinder during operation. Current thermocouple based technology does not have the response time adequate to capture microsecond transients that occur during combustion which in turn influence the shape of the piston and the control parameters of the engine. During Phase I Luna will design and demonstrate a prototype data acquisition system and sensors in a small scale diesel engine. During Phase II the system will be optimized, integrated, and tested on a larger scale engine currently fielded by the Army. Phase III will transition the technology to the Army and commercial industry through Lunas Product Division."

The option effort will have extended the base effort to implement a final integrated lifecycle test optimization capability, where the focus of the research will have been on how the software components can be integrated to demonstrate the concept feasibility.

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for a high spatial fidelity scene simulator for hardware-in-the-loop testing, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new High-Fidelity Reconfigurable Dynamic Scene Projector (HIRASP) system based on a novel integration of broadband light sources, spatial light modulators (SLMs) and zoom projection optics with multispectral image co-registration. By innovative implementation of high dynamic range SLMs for pixelwise optical modulation and resolution enhancement, HIRASP enables large resolution (4k x 4k projection of dynamic scene (&gt;12-bit) at high frame rates (&gt;120 Hz). The modular design enables the projection of dynamic imagery over the broad wavelength range covering multispectral bands (i.e., UV, visible, NIR, SWIR, MWIR, LWIR), and also makes the system reconfigurable (projecting multispectral scenes simultaneously, in sequence, or selectively) and easy to set up and move. The zoom projection optics makes the system adaptive to the various fields of regard needed. In Phase I, POC plans to establish the technical feasibility of HIRASP by analyzing system and selecting an optimum design approach, developing top-level system design, modeling and simulation, and predicting the overall performance based on the choice of key simulator components. In Phase II, a working HIRASP prototype will be developed and demonstrated for evaluation."

        "abstract": "The objective of this SBIR development is to produce a high fidelity electro-optical simulator (HIFEOS) for hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testing applications. The developed system will overcome the limitations of the presently employed simulators with respect to the achievable dynamic range, spectral composition, and spatial resolution. During the SBIR Phase I development, a detailed feasibility analysis and a top-level system design of the simulator for HITL testing will be performed. The HIFEOS feasibility analysis will identify the major technical risks that need to be addressed during the development. The top-level HIFEOS design will focus on selection of the key components required for successful fabrication of the system prototype during the following phase. The phase I deliverableswill include a complete feasibility study of HIFEOS, incorporating details of the system-level design alternatives, performance trade-off analysis, selection of the optimum design approach, and the expected system performance based on the choice of the key simulator components. This will lead to an innovative solution capable of exceeding the spatial resolution and the dynamic range of presently employed scene generation systems. The Phase I results will provide a solid foundation and justification for the successful HIFEOS system prototype development during the following SBIR Phase II effort."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in commercially available Gallium Nitride (GaN) MOSFETS offer significant advantages compared to Silicon devices for a wide range of power conversion applications including the availability of devices in advanced packages, lower on-state resistances, significantly faster switching, and improved performance in harsh electromagnetic environments.To demonstrate these advantages of GaN in military platforms, PCKA proposes to develop hardware to demonstrate the application of commercially available GaN electronic switching devices to reduce the size, weight and power of low-voltage power conversion hardware within the Combat Vehicle Prototype (CVP) Next Generation Power Architecture.It is anticipated that the proposed converter will achieve the target power output capability with reduced size, weight, and cooing requirements compared to a similarly designed Silicon-converter.Further, it is assumed that all of these capabilities shall be met while maintaining or improving upon the safety, efficiency, robustness, and stability requirements that would be essential for a modernized combat vehicle.In the Phase I effort, key aspects of the proposed GaN power converter will be designed and verified through a combination of advanced modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A) and hardware prototyping and test to a degree sufficient to warrant transition to a more complete Phase II development effort."

        "abstract": "Current military vehicles use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) inverters to provide power from their 28 Vdc bus to 120 Vac loads. These COTS inverters are large and inefficient and do not meet all of the requirements for military grade electronics. This proposal details efforts to develop an isolated, two-stage GaN based power supply for military vehicles to reduce volume and weight, as well as increase efficiency compared to the legacy system. Mainstream proposes a two-stage 2.5 kW power supply with an isolating zero-voltage-switching dual-active-bridge (ZVS DAB) dc-dc front end and an H-bridge inverter back end, both built using high-current GaN devices. The proposed power supply places multiple GaN dies on a Thermal Clad substrate with integrated cooling: reducing the thermal resistance by an order of magnitude over standard PCB based approaches. The power supply has less than 2% THD at the output and has zero-percent de-rating at 71 C ambient temperature. The resulting power supply has a 75% reduction in volume, 42% reduction in weight, and greater than 4% improvement in efficiency compared to the legacy system. At the completion of the Phase I, Mainstreams GaN dual-stage power supply will be a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4."

Passive Q-switching reduces cost, weight, volume, eliminates bulky electro-optical active Q-switches and associated electronics, and simplifies resonator design. Passively Q-switched lasers are compact, ruggedized, reliable, packaged to withstand the shock, vibration, pressure, temperature changes, and have nearly diffraction limited beams. The gain crystal, Q-switch, and resonator mirrors can be integrated onto a monolithic device. High average power (&gt;11 W) passively Q-switched Nd:YVO4 lasers using Cr+4:YAG saturable absorber have been demonstrated but pulse energy and repetition rate were ~ 60 J at 190 kHz because of the fast 4 s lifetime of the saturated transition in Cr+4:YAG. However, both Co:Zn:S, and Co:Zn:Se have saturated transition lifetimes ~ 200 to 300 s at 295 K and lifetimes increase to ~ 600 to 800 s at 250 K. This may permit temperature tuning of repetition rate and open up the possibility to CW pumped, high energy (mJ range), high average power passive Q-switching at sub-kHz repetition rates. Benefits of funding include publishing research and commercial applications such as laser scalpels, LIDAR, and pollution monitoring."

BICS maintains a constant temperature, and has great flexibility for higly variable heat acquisition, through two-phase heat transport. This technology integrates the coldplate into a laminated buswork typical of tightly integrated battery modules. This laminated configuration fully isolates the cooling system from the busbar conductors via a dielectric working fluid and busbar intraplanar electrical insulation. Two-phase heat transport has the benefit of flow rates at least an order of magnitude smaller than single phase, is readily able transport heat from high flux and transient sources, and can maintain a constant temperature at the evaporator (coldplate or heat exchanger), and condenser over a wide range of heat loads. The system posed is highly flexible through the parallel placement of heat acquisition components, and is insensitive to the installed orientation and configuration of the battery hardware. Paragons proposed solution builds upon the significant research and development experience of our Principal Investigator in this field. Phase I modelling and simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed system; while design, build, and demonstration of the BICS validates the concept and its success in this application."

        "abstract": "The lift fan system is an integral part of the hovercraft class of vehicles such as Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC) and is used to pressurize the skirt and discharge air to the thrusters for steering. Although the lift fan impellers can be designed to achieve very high efficiency, the operational efficiency of the system on the boat drops significantly due to installation effects and other flow losses in coupling with the system. In this proposal CRAFT Tech will team up with Curtiss-Wright and design an advanced lift fan to meet the aggressive requirements set forth by the Navy. In doing so, improvements to aerodynamic efficiency and reduction in impeller noise will be weighed against blade installation and manufacturing considerations as well as construction material and coating decisions that influence procurement and service costs. CRAFT Tech will utilize its in-house high-fidelity physics based flow analysis tools to investigate the aerodynamic losses associated with the operation of the SSC lift fan system. Consequently, a formal design optimization study will be employed to improve the impeller blade design and related installation parts."

        "abstract": "Lift fan efficiency, noise, and life cycle cost all impact mission capabilities of the Navys next-generation landing hovercraft, the Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC). Improving efficiency will increase the SSCs endurance and range, reduced noise will improve environmental conditions for personnel on the craft, and minimizing life cycle cost will reduce the overall operational expenses for the SSC program. We propose to develop a high-efficiency, advanced lift fan design using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and structural finite element analysis (FEA) models to maximize efficiency and minimize structural and aeroacoustic noise. We will implement a parametric study to rapidly identify leading designs. We have also teamed with an industry-leading Naval Systems manufacturing partner to evaluate the feasibility and cost of fabricating advanced 3-D blade geometries. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the improved performance and cost effectiveness of our design through numerical modeling, manufacturing studies, and fabrication of prototype hardware. We will use the results to develop a manufacturing plan and a detailed design including the capability to remove and replace individual blades with the impeller installed on the craft."

The proposed effort leverages an innovative yet structured approach to concept development and feasibility study.Each proposed solution will be designed to meet the minimum mission requirements, but the following designs (and others not yet identified) will be considered during Phase I to explore the tradeoffs of capability versus cost, complexity, and crew safety for each design: permanently installed inflatable MBK, deployable rigid or semi-rigid MBK, and a combination of permanent and deployable elements.Outcomes will include a feasible MBK concept design(s), preliminary design and sizing calculations, concept of operations, modeling and simulation results, and manufacturing cost estimates."

        "abstract": "The Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) is limited in at sea vehicle launch and recovery with the as-built stern ramp to operations in Sea State 1. The United State Marine Corps (USMC) has stated that at-sea launch and recovery of the existing AAV, the ACV 1.1, and potential ACV 1.2 from a high speed shallow draft connector are of significant operational importance. To this end, The USMC has advised the Navy that is necessary to develop a light weight modular buoyant kit (MBK) to allow such operations from the existing JHSV stern ramp. This proposal outlines a concept utilizing several buoyancy providing components, constructed of Barry compliant drop stitch material, strategically placed so that they can handle the required 30 short ton vehicle loads for amphibious vehicle launch and recovery in up to Sea State 3 as well as the static ramp weight. Concurrent with the conceptual design of the MBK, the proposal outlines analysis of this preliminary design using Navateks already developed and validated hydro-mechanical modeling tools. Using validated simulation software, the conceptual design(s) will be developed sufficiently to analyze for cost, size, and storability requirements."

In Phase I, we will focus on design optimization through finite-element analysis to meet the specified load and weight requirements. Currently available FI systems will be evaluated based on load rating versus weight for comparison. The best features of each will be combined with the novel load bearing mounting bracket concept into a design that will improve upon the existing systems in four areas critical to Naval ship FI systems including: (1) improved modularity in the rail system and customizable mounting with easily installed cross members to accommodate irregular bolt patterns without adding height to the system, (2) simplified rail cross section for single process manufacturing, (3) weight-specific load bearing mounting brackets that add strength to the support structure as needed further minimizing the weight of the rails, and (4) finite-element optimization of strength to weight ratio."

        "abstract": "The research objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of a reliability-centered AM design framework to mitigate manufacturing defects, predict mechanical properties under a variety of loading conditions and damage scenarios, and perform in-situ inspection of level of performance under operational conditions. The proposed framework will focus on the powder bed process and will account for complex part geometry and small lot size. The mitigation of defects will be performed using existing physics-based simulation models, the predictions of mechanical properties and in-situ inspection will be performed using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. The DIC data will be analyzed for change detection and anomaly flagging using statistical hypothesis testing. Laboratory coupons will be produced in order to perform dimensional\/functional characterization, metallography, elevated temperature mechanical property determination, in-situ health monitoring for a sample load case, and to perform post-test assessment. The design framework will utilize reusable software components connected using a service oriented architecture and driven using a user-customizable control logic."

        "abstract": "The proposal involves study of wafer to wafer, and device to wafer interconnect technologies that can provide &gt; 1M interconnects per wafer (200mm). Silicon wafers with high density routing and high density -- 20 micron and 10 micron diameter-- TSVs (Through Silicon Vias), provide the starting substrate. Thermo-mechanical modeling studies will be done to assess the interconnect structure and interconnect material set. Based on the study and process integration analysis, a test vehicle will be designed. Short loop (no TSVs) and full loop (with TSVs) will be built. Wafer to wafer interconnection processes are evaluated first using short loop wafers followed by full loop wafers. Electrical testing along with X-ray and other monitoring techniques will be used to evaluate the wafer to wafer assemblies. Silicon to Silicon, Silicon to Glass wafer interconnects will be evaluated. Gross reality check reliability testing (100 cycles of thermal cycling) is planned to get a preliminary idea of the robustness of the interconnect. Additionally, we plan to evaluate alternate device material assemblies. After the results are obtained and analyzed, plans for follow up development and commercialization of the technology are proposed."

        "abstract": "There is a longstanding need for a reliable, low-cost manufacturing method for assembling and electrically interconnecting high-density 2.5-dimensional and 3-dimensional multi-wafer stacks, including those composed of dissimilar materials and transistor technologies. However, many of the transistor technologies used in defense electronics are not compatible with the modern, full-wafer back-end-of-line processes used in commercial, largely foreign, semiconductor fabs. Thus, new approaches are required to create custom wafer stacks with a large number of interconnects in the vertical (via) and horizontal (trace) dimensions across an entire wafer and wafer stack.To address this need, inkjet-print (IJP) deposition and patterning of dielectric, electrical, and optical materials will be shown capable of interconnecting a multi-layer wafer stack, with high-density electrical and optical interconnection. In Phase I, the ability to print micron-scale electrical traces and 3D interconnections, and conformal adhesive layers will be demonstrated. Multi-wafer stacks will be fabricated, and electrically and mechanically tested."

Final products will be demonstrated to meet the Navys DC testing requirements, and Novati offers RF testing as further validation of the performance and reliability of the interconnect technology as well as the ability to scale the manufacturing process while retaining the beneficial reduction in SWAP-C at a yield rate of 99% per the Navy guidelines. Test results will also validate that Novatis selected integration techniques do not impede or degrade device performance. Competing 3D processes require large area exclusions that require valuable die area and result in the disruption of the BEOL interconnect stack of at least one IC layer in a 3D IC. DBI allows for direct connections to be made between ICs as part of the bond process without disrupting and compromising the interconnect stack. With DBI, 3D IC cost is minimized by avoiding design exclusions in the interconnect stack and delivering a vertical interconnections between IC layers in a 3D IC that can scale with the process node."

Each detector module would be comprised of a cadmium tungstate linear detector array (LDA) and a Varian PaxScan 1515DXT Digital Image Receptor. The proposed design would couple the bottom face of the LDA to the 1515DXT, which would allow the 1515DXT to be removed from the X-ray fan-beam. The detector components would be incorporated into an existing system that operates in a translate-rotate imaging modality, and the completed system would not necessitate significant reworking of the current image reconstruction algorithm. In this system, the achievable imaging resolution would be dictated by the pitch of the LDA, which in term would be limited by various forms of cross talk and the signal-to-noise ratio. As a baseline, the proposed solution should be able to offer an image resolution of approximately 1.0 mm. A comprehensive Geant4 Monte Carlo mode would be developed to simulate the relevant radiative and optical physics and to allow for efficient optimization of an LDA design capable of achieving sub-millimeter resolution."

        "abstract": "The proposed research offers an innovative approach to distributed maritime target sensing that centers on the development of a new Mid Frequency Active Sonobuoy (MFAS) that combines an efficient coherent source and directional receiver in a single A-size package. Of particular relevance is the challenge of designing a capable MFAS with suitable acoustic receiver aperture, source level, processing, communications, and life in a cost effective package. To meet this challenge, AcornSI has teamed with Sparton Corporation\/ERAPSCO and BAE Systems to provide a best of breed solution that takes maximum advantage of previous Navy investments while simultaneously incorporating breakthroughs in both acoustic sources and sensing. In addition to sonobuoy design, the AcornSI team will also focus on assuring interoperability with legacy Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems and platforms and will develop coordinated multi-platform MFAS based concepts of operations. Key to this interoperability will be incorporation of advanced in-buoy signal processing along with optimal use of limited bandwidth communication links."

        "abstract": "The objective of this SBIR program is to demonstrate a navigation system that can provide continuous position estimate accurate to better than 100 m (with 10 m goal) in GPS-contested environments by augmenting a military GPS receiver with eLoran signals and other small size, weight and power (SWaP) sensors. With eLoran signals being high-powered and transmitted at low-frequency, they are not disrupted by the type of jammers employed to deny GPS and hence can provide an affordable, and reliable backup to GPS.In the Phase I study, Mayflower will develop the APEL system specifications and architecture through simulation modeling and analysis and evaluate its feasibility in providing the required positioning accuracies to the specified platforms. In the follow-on Phase II program, we will perform a detailed design and implementation of the APEL system prototype and demonstrate its performance in relevant GPS degraded scenarios. We anticipate the APEL navigation system to achieve TRL 6 maturity at the completion of the Phase II program.In the follow-on Phase III program, Mayflower will refine the APEL navigation system implementation for performance, robustness, and reliability, and package all the sensors and antennas to meet the SWaP requirements of smaller military platforms."

        "abstract": "GPS performance can be degraded or disabled by radiofrequency (RF) jamming, RF interference, cyberattacks on satellite controls, or attacks on satellites\/ground stations. Given these GPS vulnerabilities, military systems must be Navwar complianti.e., not reliant on a single source of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data. Possible alternative PNT technologies include E-LORAN; improved inertial navigation (NAV); terrain-following, gravimetric, and geomagnetic systems; vision-based NAV; improved celestial NAV; and systems that exploit RF signals of opportunity. However, no current PNT technology provides covert, jam-resistant localization with accuracy comparable to GPS. To enable accurate NAV in contested environments, Charles River Analytics proposes to design and demonstrate a system for Stealthy RF-based Alternative PNT (STRAP). STRAP will meet three requirements. First, STRAP will use an innovative, RF-based localization technology that is covert, jam-resistant, GPS-independent, and as accurate as GPS. Second, STRAP software will intelligently fuse data from multiple sensors and localization sources (based on their real-time availability and accuracy) to generate accurate estimates and ensure adaptable, robust performance under varying conditions. Third, STRAP hardware will be small, lightweight, and low-power to be compatible with platforms such as F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and precision guided munitions (PGMs)."

        "abstract": "The Global Positioning System (GPS), while being highly successful, has created a single point of failure for many military and civilian applications requiring precise time and position. The Long Range Navigation (LORAN) system was a proven and stable navigation aid until it was abandoned because of the success of GPS. Now it is clear that a backup to GPS is required and the enhanced-LORAN (eLORAN) system is being proposed to take over that role. During this Phase I program Toyon proposes to modify an existing auxiliary navigation system design that is currently being developed for the Navy for GPS-denied carrier landing to include the ability to receive and process eLORAN signals as well as other communication signals. The modified receivers developed on this program will be fully compatible with that system. When developed, the system will be able to make use of GPS and other Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, as well as eLORAN, and signals-of-opportunity (SoOp). When GPS is degraded or denied, in addition to eLORAN and SoOp, the receiver will be able to process a novel navigation waveform that will be broadcast from a pseudolite-like reference system that requires only two beacons for a full navigation solution."

        "abstract": "Aerial refueling is a mission-critical component of Navy operations. The refueling portion of a mission is made difficult by the inherent interference between the tanker and receiver aircraft. The receiver aircraft may experience various forms of disturbances while approaching the fuel hose and drogue, stressing the control system of an autonomous vehicle. Current flight simulation capabilities are unable to accurately reproduce the impact of the complex tanker wake on the receiver aircraft. The proposed research program will demonstrate the feasibility of a Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) toolkit that may be incorporated into the CASTLE simulation environment for simulating incremental changes in the forces and moments of the receiver aircraft as it approaches the tanker during typical refueling scenarios. Through the use of high fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) predictions, Response Surface Models will be developed which shall encompass the complex wake effects on the receiver aerodynamic coefficients as a low order polynomial. This approach provides an analytic representation of system behavior that may be quickly interrogated for use in real time flight simulation. The proposed program will examine the use of RSMs for different tanker\/receiver configurations, and explore their applicability to predicting drogue dynamics during receiver approach."

        "abstract": "The ability to refuel piloted aircraft in flight is considered a strategic military asset and has been a critical element of success in nearly every US and NATO military engagement of the jet age. Equally important going forward will be the ability to perform Autonomous Aerial Refueling (AAR) and refuel unmanned aircraft in flight. In order to properly set the requirements for AAR, a high-fidelity aerial refueling simulation is needed to predict performance and refine requirements. Modeling and simulation of aerial refueling provides an invaluable capability in designing and\/or evaluating an AAR system allowing the Navy to accurately assess drogue stabilization, closure rates, turbulence and the bow wave effect, hose reel tension failure implications, and defining and predicting success rates.The proposed solution set forth in this effort involves developing a modified vortex lattice method (VLM) that is customized for calculating the incremental forces and moments on a generic receiver aircraft resulting from a non-uniform flow-field of a tanker aircraft. In the remainder of this proposal, this method is referred to as an incremental vortex lattice method or IVLM."

To enable this capability, modeling and simulation tools that have the ability to be reconfigured to meet UAS design and development needs are required. Bihrle Applied Research Inc proposes the development of the Wake Interaction Determination for Simulation (WInDSim). The WInDSim concept leverages technology from previous SBIR efforts and COTS software, developed by BAR and its consultant, to create a comprehensive tool to model the effects of air wake disturbances on an air vehicle. The WInDSim will be an externally hosted simulation enhancement tool that uses state-of-the-art unsteady CFD-based wake models and advance aerodynamic prediction algorithms to compute wake-induced aerodynamic increments. The proposed Phase I effort examines the feasibility of the WInDSim concept by investigating several wake induced aerodynamic prediction methods and comparing results with measured data collected during previous research. In addition, a demonstration of the WInDSim concept will be performed. With the feasibility of the tool demonstrated, a Phase I optional effort defines software specifications and detailed designs."

        "abstract": "Navy operations in congested littoral areas or when transiting straits is very challenging for force protection because of heavy traffic ranging from small pleasure craft and fishing vessels, to very large cargo ships and barges that are navigating in close proximity. Constructing and maintaining the track picture over long periods of time under these conditions is particularly difficult because there needs to be a methodology employed that uses an accrual of information about the surface contacts to enable high probability of re-association. The use of advanced techniques that exploit high range resolution (HRR) interrogations, EO\/IR imagery and surface vessel electromagnetic emissions (AIS and non-AIS) all play a major role in establishing and maintaining the surface contact picture over large periods of time. However, smaller vessels with very few distinguishing features that irregularly or never emit are particularly challenging. The use of a maritime traffic model to further augment the track picture is potentially high value for improved track performance against small non-emitting surface vessels."

The resulting track quality will support our ongoing work in maritime classification aid (MCA), which is targeted for integration into the Navy Minotaur environment.The RDRTec team proposed M-TMBT system will increase track life expectancy by more than an order of magnitude over the state-of-the-art trackers. Our sensor-agnostic solution will enable highly automated and rapid post-mission analysis in addition to a radical shift toward real-time interdiction of targets in the most complex maritime environments.

        "abstract": "Littoral waterways impose a challenging surveillance requirement for naval forces tasked with protecting its surface assets. To achieve a high-level of situational awareness, it is important to persistently track and characterize the various entities that may pose a threat. However, dense surface traffic results in more frequent data association ambiguity which leads to more tracking errors. Toyon shall research and develop enhanced kinematic prediction techniques to improve persistent tracking performance in littoral waterways. Toyon shall develop an algorithm for estimating maritime traffic flow in the littoral region. The algorithm shall estimate the parameters of the maritime traffic flow model using a variety of a priori and real time data, including observed target trajectories derived from collected surveillance data. To support evaluation of the prediction algorithm, Toyon shall integrate the traffic flow model with its Tracked Object Management (TOM) framework for improving persistent signature-aided tracking of small boats. Toyon proposes to team with Raytheon Company on this effort. Toyon will work with radar experts at Raytheon to produce a high-fidelity simulation model of the AN\/APY-10 radar system within SLAMEM. The simulation model will be used for proof-of-concept demonstration of the enhanced TOM algorithm."

The targeted laser diodes will emit between 330 - 350 nm with an emission power exceeding 1 W. These lasers will find application in remote Raman spectroscopy applications, non-line of sight communication systems, and laser identification and detection systems. We will use n-type GaN substrates in order to achieve the first vertical AlGaN laser diode emitting in the UV. This configuration will enable more homogenous current injection, higher achievable pumping power, better thermal management, and, as a direct consequence, high output power."

The variety of such arrays (dynamically written pixels, prisms, lenses) suggests their high potential to overcome limitations of mechanical and electro-mechanical scanning imaging systems. First, by their nature, liquid crystal based devices are electronically switchable and eliminate any need for mechanical movements, provide such benefits as a fast speed, lightweight, low power consumption, high accuracy, reliability, and insensitivity to vibrations. To their advantage, the mentioned characteristics provided by liquid crystal materials are as a given. Second, specifically to one of the approaches described in this proposal - a sequence of three micro-lens arrays, with one in the middle dynamically shifted with respect to the others, presents a highly promising solution to create large apertures and large sweep angles non-mechanical scanning mirror for an airborne optical sensor. The device promises to provide any pattern of the scans and the correction for aircraft motions, air turbulence, and other disturbing factors. Also, making this technology suitable for fabrication on display production lines will significantly shorten the transition from the research and prototyping to the mass production."

With the goal of delivering a detailed design document for an immersive simulation trainer that allows students to use their own equipment and accommodate a comprehensive range of USN aircraft for both bail-out and ejection seat scenarios, the effort will consider current and upcoming hardware (sensors and displays) and software\/middleware development tools and runtime virtual environment engines in order to provide a design that exploits extensive industry investments in virtual reality and mixed reality technology. Additionally, techniques and technology from the Hollywood stunt community will lend a dimension of realism to the student&apos;s experience to improve learning and slow skill decay. A novel, cloud-based intelligent tutoring system and instructor interface will enable reliable prediction of student skill acquisition and decay for individualized AAR and follow-up."

        "abstract": "Parachute Descent Procedure (PDP) training helps Naval aircrew learn and refresh their skills properly maneuvering a parachute to a safe landing, both over-land and over-water. Currently, aviators train PDPs using the Parachute Descent Virtual Reality Trainer, which is deficient in several key ways including (1) the inability to view the harness and gear while wearing the included head-mounted display, (2) its incompatibility with standard flight equipment, and (3) the low quality of the projected visuals.Desired is a new training solution that takes advantage of new technology. SoarTech envisions a training solution that features (1) a more realistic virtual environment to situate the training, (2) a better means by which to track trainee parachute operation, (3) support for different aircraft, and (4) an embedded means for tracking\/assessing trainee decision making where appropriate. In this proposal, we propose a revamped capability, entitled SkyFall, which exploits both new technology and leverages our significant expertise in gesture and image recognition, simulated training and virtual environments. We propose for Phase I to design, develop and demonstrate a proof-of-concept exemplar in a representative physical setup. SoarTech shall then develop a fully-functional PDP malfunction and decision-making training system by the conclusion of the Phase II effort."

However, the aviators, in most cases, have no parachuting experience prior to emergency egress. To ensure their safety and prepare them for extreme circumstances, they must be trained to handle such situations. Currently, PARASIM, a virtual reality parachute simulator developed by Systems Technology Inc. (STI), provides such training. In this Topic, the Navy has identified enhancements to the current training that include:Seamless interfacing with real flight equipment across all Navy platformsComplete ejection and bailout training from under canopy to landingIntegration of visual environment and physical flight equipmentAfter action review (AAR) to include procedure checklist and cause-effect analysis of the decisions in the descending process.STI proposes to develop an Immersive Parachute Descent Trainer (IPDT), a low-cost, robust solution to address the desired training needs, interfacing with standard flight equipment across all Navy platforms. This concept builds upon STIs parachute simulation expertise and leverages STIs patented Fused Reality technology, combining live real-world video with the virtual environment, and enabling the trainee to wear, see, and interact with standard flight equipment during the real-time, interactive parachute simulation."

To address this need, IAI and our frequent collaborators from the Parks College Parachute Research Group, propose to investigate a Common Parachute Descent Trainer (CoPDeT). CoPDeT will provide a common infrastructure that provides an affordable immersive environment while enabling air crew from different aircraft to practice with the flight suits and ejections seats that they would use in the field within CoPDeT. In our Phase I work, we will investigate an initial proposed solution. The components investigated include (1) the weight-bearing superstructure, (2) connections to individual air crew descent equipment, (3) video presentation of the environment, (4) sensors that collect data about trainee movement, (5) the degree of immersiveness the environment provides, (6) and a computer integration capability that collects data, controls video presentation based in part on trainee activity, and will be used in later phases to assess performance and provide adaptive feedback."

        "abstract": "Fatigue cracks originating at fastener thru-hole locations are a primary damage mode in multi-layered joints. If these cracks remain undetected, a joint failure can follow with potentially catastrophic consequences. In-hole inspection of joints is difficult, costly, and time consuming. A sensor integrated with a fastener capable of detecting cracks in the borehole surfacei.e. a Smart Fastener - would significantly reduce the maintenance burden for aircraft operators. A Smart Fastener is far superior to manual inspection methods for layered joints as it is capable of continuously monitoring a borehole, without disassembly of the structure. The goal of the current program is to fully develop a Smart Fastener for damage detection in multi-layer aircraft structures. Previous work done in this area will be used as a basis for the development. The program will demonstrate the robustness of the enhanced Smart fastener in relevant operational environments and its capability for usage in actual aircraft structures while interfaced with the aircraft onboard HUMS system. The work will be done in close collaboration with Sikorsky Aircraft who is supporting the development. Phase I will demonstrate feasibility of the Smart Fastener in crack initiation detection. Complete fastener development will be done in Phase II."

The principle of this inspection method has a long history as an NDT method, commonly referred to as a coin tap test, however the application of this method has remained relatively primitive and subjective. KCF will advance this tried and tested inspection method with modernized, high-sensitivity vibration and acoustic sensors coupled with a miniature piezo or solenoid impactor and our ultra-high bandwidth wireless data system.

        "abstract": "Rotorcraft have been at the forefront of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) technologies. For nearly 20 years, Heath &amp; Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) have been used on rotorcraft such as the H-60, CH-53E, H-1 and V-22 to collect prognostic data to reduce preventative maintenance costs and increase asset availability. The majority of the HUMS data collected today relates to drive system components, such as monitoring vibration off gears, bearings, shafts and rotors. The vast majority of HUMS were developed by Goodrich (now part of UTAS). The proposed technology would expand HUMS hardware to be able to also capture fatigue damage in complex fastened joints. Many Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems in development can detect damage on flat structure, but features hidden in a multi-layer stack can be extremely challenging for conventional technologies. Multiple approaches for addressing this problem will be investigated in this program, each within the concept of using a distributed beamforming array with the fasteners themselves being the sensor elements. By exciting the fasteners directly, more energy will penetrate into the complex joints, thus making it easier to discover hidden damage. Integration with UTAS HUMS hardware will also be addressed."

        "abstract": "Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are attractive for several light-weight defense and aerospace applications. However, their inherent anisotropy and complex failure mechanisms limit their use in high-performance structures or components. Failure in FRP composites is a multi-scale process due to accumulation of progressive damage events. The failure behavior is also dependent on the nature of loads (impact, fatigue) and the environment. There is a need to develop new analysis tools that can model the multi-scale damage interactions within composite parts.Under this SBIR, ACT proposes to develop a peridynamics (PD) based meshless framework for capture of progressive damage in Fiber-reinforced composites subject to static, dynamic and fatigue loading conditions. To accomplish this ACT will advance a recently developed computational framework (in the realm peridynamics) which can account for both microscale damage and damage evolution in the form of crack growth and failure in composite structures. By virtue of the non-local formulation of peridynamics approach the governing equations are cast in the form of integro-differential equations which can be solved for propagation of cracks and discontinuities, without any need for re-meshing the domain or any additional prescription of crack paths."

        "abstract": "Despite their lightweight and superior performance in service, damage in structural composites involves extremely complicated nonlinear processes acting from the micro-scale (e.g., micro-cracking and crazing), to the structural scale (e.g., large cracks and global buckling). Therefore, high fidelity numerical methods and computer simulation has been extensively used to predict fracture and damage process in composite structures. TDA plans to use advanced finite element methods to determine 3D damage progression in composite structures considering discrete failure modes such as matrix cracking, fiber-matrix shear, fiber breakage, and delamination. Advanced numerical methods and computer simulations are utilized in a virtual test lab capable of capturing the damage initiation and growth. Specifically TDAs focus is on building a virtual multi-scale laboratory which will (a) ease the burden of experiments, (b) provide the evolution of three dimensional crack paths in composite material and (c) predict the failure and damages in fiber reinforced composite materials. The required analytical models are developed in the framework of advanced finite element model. Test-Analysis correlations will be made to improve fidelity of model predictions. Fracture path and life of aerospace structural component under realistic loading scenarios will also be determined."

(GEM) along with its team member Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) propose to develop a multiscale and generalized discrete crack damage prediction toolkit for fiber-reinforced composites subjected to static and cyclic loading. GEM will draw on its extensive experience in composite progressive damage analysis and leverage its current NAVAIR sponsored composite bolted and bonded joints programs and data collected from NGC under their Air Force sponsored Tech Scout 2 program for module enhancement and validation under this Phase I program. In order to capture a curvilinear matrix crack path and its interaction with an intersected delamination crack, a slanted phantom-paired X-FEM approach coupled with a segmented cohesive model will be developed for the kinematic description of crack network without remeshing. The co-existence of both discrete cracking and diffuse damage has motivated us to develop a multi-scale approach based on an N-phase cylinder micromechanics model for extraction of static and fatigue damage accumulation at an integration point of a discrete cracked element. To bridge the gap between stress-life driven crack initiation and Paris type description for crack propagation, a unified fatigue damage prediction model will be implemented to capture the delamination initiation and propagation under fatigue loading."

        "abstract": "The development of new military aircraft with improved stealth, lower ground noise and higher efficiency engine designs is driving increasingly complex inlet geometries. The momentum created by a gas turbine engine is highly dependent on the characteristics of the incoming airflow, necessitating accurate understanding of inlet flow distortion characteristics to ensure proper operation over the entire operational envelope. As such, design engineers must account for possible distortions to that inlet flow when designing and testing prototype aircraft. To assist with current and future engine\/aircraft design and development, new distortion characterization technologies are required. Although characterization of the inlet flow properties can be done during development, these techniques are often invasive. Common techniques for characterization use pitot tubes that can perturb the flow. Furthermore, damage to sensors that protrude into the flow can result in expensive domestic object damage events. More critically, the operability of the engine can be influenced by thermal, pressure, or swirl distortion. Certain combinations of angle of attack and flight speed can lead to surge conditions, potentially causing expensive damage to engines. Prime Photonics proposes to work with the TurboLab of Virginia Tech to develop a robust, minimally invasive, flight-ready inlet distortion characterization system."

The Sc-3VC-PPR-LDV\/CompLDV will provide much quantitative low uncertainty information on the mean flow distortion, the flow angles throughout the flowfield, flow unsteadiness amplitudes and frequencies, and the spatial length sizes or scales for the various frequency fluid motions for in-service aircraft engines. Much data can be processed during real-time and provide inflow distortion information during the test so test engineers can modify or vary the inflow conditions to observe flow sensitivities.

Graphene possesses ultra-high mechanical strength and high electrical conductivity, thereby limiting the anode expansion during charging and also improving the utilization of the semi-conductive silicon material. To address the key issue inhibiting commercialization, the extremely high cost of nano-Si, Nanotek has proceeded to develop a highly scalable process to produce Si nanowires directly from low-cost, micron-scaled Si particles (currently $3-$7\/kg). This surprisingly simple and effective technology is expected to enable the availability of Si nanowires at a cost less than $15\/kg, which is close to the commercial graphite material ($10-$20\/kg) but with much higher specific capacity (over 2,000 mAh\/g). Nanoteks non-flammable electrolyte technology including solvent-in-salt design and ionic liquids will be evaluated to guarantee the safety of the batteries equipped on aircrafts or electric vehicles. Several goals are expected by the completion of Phase I: (a) demonstration of a low cost (&lt; $20\/kg), high-energy graphene-silicon nanocomposite anode; (b) further verification and validation of the prototype cell performance, delivering specific anode capacity of 600-2,000 mAh\/g with a cycle life of &gt; 500 cycles and passing preliminary safety specifications."

The process is scalable and uses low-cost reactants and precursors. The ceramic both extends cycle life and enhances safety. The primary customer will be defense and civilian aircraft in which there is a premium value on battery weight, safety and total cost of ownership. Early adopters will include soldier portable, small unmanned aerial systems and consumer electronics manufacturers who put a premium value on weight or run-time and will accept modest cycle life."

Image-based guidance systems are often more precise and robust than laser-guided or GPS systems which can be easily jammed or disabled. However, the performance of image-guided systems relies on the correspondence between a reference image collected during the planning stage and images collected by an on-board imaging sensor. The Navy therefore requires a robust image correspondence method to attain the necessary precision and accuracy for mission success. A Figure of Merit (FOM) will be developed through statistical analysis to provide a quantitative assessment during mission planning stages, predicting how effectively the weapon will acquire and be guided to a target with its image-based system. Aret Associates proposed FOM will assess cross-modal (EO\/IR) correspondence for day-night capability, determining if the correspondence achieves the necessary high degree of confidence."

        "abstract": "Abstract: Naval aviation depends on catapults to enable aircraft to operate safely on aircraft carriers. An important subsystem of the aircraft launch is the Digital End Speed Indicator (DESI). The DESI uses reluctance sensors mounted towards the forward end of the steam catapult to determine the launch speed of aircraft. The current DESI system electronics aboard carriers is experiencing numerous failures due to the shock, vibration, and temperature extremes of the Steam Catapult Central Charging Panel space where the system resides. The Navy needs development of technology to enable electronics to operate in this environment without failure. Our proposed solution will result in capturing the catapult shuttle end speed using innovative indirect measurement techniques and state of the art processing and storing electronics. We will establish a requirements document and a trade study that will result in the simplest, most cost effective, and Aircraft End Speed Indicator (AESI) system that is free from the burden of degradation and erroneous data; analysis that addresses all of the significant issues including ease of retrofit into the available spaces; a summary report; and cost estimates."

As one example subsystem, Digital End Speed Indicators (DESI) use reluctance sensors mounted within the catapult trough to determine aircraft end-speed during launch. The DESI was developed in the 1980s, and recent reliability problems have highlighted the need for modernization and robustness improvements. Creare proposes to develop an Aircraft End Speed Indicator (AESI) system that utilizes modern components and a design hardened against temperature and vibration extremes to achieve these goals. During Phase I, we will develop a conceptual design and demonstrate key aspects with targeted laboratory evaluations. Phase I testing will help identify issues with possible approaches and synthesize solutions to address these issues. While Phase I is intended to select the optimal approach, Phase II will include detailed development of a prototype that can be tested either on a relevant land-based test bed or an aircraft carrier."

Mission planning will be based upon state-of-the art physics algorithms for handling passive and active acoustic Anti-Submarine Warfare as well as high-frequency acoustic and RF comms. Non-linear optimization approaches to efficiently determining the best lay-down and CONOPS will be developed, as well as a 3D visualization capabilities permitting viewing of airborne assets, comms links, undersea acoustic COMMS, ASW performance and environmental variability. The successful development of an undersea vehicle mission planning and visualization system will have commercial applications in the transportation sector (harbor\/airport management) as well as oil exploration."

        "abstract": "Individual undersea warfare (USW) assets have a wide variety of sensors at their disposal (passive acoustic, active acoustic monostatic, active acoustic bi-static, electronic support measures, electro-optical\/infrared, etc.). Many of these assets and sensors tend to have separate standalone mission planning systems or applications that include differing displays of capability and\/or estimated performance, and may be subject to environments that are variable both in space and in time. This ultimately increases the physical and cognitive burden on operators to consolidate and interpret multiple mission planning displays and information to understand the tactical situation. Sensor performance predictions need to be updated routinely due to dynamic oceanographic and atmospheric changes, which also increases operator workload with multiple systems requiring the same information. Adaptive Methods proposes the Collaborative Optimization\/Mission Planning\/Assessment of Sensors Software (COMPASS) that can address these issues by providing a visualization framework to: integrate mission planning tools and tactical decision aids; aggregate data from multiple sources; and allow sensor performance predictions to be composited and easily manipulated using 3D rendering and touch-enabled interfaces. Existing mission planning capability will be incorporated along with multi-objective optimization functions to aid in indicating the performance of individual and groups of manned and unmanned assets and sensors."

We will design a cross-platform software development suite for the EKB that provides 60-80% reusable code for all Apps in a framework designed to support all mobile operating systems APIs for any future EKBs, should the Navy decide to change or use different hardware devices in the future. This cross-platform software development suite will include tools to conduct automatic testing\/evaluation of the Apps developed in the environment against a common GUI design criteria which ranks critical human-machine interfacing, cognitive capabilities, and situational awareness factors. This Phase I effort includes the characterization of these critical human interface design factors and a proof-of-concept demonstration of the App development environment for an iOS based hardware device, using one or two representative App requirements. All Phase I work will serve as the foundation and blueprint for the Phase II prototype system."

Big Nerd Ranch&apos;s research efforts will focus on usability and extensibility. We aim to explore every aspect of an F18 Pilot&apos;s use of the paper kneeboard, its current limitations and shortfalls, and how the processing power of software can improve the usefulness and effectiveness of the traditional kneeboard. Calculations, commonly used charts, and even civilian airports based on geographic location can all benefit by being presented to the pilot when needed. Using device sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, and GPS functions) we can interpret data and present the pilot with relevant information quickly and accurately. Beyond usability and reducing the number of manual processes pilots would need to engage, our research efforts will focus on designing a platform that can be easily modified for other aircraft and potentially related service applications. Successfully doing so not only increases the benefit to the navy and other armed services, but also provides more options of commercialization."

Built from the ground-up to address the human factors issues that pilots face in the flight environment, PATELLA consists of a data-sharing system and accompanying software design specification that will overcome limitations in current electronic kneeboard technologies through two key innovations. First, PATELLA follows a cognitively-inspired design process for EKB apps. This process lays out requirements for advanced software widgets that suit the workflow of F\/A-18 pilots. Second, PATELLAs centralized data-sharing systemwhich is a locally-executing, standalone tablet applicationwill allow PATELLA-compliant apps to share information. This allows PATELLA apps to request user-provided information from other apps in order to provide intelligent defaults to the pilot and reduce the number of interactions needed. With these two innovations, PATELLA will provide the Navy with a powerful, unified design for implementing intelligent apps on the EKB. This enables PATELLA to reduce the pilots interaction time with EKB apps, which in turn decreases the loss of situational awareness that accompanies the heads-down use of current EKB solutions."

This creates issues for the pilot by occupying physical space in the cockpit and forcing them to use multiple sources to complete their duties. By developing an electronic kneeboard application suite for the iPad, we will remove this reliance on hard-copy materials and third-party software and improve situational awareness in-flight by moving this information into a single location. Phase I aims to lay the foundation by first understanding the pilots role through user interviews and the creation of a Goal-Driven Task Analysis. This will be used to guide the design and development of an assigned example application to help pilots calculate brake temperature, along with an initial design concept for the application suite and a software development framework to be developed in future phases. This framework will serve as an open-source tool that third-party development teams can use to improve upon and build new products for the application suitedriving business for us as the product manager, and helping to further position our company as experts in the field of situational awareness technology."

        "abstract": "More efficient on-aircraft repair processes are needed for structural organic-matrix composite components. In response to this need, TRI\/Austin is developing UV curable matrix resins that provide elevated Tg, and high fiber strength translation. The matrix resin will be formulated to achieve glass transition temperatures of &gt; 330F, to restore structural capabilities of damaged aircraft components. The developed resin will be designed to provide quality repairs with minimal support equipment. The less labor intensive process will reduce costs currently associated with composite repairs. Resin rheology and cure kinetics will be determined, and carbon fiber laminates will be fabricated to confirm composite mechanical properties. Composite panels will be produced and tested to verify that the process can produce parts having less than 4% porosity. The objective of reducing the total time for repair will also be addressed. Resin cost analysis and estimates for continued raw material availability will also be established. TRI\/Austin brings experience in the field of UV curable composite development and testing. The development team also includes a company that has thirty years of experience in the area of composite repair technologies and a major helicopter manufacturer."

        "abstract": "Organic-matrix composites are increasingly replacing traditional metallic materials in aerospace platforms due to their high strength to weight ratios, manipulative properties, and corrosion resistance. However, repair methods for these materials are considerably more complicated. Typically, a composite laminate repair patch must be manually fabricated on-site from dry fabric and resin and then bonded to the damaged structure. Prior to the bonding or co-curing, a Double Vacuum Debulk (DVD) process is performed on the lay-up, requiring a separate piece of support equipment. The procedure requires dedicated equipment and is time consuming, costly, and size limited. In addition, the repaired structure is not brought back to full strength. A more efficient and effective on-aircraft process is required. To meet the Navys needs, Luna will develop a single vacuum bag process utilizing advanced bagging materials which will achieve high quality aerospace laminates while eliminating the DVD process tooling and size restrictions. Furthermore, Luna will offer enhanced versions of the standard resins and adhesives to enable cure on-demand systems for quick repairs that can be readily accomplished on-site. Luna will consult with Bell Helicopter to ensure that the technology is relevant to aerospace systems."

MSC will leverage their experience in establishing OoA material processing standards for large-scale marine structures as well as their comprehensive composite damage\/repair knowledgebase, to evaluate material systems and establish processing procedures that lay the foundation for the development of shelf-stable, high-performance repair kits which may ultimately be distributed and utilized throughout the Fleet."

We have performed an initial demonstration of our algorithm against inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images of maritime targets and showed over two orders of magnitude improvement in processing requirements and reduction in Pfc while maintaining comparable Pcc to state-of-the-art ATR algorithms. Our integrated approach will enable fast generation of target signatures for rapid training of new targets while exploiting the physics of radar scattering within a Bayesian compressive manifold learning ATR approach to dramatically improve rejection of non-targets (i.e., false targets and decoys) and classification of high-valued targets of interest in real-time on size weight and power (SWaP) constrained platforms."

However, reliance on just positional information limits the capability of the classifier to distinguish between similar vessels. EMSI proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of significantly improving vessel classification on legacy maritime radar systems, by applying Deep Learning networks to extract physical features from complex SAR, ISAR, and HRR data.

As such shock induces high amplitude and high frequency displacements, Tanner is proposing to mechanically attenuate a baseline 6th Gen. ESAD by decoupling the electronics from the external package. As the existing design is firmly encapsulated within a rigid, 1-inch diameter metallic through-bulkhead initiator (TBI) structure, there is significant room for additional damping and attenuation components to be judiciously added.

Specifically, the innovation in adapting the display interface with decision aids will enable the operator to seamlessly interact with the unmanned aircraft when collision-avoidance maneuvers need to be executed even in the presence of link latency. As a result, this technology offers the pilot capability to achieve human-in-the-loop (HITL) control efficiently and effectively, directly addressing the Navy requirements. In Phase I, POC will develop the ACARI covering all autonomous versus human-initiated controls. We will validate the design with subject-matter-expert (SME) pilots and with industry SMEs. POC will translate the design into software algorithms for laboratory simulation, and will develop detect-and-avoid maneuver displays that show the encounter in order to determine the most efficient way to display recommendations, maneuver decisions, and alerts. In Phase II, POC will prepare design documentation (functional requirements and interfaces) and develop prototype software for HITL testing."

        "abstract": "Autonomous Detect and Avoid (DAA) is vital for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) to be adopted large scale in military and commercial operations. Just as manned aircraft have traffic control and rules followed by pilots, UAS have to follow rules and take guidance. Both sensor input to the human, and control input from the human have inherent communication delay. A holistic DAA capability needs to incorporate human initiated goals with the DAA algorithms. This integration has to keep in mind human factor such as cognitive-load, autonomy reliability, and mission efficiency. The design of the proposed system incorporates exhaustive interaction modalities between the on-board and remote DAA algorithms and the human-in-the-loop. The HCI design will be able to incorporate multiple UAS. The system will provide efficient control for self-separation, as well as collision avoidance. The UI display and controls will be built after empirical human factor design. The system will incorporate DAA algorithms available at UtopiaCompression but will be able to integrate other DAA algorithms as well. The proposed system will address a significant need for reliable collaboration with DAA algorithms by the remote human operator paving the way for UAS operation in a crowded airspace."

        "abstract": "In the evolution of Detect And Avoid (DAA) technologies, no mechanism currently exists to enable a human pilot to specify the mix of human-initiated inputs and autonomous maneuver to maintain safe separation. Bihrle Applied Research Inc. (BAR) proposes to address this technology gap by developing a Human Computer Interface (HCI) that effectively conveys current and impending autonomous maneuvering information that enables the human pilot to effectively determine the appropriate mix of autonomous versus human-initiated inputs necessary to avoid collisions. BARs innovative solution provides the human operator with a timeline-based display and control that provides critical information in an intuitive design that enables effective decision-making given an encounter threat. The design will provide user-configurable settings to accommodate different operating environment, algorithm capabilities, mission intent, pilot preferences, and potential future DAA designs. This unique display will cover the entire encounter timeline from initial detection, through the avoidance maneuver, clear of conflict and the subsequent return-to-course. BAR is uniquely qualified to accomplish this due to its extensive experience in the development of DAA algorithms, User Interface displays for UAS applications, and its comprehensive knowledge of the systems, constraints and operational rule sets stemming from deep involvement in DAA subcommittes and advisory groups."

Large vibrations can loosen fasteners, cause fatigue failures, increase fatigue on people, and cause auditory discomfort. The reduction of these vibrations is beneficial to the aircraft and occupants. Typical passive vibration reduction systems are limited in bandwidth (such as TVAs), very temperature sensitive (such as TMDs), or susceptible to nonlinear behavior when over excited (TVAs and TMDs).  Mid proposes a next generation vibration damping system that utilizes smart materials. The system is scalable to a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes. It is self-tuning, passive, and adaptive. The system is able to respond to changes in vibration frequency by changing its stiffness and changes in vibration amplitude by limiting amplitude of the damper based on the phase of the excitation frequency. These next generation dampers will have a wider bandwidth and higher damping than legacy dampers while remaining easy to install and free of operator intervention."

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, considerable research efforts using Active and Passive techniques have been directed towards understanding and mitigating the propeller aircraft interior noise problem. Active techniques, especially those employing piezoelectric materials have proved to be very effective because of low weight and ease of integration, while passive techniques are pursued because of their simplicity and their adaptability. However, these techniques have only been explored at the fundamental level; but their structural integration with aircraft platforms have not been addressed to date.In this effort, TDA has teamed up with Professor Massimo Ruzzene, Director of the Vibration and Wave Propagation Laboratory at Georgia Tech, to develop a passive Tunable Vibration Absorber (TVA) where mechanically resonating elements and piezoelectric shunts are integrated to the load-carrying structural components to attenuate noise and vibrations over a desired broad range of frequencies, while avoiding performance reductions at high amplitudes. Both piezoelectric shunts and internally resonating mechanisms have shown great potentials for providing materials and structures with unusual mechanical properties and superior dynamic performance. This computational and experimental effort will build upon existing configurations, to develop a noise and vibration attenuation technology that will be effective, durable and applicable to both new and legacy aircraft."

        "abstract": "Current and emerging Navy turboprop aircraft experience high vibration and noise levels in crew spaces resulting in crew fatigue and reduced work effectiveness. Tuned vibration absorbers (TVAs) are ideally suited for the suppression of unwanted noise and vibration, however, current TVAs only function well at a very narrow band of frequencies and under large amplitude excitations can lead to the mass reaching the travel limits of the device. One method to avoid this issue is with the use of a tuned mass damper (TMD), however TMDs are typically made using viscoelastic materials whose material properties are highly dependent on their operating temperature and thus can lose their tuning in uncertain environments. An alternative damping technique is the use of eddy current dampers, which are non-contact, have no volatile liquids or seals and are nearly insensitive to operating temperature. The proposed research effort would develop variable amplitude TVAs that incorporate tunable eddy current dampers and would provide the DoD with a new technology for the suppression of vibration in turboprop aircraft as well as structures subject to variable environmental conditions and where the dynamic amplitude can be uncertain and extreme."

        "abstract": "XL Scientific proposes to develop a high-performance computational electromagnetic (CEM) simulation software for use in modeling shaped radomes and embedded frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) on large-scale platforms. Large and complex antennas are commonly used in airborne platforms to transmit and receive signals. Radomes found on airborne platforms often have streamlined shapes to reduce aerodynamic drag. A typical radome is constructed with multiple layers of dielectric materials with or without embedding FSSs. The electromagnetic characteristics of an ideal radome are similar to a band-pass or a band-stop digital filter: it is opaque to hostile signals, but is transparent to friendly ones. Optimizing the radome shape and embedding FFSs can reflect and attenuate unwanted signals, and pass desired signals with less attenuation.The proposed software will use a hybrid simulation approach to characterize an arbitrary shaped radome and simulate multiple antenna interactions on large-scale platforms. The approach is to combine an exact-physics multi-region multi-solver domain decomposition method (MR-MS-DDM) with an asymptotic ray-tracing method. Our approach provides considerable cost savings over measurement-based antenna characterization, as well as time savings, potentially accelerating system development schedules during the design phase."

        "abstract": "The problem of accurately predicting the performance of a complex antenna system with a variable-thickness, frequency selective surface radome mounted on an aircraft is a difficult one both theoretically and numerically. The complexity of the antenna system calls for use of a full-wave numerical solver, while the large electrical size of the aircraft calls for use of a high-frequency method. Remcom proposes an innovative solution that combines Remcoms full-wave solver for the antenna system, XFdtd, with Remcoms high-frequency solver for the aircraft surface, XGtd. The coupling between the two solvers will be provided by two innovative interfaces to XFdtd, one for incoming electromagnetic waves and one for outgoing waves. This solution is able to handle the full complexity of the structures and surfaces in the near vicinity of the antenna, while being scalable to electrically large structures. Because XFdtd and XGtd are proven commercial products with established user communities, commercialization of the proposed hybrid combination will satisfy the needs of existing customers for a practical solution for the analysis of antenna systems mounted on electrically large platforms, as well as open new opportunities in the defense, automotive, and telecommunication industries."

        "abstract": "Imagine a new ship-to-shore fluid transfer system that takes advantage of the small size and fast-deploying features of the Navys Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS), and which adds the operational longevity and security features of a submarine ship-to-shore pipeline. Global Aerospace Corporation, in collaboration with their research partners, proposes to develop a sinking hose system to provide this enhanced capability for the Navys Logistics Over-The-Shore (LOTS) liquid cargo operations. The system will sink when filled with working fluid. The hose system will possess the necessary density for stable operation on the seafloor, up to sea state 4. The new submersible hose system will significantly extend service life and operational availability, enabling cost savings and reduced waste, while also maintaining the expeditionary nature and rapid deployment of ABLTS. From the Navys perspective, our concept looks and behaves like a heavier ABLTS which sinks upon deployment. The floating nature of the current ABLTS greatly reduces its service life and exposes the hose to weather, UV, collision, and sabotage risks. To overcome these weaknesses, our concept will quickly adapt the Navys ABLTS designs for submarine operation."

        "abstract": "Transferring hydrocarbon fuels and water from ship to shore is a common and vital expeditionary operation performed using long, reinforced hoses known as Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS) hoses. ABLTS hoses float on water. By remaining exposed to the ambient environment without specific protection, the hoses can easily be damaged, whether by surface craft, sea motion, adverse weather or saboteurs. As a result, NAVFAC desires a sinking ABLTS hose to mitigate these issues. ADA Technologies has partnered with Angus Fire, Appleton Marine and Hose Solutions to design and build an initial prototype for a sinking hose, called the HD-HUBLIT. This prototype will be short (3 ft long) but in all other respects representative of the envisioned product. Efforts in Phase I will emphasize buoyancy modeling of the hose before fabrication of small square wall coupons. This coupon fabrication will lead to the selection of the design and materials for the HD-HUBLIT prototype. The prototype may be a single or double jacket hose. It will be tested in a water tank for negative buoyancy and its flexibility will be evaluated. This data will support and demonstrate the viability of the hose designed at that point."

While cable systems employing high temperature superconductors (HTS) have the potential to meet this need, further development work is required to improve the performance and increase the technology readiness level of key system components. The proposed work focuses on developing miniature vacuum pumps that will be used to autonomously maintain the high-vacuum spaces in cryogenic HTS components. Currently, periodic manual intervention is employed to maintain HTS vacuum spaces. This process is capital and labor intensive, which leads to very high operational costs. Creare plans to develop a miniaturized, autonomous, and rugged vacuum system that can be integrated with existing and future HTS components. In Phase I, we will complete a proof-of-concept demonstration of our system. In Phase II, we will develop and test a prototype system."

        "abstract": "The US Navy has identified an autonomous vacuum system as a key component to eliminate maintenance of current shipboard vacuum insulation systems. Currently, maintenance costs around $550,000, with an integrated autonomous vacuum system, this cost can be avoided.Vacuum system of this nature already exist, leak detectors and mass-spectrometers utilize a positive displace roughing pump in conjunction with a turbomolecular pump. The problem is these systems are large, have high power consumptions and are expensive. To solve this, miniaturization would be a natural approach as current systems are designed to pump much larger volumes. However, performance of scroll vacuum pump technology does not always scale linearly with size. And in the case of scroll pumps, miniaturization will reduce the performance bellow the required vacuum levels of this application. This can be solved by the addition of a second stage to the scroll roughing pump. Air Squareds patented 2-stage scroll pump allows miniaturization of positive displacement scroll pumping technology without degradation in vacuum performance. This poses an opportunity for Air Squared to leverage its 2-stage scroll vacuum pump technology, in conjunction with current off the shelf miniature turbo-molecular pump technology to save the Navy hundreds of thousands per year."

These cryogenic atmospheres are maintained using vacuum insulated components to restrict convection, conduction, and radiation heat transfer. Over time, materials under vacuum outgass minute amounts of gases that increase the pressure and convection heat transfer. Getter materials (i.e. activated carbon) are materials that adsorb gases onto their surface from atmospheres down to high vacuum. Certain getter materials experience an irreversible chemical reaction with the molecules limiting their useful life while others are able to be regenerated through reversing the adsorption reaction. This proposal addresses the latter. The Advanced Regenerative Getter (ARG) utilizes a regenerative getter material to reduce vacuum pressures from 0.1 torr to 10-6 torr. The ARG is regenerated by a cartridge heater that increases the temperature of the getter to the point where the adsorbed molecules are outgassed to pressures above atmospheric pressure and expelled from the ARG."

        "abstract": "Sonalysts proposes to develop a novel Digital Early Warning Receiver (DEWR) concept that fits within the digital architecture of the Next Generation Architecture (NGA) Submarine Electronic Warfare Suite. The DEWR will employ a modular video detection and digitization layer with narrow acceptance bandwidths across the entire electromagnetic spectrum and high-speed analog-to-digital conversion. Digital video output is processed to satisfy legacy safety of ship requirements and to feed innovative algorithms for improved pulse characterization, feature extraction, and cueing of the AN\/BLQ-10B narrow band receivers. Raw digital data and Pulse Descriptor Words (PDWs) are provided to a high-speed network to support the incorporation of new capabilities via advanced algorithms. Sonalysts DEWR approach exploits advances in envelope detection technologies to increase sensitivity and dynamic range while retaining the dependability and fleet familiarity required of a safety critical application. A tunable notch filter upstream of the detector is used to mitigate the effects of Continuous Wave (CW) interferers. Additional advantages include: retention of rugged highly reliable analog front end, incremental fielding of digital capability, and supports future NGA system feeding digital data products to and from the DEWR. Sonalysts modular design concept reduces implementation risk for NGA and increases the Navys return on investment."

The reconfigurable microwave filters will allow the sensitive receiver to operate in the presence of large signals while maintaining the sensitivity required for small signal reception and identification. The wideband receiver will be capable of commanding a set-on receiver with increased dynamic range to simultaneously sense and identify large and small signals in and instantaneous bandwidth up to 1 GHz. The wideband receiver and re-configurable filter bank will operate in the 0.25 to 40 GHz microwave and millimeter wave region. Additionally, the pulse descriptive word output of the radar waning receiver will be made available to other systems via a high speed Gigabit Ethernet connection."

        "abstract": "Future power systems on Navy ships require electrical power in the order of 20-80 MW, which currently cant be provided by conventional copper or aluminum power cables. Advanced Conductor Technologies LLC (ACT) has been developing high-temperature superconducting Conductor on Round Core (CORC) power transmission cables, rated at 10 kA per phase, for the Navy that form a potential solution in which the required power can be transported in a lightweight and low-loss system. A benefit of HTS power cables is that they could limit the current to a maximum value and would protect all electrical equipment against overcurrent, which significantly reduces the requirements of these devices. Advanced Conductor Technologies (ACT), together with the Center for Advanced Power Systems (CAPS) propose to develop fault current limiting (FCL) CORC cables for use in naval power transmission systems. We will determine methods to incorporate a high-resistance shunt needed to limit the current during a fault within the CORC cable. Several FCL CORC cables will be tested to verify their current limiting capabilities and to verify if they could be operated in cryogenic helium gas. Well develop methods to mitigate asphyxiation hazards associated with liquid nitrogen if helium gas operation is deemed unfeasible."

        "abstract": "Todays Navy continues to see increased demand for more power both on and off the ship. This need is largely driven by the continued development of high power density advanced weapons systems and sensors. Continued space and weight limitations for these ship applications will drive the need for new power solutions to be light and compact, easing installation on new ships and enabling upgrades on existing ones.  Increased power generation and distribution will also result in the potential for increased fault currents. The proper and safe management of fault currents will be a necessary aspect of the ships electrical grid design. Like the power distribution solutions themselves, fault current limiting (FCL) devices will need to be lightweight, compact and straightforward to implement into the ships electrical network. Superconducting power cables are the ideal solution for large current DC power transmission. Additionally, Superconductors inherently limit currents in excess of their critical current without the complexities and time delay of detection. AMSC has exploited this characteristic to create HTS FCL cables for land based applications. This effort focuses on the application of land based HTS FCL power cable designs to the unique challenges presented by implementation on a US Navy combatant."

The small volume of liquid nitrogen contained in this unit (approximately 8 liters) minimizes the asphyxiation hazard associated with a liquid nitrogen release. Liquid nitrogen allows for a high speed breaker due to its superior dielectric properties compared to conventional dielectrics; as well as reduction or even elimination of resistive losses in the breaker due to operating at cryogenic temperatures. This reduces the size and mass of the moving contacts thus allowing for faster operating speed with a given actuation force."

Aret Associates and Engenium Technologies Corporation (ETC) have partnered for several years to develop the Expendable Data EXfiltration (EDEX) family of devices which can serve multiple roles in both primary and secondary fleet communications schemes. In response to challenges put forth in SBIR solicitation N161-027 (Shallow Water Communications for Mine Warfare), Aret Associates will team with ETC to submit a proposal entitled Near Surface Tethered Data Exfiltration: NST-DEX that solves the stated design challenges. This proposal recommends doing research and development to modify EDEX technology to create a tethered, minimal surface presence communications unit which interfaces directly to emplaced mines. This variant will enable a two-way communications gateway through the air\/sea interface and return communications back to the mine platform. The development of this new modality will expand the possible CONOP scenarios beyond the limitations of the current EDEX devices."

        "abstract": "Acoustic communication near shorelines is frequently problematic because of high ambient noise and poor propagation conditions. AD&amp;D is proposing a low-cost, lightweight, Magneto-Inductive Modem which will provide reliable short range communications to ranges of 1000 meters near a shoreline in a secure manner.Exponential absorption loss in seawater is fierce, over 0.8 dB per meter at 575 Hz with 4 S\/m conductivity, precluding a direct path through the water at anywhere near the required maximum range. Our approach makes use of either up-over-down or down-over-up propagation paths, which takes advantage of negligible absorption loss in the air or potentially much lower absorption loss in the ocean floor to allow communications at a range of 1000 meters.During this effort, AD&amp;D will demonstrate geometries that maximize MI communication ranges and will demonstrate a low cost loop antenna sensitive to only low frequency H-fields, a low cost, efficient power amplifier with integrated waveform generation capability, and a low-noise preamp-digitizer which will be used to collect data for analysis. Proof-of-Concept demonstrations will be performed to show that the hardware is effective and the concepts are sound. Collected data will be analyzed to demonstrate antenna performance, transmitter radiation efficiency, and the receiver noise floor."

Separate control channels allow for high reliability to be achieved and ongoing performance monitoring and fault localization to be aggregated. The DWDM approach to increasing optical fiber capacity has been industry standard in the telecommunications industry since the early 2000s. Numerous commercial implementations exist that can combing hundreds of independent optical channels. SBMs approach includes electrical to optical conversion and optical multiplexing to create a multiprotocol solution within a DWDM architecture similar to telecommunications standards. Additional redundancy and performance monitoring creates a robust and flexible solution allowing for significant performance improvements without substantial reconfiguration and infrastructure changes to existing cable plants."

The primary objective of Phase I is to investigate the feasibility of developing fully functional, drop-in replacement battery modules for the SWSS array. These systems are anticipated to operate seamlessly with existing SWSS designs but provide multiples times more energy while being safer and easier to handle. A Phase II effort would involve developing and testing both bench-top and in-water prototypes. Open Water&apos;s Al-H2O system leverages the base-mediated oxidation of a depassivated, corrosion-resistant alloy (e.g. Al99.76Ga.12In.14), with seawater taken from the ocean environment serving as an oxidizer. This chemistry has been demonstrated in a 30W power stack with direct-seawater injection and a passive Al(OH)3 flush. To date, an energy density superior to that of lithium-thionyl chloride cells has been demonstrated by Open Waters architecture on a cell level."

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a compact, hybrid, self-contained, quiet, and safe power source for the Shallow Water Surveillance System consisting of an integrated power source for rechargeable batteries, which will be kept fully charged or recharged with energy from a beta particle source. RMD is pioneering a new concept in betabatteries based on incorporating long life beta emitting isotopes directly into a high-brightness scintillator. Betabatteries provide an extremely high energy density, which can provide a long term stable and reliable source of power, without a need for either refueling or exposure to sun, wind, waves, or other environmental source. The proposed technology uses a self-irradiated scintillator and a photodiode which converts the light into electric power. In this effort we will develop CsI scintillator doped with radioactive thallium-204, which is a pure beta source with 3.7 years half-life. This technology will enable a compact, portable power supply station for recharging electronic devices. A system weighing less than 80 pounds would provide up to 10 watts for up to 3 years. It can also be used as an integrated hybrid lithium\/betabattery device to increase the useful life of a rechargeable battery from a period of months to years."

        "abstract": "U.S. Naval operations, like other U.S. military operations, have come to depend more and more on manned and unmanned vehicles to carry out missions, including missions such as ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare, inspection\/identification, oceanography, communication, payload delivery, information operations and time critical strikes. These mission capabilities are essential to help our naval forces maintain maritime superiority around the world. However, in the case of submersibles (such as Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDS wet), Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS dry), future Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS wet) and Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS)), the operation duration and transit distance are often limited by the energy storage capacity of their power systems. Current technologies used by the military for high energy density applications such as submersibles include Li primary batteries (e.g. LiSOCl2 ~500WH\/kg, or Li-CFx-MnO2), Silver Zinc batteries (140-200 WH\/kg), and Li-ion secondary batteries (180-220 WH\/kg). However, these three battery chemistries do not fully meet operational requirements and have relatively high costs.In this SBIR program, a novel high energy density seawater battery is proposed and will be developed to meet this urgent demand from the U.S. Navy."

        "abstract": "A critical element in higher power systems such as T\/R modules, communication transmitters, and EW modules, is power combiners. To obtain the necessary output power, systems typically require multiple combined power amplifiers. Various options are available, however, the trade-offs between options must be fully understood. Couplers based on planar structures or 2.5 dimensional designs are readily available either as custom designed circuits within the substrate, or as components. Another option depending upon the frequency band of operation, are waveguide or spatial based combiners. Trade-offs that must be taken into account include size, weight, insertion loss, bandwidth, power handling capacity, and size. There is a tremendous need for the development of low loss, small form factor, low cost, higher power combiners that can be integrated into a systems substrate or procured as a component. Omega Micro Technologies will leverage their expertise in the field of RF and microwave substrate design and fabrication to produce an innovative, high power combiner technology integrated into a low-temperature co-fired ceramic substrate yielding an optimum balance of design parameters. Multiple coupler topologies will be developed such that a broad range of frequencies, bandwidths, and output power can be supported."

We will streamline our exclusive PolyStrata microfabrication process to batch-manufacture affordable 3D couplers using plated copper on low cost substrates. Couplers developed during this program will be fully compatible with automated module assembly, require no critical wire-bond geometries, and be held to micron tolerances that will improve repeatability. Next generation radar and EW systems will benefit from this technology by enabling more affordable and efficient solutions. Data from test articles in the Phase I study will be compared to benchmarks set by couplers used by our transition partner to underscore improved performance parameters and prepare our path toward point solutions in Phase II, enabling rapid transition to programs of record."

However, in the past many wireless solutions proposed for ship board communication have failed to deliver any significant throughput due to the harsh multipath and interference conditions present onboard vessels.Recent research and field trials using breakthrough multi-antenna MIMO technology has demonstrated high throughput (as much as 40 Mbps) connectivity on board ships and through closed bulkheads. In this effort we look to develop a tailor made MIMO solution specifically designed to meet the needs of video distribution onboard a vessel. This will be achieved by investigating larger MIMO systems,going towards more advanced MIMO decoding techniques, and a MIMO centric multi-cast protocol. Our proposed solution will be centered around low cost COTS solution and will be small, light weight and easy to deploy."

The US Navy has expressed the desire to develop a fiber-coupled device to allow the LRF transceiver to be located below the waterline. This will free up space within the periscope in addition to reducing the heat signature above the waterline. The Navy has also expressed a desire to reduce the probability of detection of the LRF by a threat sensor. Fibertek, Inc. proposes an innovative solution which addresses both of the Navys desires."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for a compact, fiber-based, low-power laser range finder (LRF) for submarine periscope masts, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Covert Fiber-Coupled Periscope Laser Range Finder (COFIL) that achieves covertness by using a very low power eye safe laser remotely located below the water line using fiber optics, combined with covert waveforms. COFIL incorporates compact optical components including a low-power solid-state eye safe laser, fiber coupling optics, and high-efficiency receiver optics that will allow covert operation of a laser rangefinder for long (15 km) range. The use of a low-power covert laser is made possible by innovative optics that concentrates the return signal on the detector, and a novel pulse waveform; a non-periodic\/short-pulse waveform that further improves covertness. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of COFIL by designing and assembling a breadboard prototype and testing it with various targets that demonstrate its performance. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a prototype and demonstrate methods to integrate it with Navy periscope masts."

RFoF link performance models that researchers at Photonic Systems, Inc. (PSI) have perfected over the last 25 years unfortunately indicate that neither linearized modulators nor coherent detection (the most frequently proposed approaches to high-SFDR links) will enable an RFoF link to exhibit the desired performance. In the approach that PSI proposes to develop for this SBIR program, high SFDR is enabled by a novel integrated electronic linearization circuit, and low noise figure is enabled by suppressing the relative intensity noise (RIN) outside a narrow band surrounding the optical carriers from multiple, wavelength-multiplexed semiconductor lasers. The fact that this approach leverages conventional photonic compoents, and the great extent to which these components can ultimately be integrated, imparts an inherently high degree of modularity and low recurring-engineering cost to links that use the proposed approach. Phase I of the proposed program will include a proof-of-concept demonstration at low frequency, and Phase II will culminate in demonstration of an RFoF link that meets all the above performance specifications."

There are three main issues in regard to using fusion deposition modeling (FDM) on Navy ships, including, the current inability of any FDM feed stock materials to meet the NAVSEA fire, smoke, and toxicity (FST) requirements for materials used aboard ship, the high humidity environment on board ship adversely modifies the process-ability of the feed stock materials, and the ship motion interrupts the orderly deposition of material during the part build resulting in defective parts. Texas Research Institute Austin proposes to develop a feed stock material that will meet FST requirements, develop operational procedures that will counter the high humidity environment, and to devise machine improvements and an isolation mount that will allow the FDM machine to operate through a wider range of ship motions. The proposed effort will result in a FDM system, including machine, material, and processing steps, that will allow the Navy to produce replacement parts on the ship while the ship is underway."

This miniaturization of the Switchblade processing board to a smaller but as capable processing capability is possible due to leaps in FPGA and 3D integrated circuit technology. More importantly, the processor boards that will be discussed in more detail in this proposal have the same software APIs as existing Switchblade tuners, allowing for software application re-use. The proposed 1U (module sized) and 3U processing boards will accept the family of existing and planned Switchblade digital tuner modules due to physical and electrical commonality. Specifically, the two-channel 80MHz instantaneous bandwidth 1.5MHz to 6GHz tuner module, the single channel 500MHz instantaneous bandwidth 100MHz to 6GHz tuner module and the single channel 500MHz instantaneous bandwidth 18GHz frequency range extended tuner module. All of these digital tuner modules were developed or are being developed under various SBIR efforts."

The configuration framework will enable operators to partition EW applications with composeable signal processing operations across offboard buoy and onboard processing resources. A software library of high-level EW applications will simplify sensor processing configuration. Vadum will include advanced algorithms for radar de-interleaving, radar characterization, and communications emitter geolocation in addition to standard radar and communication software elements through partnership with EW equipment vendors. The flexible hardware and software in the buoy solution will dramatically increase the EW surveillance capabilities of US submarines through increased RF sensors deployed from the 3-inch launcher as individual or distributed nodes."

        "abstract": "A significant challenge in managing air quality in closed environments such as naval submarines is mitigating carbon dioxide concentration, which can accumulate to levels toxic to humans through normal respiration if not actively removed. The Navy currently uses liquid and solid amine based chemistries to capture CO2 from cabin air, which require high maintenance and routine regeneration. These systems also are energy intensive and typically can only remove CO2 to a threshold value which is below the toxicity limit but still higher than desired. Proton OnSite proposes an electrochemical method of separating CO2 from cabin air based on ion exchange membranes. The proposed solution would improve energy consumption, reduce operating complexity and footprint, and provide full CO2 removal capacity, with simplified designs that eliminate mechanical and electrical failure mechanisms. Protons capabilities in electrode fabrication, membrane-based electrochemical cells and stacks, electrochemical pumping, and gas-liquid balance of plant design will enable these advancements and lead to a commercially viable product for the Navy and other applications."

        "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) removal is essential to maintaining a breathable atmosphere inside closed systems such as that in a Navy submarine. However, current systems use corrosive materials, are energy intensive, prone to complications, and have relatively short lifetimes. Space constraints within these environments call for a maximization of the amount of CO2 to be captured for a given volume. Thus, the Navy is seeking advanced, affordable CO2 capture technology and materials to fit within, at most, the same volume as current systems. Lynntech has developed a safe and novel solution to address the above concerns by creating a regenerable scrubber based off high surface area functional materials. Lynntech will further development efforts by improving capture through synthetic modification and maximization of capture potential in a typical submarine environment. In the Phase I, Lynntech will synthesize materials, evaluate their capture potential at submarine CO2 concentrations, and tune materials to capture the maximum amount of CO2 at those concentrations. Furthermore, the regenerability of the sorbent will be optimized, with development of optimal regeneration processes for sustained use and reuse. The materials and methods that best meet the needs of the Navy will be recommended for further development."

These materials use amine chemistry to capture CO2 at room temperature and the material is regenerated using heat and vacuum to restore its original chemical state for use in subsequent cycles. The legacy hardware, using the liquid amines, is prone to scaling and other complications from the use of a liquid. These solvents also have a short lifetime which requires frequent replacement, and generates hazardous material wastes that are complicated to handle.TDA Research proposes to develop a high capacity, water stable nano-engineered adsorbent to remove CO2 from submarine atmospheres. We will screen these materials based on their CO2 capacity, selectivity and removal efficiency. We will show that the sorbent retains its activity for adsorption and regeneration cycles under mild thermal swing, vacuum swing and concentration swing cycles (a minimum of 10,000 cycle test will be carried out in Phase I and another 10,000 cycles during the Option Effort). We will estimate the cost of producing the sorbent, and CO2 scrubbing system as installed on and Ohio-replacement submarine. We will estimate the consumable requirements and parasitic power losses."

(Interphase) proposes the application of its patent pending antibiofouling surface treatment (AST) for the safe prevention of biofouling in OHIO class submarine seawater piping and heat exchanger systems (SPSs). Interphase will explore the feasibility of applying its AST to these systems. Interphase AST prevents biofouling by stopping organism attachment as opposed to killing them with toxic compounds. This approach eliminates the need for expensive electrocatalytic chlorine generation systems to be stored on the submarine and be continually powered. Additionally, because it is a non-leaching technology the potential environmental impacts of biofouling prevention are dramatically decreased. Interphase will assess the effects of the AST on heat transfer and biofouling as well as outline a system for the application of the AST to new and in use SPSs. Based on this data, Interphase will provide an anticipated cost benefit provided by utilizing the AST as opposed to current electrocatalytic chlorine generation protocols or simply leaving the seawater system untreated. Interphase AST has the potential to solve the current biofouling on OHIO class submarines through a surface treatment that prevents fouling without the need for constant power or expensive maintenance."

        "abstract": "Adaptive Methods, teamed with Metron,propose to develop innovative approaches, methods and software Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs) to provide a Theater Multi-Mission Planner (TM2P) that is operationally effective andprovides high fidelity plans while remaining computationally tractable.Multi-mission planning and coordination requires focus across large data sets to develop tradeoffs between mission performance and quantifiable risk management metrics which is impractical using todays mission planning tools and methods. Theater planners must currently use a largely manual process to address the appropriate allocation and assignment of resources and assets to real world operational tasking. This manual process is very time consuming and it has the potential to draw operators away from other necessary tasks and risks reducing observations of important information.Our proposed Phase I approach has the overarching objectives of developing a technology basis for TM2P and demonstration of its feasibility using analytic and demonstrative methods. The Adaptive Methods team proposes to develop the initial concept for Theater Multi-Mission Planner (TM2P) capability, with an initial focus on Theater Anti-Submarine Warfare (TASW) in a background of total theater level force missions."

        "abstract": "Navy TASWCs face increasing operational demands with fewer platforms, more challenging targets, and more capable threats.This creates a difficult resource allocation problem inside a tightly coupled and labor intensive planning process.Coupled with complex risk assessment largely based on planner heuristics, this situation is a recipe for overloaded planners, hastily cobbled together plans, limited exploration of alternative Courses of Action (COAs), and poor risk assessment.The main goal of this SBIR proposal is to develop a set of tools that will assist planners to better explore the operational design trade-space and assess risk in candidate COAs, with the goal of achieving the best possible allocation of resources to missions.Sonalysts proposes to leverage TASW planners expert knowledge by combining multi-objective optimization with Fuzzy Logic (FL) tools using a proprietary machine learning method that will be implemented in an automated risk assessment and resource allocation TASW planning tool.Automation of complex resource allocation and providing a transparent risk assessment tool can free TASW planners attention from the minutia of planning, and allow them to focus more critically on understanding and managing risk and risk performance tradeoffs.This will be the first step in increasing automation in the TASW planning capability."

        "abstract": "Heureka and Lockheed Martin propose multiple innovations to automate EIT between the AN\/SQQ-89, AWS, and other C\/S elements. One innovation addresses deficiencies with current automated V&amp;V. For example, AWS testers still perform vast amounts of labor to interpret specifications and manually create test protocols. We propose to automate this laborious process. We have demonstrated how AI can convert Aegis specifications (especially interface design specifications) into Formal Methods components. Automated processes will also use these components to create EIT protocols. Moreover, the plethora of baselines (e.g. 5.3.9, 6.3 with and without ALIS, 7.2, and many B\/Ls to come) demand approaches which automatically create testing from specifications. Another automated test deficiency is that testing is typically oriented merely towards specification coverage. Instead, Navy program managers have suggested that a more honed automated testing strategy should also be based on defects. We have demonstrated automated techniques to analyze Aegis TORs and CPCRs to drive downstream processing; we suggest they could be used for V&amp;V too. In summary, we will use these innovations and others to develop a conceptual framework for automated EIT of SQQ-89 for tactical, test, and training states and modes."

Phase I will result in a robust analysis into the feasibility of using an ultrasonic device to prevent biofouling while a ship or submarine is in port. At the completion of the Phase I Option, HLI will be prepared to conduct a full prototype test. Phase II completion will result in development of a cost-effective, submarine antifouling method or system that inhibits biofouling during in-port periods. Success will mitigate biofouling concerns and free up valuable maintenance resources to meet Operational Availability schedules while reducing life-cycle maintenance costs.

        "abstract": "The attachment of marine organisms (biofouling) to the surfaces of Navy submarines can cause multiple problems including but not limited to: a reduction in top speed, decreased acceleration, loss of buoyancy, increased vessel displacement, loss of stealth and less effective acoustic sensors. Even moderate fouling can reduce a vessels speed. Antifouling coatings applied to the vessels hull reduce biofouling when the vessel is in motion. Unfortunately antifouling coatings are less effective when the vessel is stationary, leading to accelerated biofouling when docked. Therefore submarines are regularly treated in dry dock to dislodge adhered marine organisms by pressure jets and by scraping, a procedure that is very expensive and reduces operational availability. The proposal describes a new biofouling control method that is applied to the hull when the submarine is in port. The hull treatment is continuous and prevents fouling growth before it starts. The method is non-chemical and compliant with existing environmental regulations. It can be applied from temporary equipment, using an engineering infrastructure entirely independent from the vessel. No changes to the hull are required. The Phase I focuses is on scalability, and rapid transition to a practical demonstration in Phase II."

        "abstract": "Biofouling on the hulls of submarines at pier-side is a well-documented problem resulting in losses of billions of dollars from lost usage time and required remediation. The biofouling increases drag and flow noise and interferes with externally mounted equipment and sensors. Biological fouling is also a significant problem to the shipping industry causing significant increases in fuel, maintenance, and downtime costs. Environmental concerns associated with toxic antifouling coatings have led to studies on alternative methods of biofouling control. Acoustic methods for biofouling control have shown significant promise. The use of ultrasonic frequencies for biofouling control appears to be more desirable than audio frequencies since they are outside the hearing range of most marine life. During the Phase I effort Analysis, Design &amp; Diagnostics, Inc. (AD&amp;D) will demonstrate the effectiveness of using ultrasonic emitters to prevent pier-side biofouling using a previously designed, low cost acoustic source with a built-in programmable waveform generator. This work will serve as the foundation for the development of a fully functional Ultrasonic Pier-Side Antifouling System (UPSAS) that will be tested and demonstrated during the Phase II effort."

        "abstract": "The US Navy, or anyone operating equipment in maritime environments, is plagued with biofouling on hull surfaces and in and around seawater support systems. The antifouling coatings that may be effective when submarines are out at sea are not as effective when the boat is static for long periods. The skilled manpower needed, the radiological considerations, and the methods and tools used currently to address fouling in static situations collectively are not cost effective. Boston Engineering proposes to leverage our extensive experience with maritime systems and biological prevention knowledge to provide a modular solution to address the specific needs of the OHIO Class submarine. The solution is versatile and can be applied to many antifouling opportunities within the defense and commercial maritime environments. Our solution minimizes manpower needed by combining the benefits semi-autonomous operation, low energy mechanical work on surfaces and tuned low-contact energy that specifically targets biological forms responsible for fouling. The use of divers is limited. Phase I focusses on biofouling kill rate effectiveness and the feasibility of modular and alternative deployment systems that interface with the hull surface. We leverage existing expertise in system-level design, navigation, controls, and sensing in maritime environments."

MUSTHILP provides a unique modular multispectral design and novel implementation of high dynamic range (&gt;12-bit) SLMs for pixel-wise test scene image generation, and offers super high resolution (8K, needed to test 4K sensors), high fidelity scene projection (simultaneously or sequentially) of 6 sub-bands from UV to near infrared (3801000 nm). It provides real-time performance comparisons of current and future (i.e., COBRA) sensors against a consistent baseline without the need to collect extensive imagery data as in physical trial and error tests. In Phase I, POC plans to establish the technical feasibility of MUSTHILP by performing modeling and simulation, trade studies, optimizing system design and predicting its performance, as well as by material testing, proof-of-concept prototype integration and testing. In Phase II, a working MUSTHILP prototype will be developed for Navys evaluation."

The objective of this project is to develop a reliable bonding process to join UHTC composites to Ti-based metallic components that can withstand aerothermal heating during the flight of hypersonic vehicles, which presents an extreme environment due to aerodynamic heating and shock wave interactions. In Phase I we will formulate a family of braze alloys and form UHTC composite\/Ti-alloy joints. The microstructures of the joints will be examined by X ray diffraction, electron microscopy and electron spectroscopy. Microhardness measurements across the joint region will be performed. Room and high temperature mechanical properties of the joints will be measured, and a potential joint design will be presented."

        "abstract": "Luna is proposing to develop a miniaturized and low power High Definition Fiber Optic Sensing (HD-FOS) system for battery fault detection and early warning. This system would address the issue of thermal runaway where an internal fault initiates heating and an uncontrolled positive feedback loop results in overheating, fire, or explosion. If detected early, warnings can be transmitted before the problem grows, allowing personnel to complete preventive actions. Luna will build a sensing suite consisting of fiber optic strain and temperature sensors. With a measurement point every 0.64mm, the high spatial density will ensure the timely capture of hot spots as well as strain concentrations due to pressure increase. The sensor suite will be interrogated with a ruggedized miniaturized controller that relays warnings to a remote alarm panel. During Phase I, Luna will demonstrate the systems feasibility with repeated simulated conditions. During Phase II, Luna will develop a prototype that satisfies the size, weight, and power envelope (400 cm3, 1 kg, 25 W), and demonstrate accurate fault detection and indication with repeated actual battery charge-discharge schemes. The Phase III effort will support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Advanced Undersea Systems use."

        "abstract": "Several factors (such as overcharge, impact, manufacturing issues, etc.) can produce a failure in lithium batteries used by the U.S. Navy. When a fault occurs, the Li battery can release toxic and flammable gases which can start and feed a fire, cause significant equipment damage, and present catastrophic hazards to personnel safety. Early signals of a battery issue can occur internally. If detected early, the system can provide critical warnings of cell issues before they evolve into more hazardous problems. This proposal concerns the development of an early warning fault indication system (EWFIS) for lithium batteries. The proposed system will allow for extensive monitoring of individual cells at high speed in real-time. It will provide monitoring at the cell level of key precursors of battery fault, triggering an alarm when a precursor is detected, and identifying the cell having issues. As part of the Phase I, feasibility of the device will be demonstrated by exposure to repeated simulated ambient battery environmental conditions. During the Phase I Option, the initial layout of the prototype to be built in the Phase II will be performed. During the Phase II, a prototype will be developed, fabricated, tested, and deliver to the Navy."

(ROI) proposes to develop, demonstrate, and deliver to the Navy a unique compact, light-weight, and ultra-low power, wireless multi-parameter fiber optic environmental sensor (FOESens) system for the in-situ early warning fault detection of Lithium cells and batteries. The miniature FOESens sensor system uses a minimally invasive multi-parameter fiber optic sensor probe to monitor in real time the environmental state of the battery module and detects the potential release of flammable toxic gases, smoke, and particulates to provide Navy operators with an immediate audio\/visual alarm In Phase I of this program, ROI will design and assemble a working laboratory bench prototype of the multi-parameter FOESens system, and extensively tested to demonstrate its capability to detect early precursors of lithium batteries damage. In the Phase I Option ROI will complete the optimization of the signal processing electronics system to enable the reliable and accurate early warning fault detection of the battery environment. In Phase II, ROI in collaboration with a strategic partner will engineer and produce a field deployable FOESens system that can be tested aboard a UUV battery module platform."

Reducing the external connections to a few wires each for power and comm will enhance shipboard integration, logistics, efficiency and EMI suppression. Depending on application, truly plug and play functionality should be possible. Though ships typically have less stringent weight and volume constraints than aircraft and small surface craft, aerospace optimization techniques are fully appliciable. Our fault tolerant BLDC motor, the engine of the actuator, has significantly better metrics than any currently available motor. No specifications are yet available for near term Navy applications so we will study the feasibility of a wide range of packaging alternatives."

We address four key requirements in this project. First, we provide a data management structure at all classification levels by leveraging the existing security infrastructure of WebTAS, an accredited, government-off-the-shelf framework providing secure data management. Second, we propose a data-mining method that can operate across security levels through an approach where data is compressed at lower security levels and then passed upwards, so that the mining process benefits from access to the greatest amount of available information at each level. Third, we include an intuitive user interface enabling searching and displaying information, based on GeoStratus, which provides users with the ability to view three-dimensional plots, workflow, shapes and layers. Our approach integrates GeoStratus capabilities with the taxonomic and faceted navigation search enabled within WebTAS Topic Builder, an operational semantic search capability that provides intuitive access to heterogeneous data sources. Lastly, to achieve auto completion of reports we propose an approach based on hierarchical Active Templates so that reports can be easily filled in with a minimum of manual effort."

In Phase I, we design a modular, expendable electronic warfare decoy buoy that:can be physically configured and programmed to provide DRFM decoy functions against enemy radars operating over a frequency range of 1-40 GHzfits within a mechanical package compatible with the submarine standard 3-inch launcher and can operate at depths &gt;800 feet.is comprised of transceiver and processing subsystems already funded as part of existing NAVAIR and PMS435 programs. Azure Summit leverages ongoing development of a wideband transceiver for PMS435 next generation EW systems and NAVAIR PMA290, as well as extensive experience in developing low-SWAP, wideband software defined radio systems for military SIGINT, EW, and navigation applications. Our partner for the effort, Sparton Electronics, is a supplier of tactical sonobuoys to the Navy and will provide discriminating expertise in both the initial design of the EW decoy buoy and realistic estimation of the unit cost during volume manufacturing."

        "abstract": "Vadum will develop a low-cost, modular decoy buoy (LMDB) that will provide protection to submarines operating at periscope depth by performing Advanced Electronic Attack (AEA) to degrade and deceive advanced enemy radars. As an expendable asset designed for launch from a submarine 3-inch signal ejector, the LMDB will be subject to very challenging Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWAP-C) constraints. Vadum will employ its advanced Electronic Warfare (EW) modeling and simulation tools to establish performance criteria for LMDB based on AEA effectiveness. The performance criteria will be used to derive system and subsystem requirements for LMDB. Analyses will be performed for each major system function: power conditioning, technique generation, and RF transmit and receive to further refine performance requirements. Vadum will survey Commercial and Government Off-the-Shelf (COTS and GOTS) components and identify candidate options that conform to the SWAP-C constraints. Selected components will be evaluated against the derive requirements and competing design options will be assessed through system level simulation of the LMDB in a representative, maritime environment using in-house 6-DoF EW engagement modeling tools. The cost vs. value analysis performed in Phase I will result in an innovative concept design and architecture for LMDB that satisfies the AEA mission"

        "abstract": "Systems and Technology Research (STR) and its partner Harris are pleased to provide this proposal to develop an advanced maritime electronic attack (EA) buoy-based system providing protection for submarines against counter detection from radar systems. Advances in maritime radar sensing capabilities have put U.S. submarine forces at increased risk of detection when at periscope depth. Submarines must maintain their covertness during a variety of missions in both littoral and open ocean environments for which it is critical that they evade radar detection. The STR\/Harris proposed solution is a low-cost expendable electronic warfare (EW) buoy, providing EA deception and detection denial techniques and is housed in a small form factor buoy to fit into a 3-inch launcher that is deployed from the submarine. Our team is in a unique position to provide this compelling solution with STRs extensive experience in maritime radar systems and advanced EA technique development and Harris long track record of developing advanced EW hardware solutions in affordable and small form factor systems with numerous successful transitions to operational systems. Furthermore, STR has direct relevant experience with development and transition for the U.S. submarine community and with small form factor buoy systems."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for an advanced heat spreader technology for GaN-based monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Integrated Nano-Structured Thermal Adapter (INSTA) technology, which applies a novel nanotechnology-based approach, paired with highly optimized system design and materials selection, to produce a robust composite heat spreader capable of effectively managing heat fluxes in modern GaN HPA packages, reducing the hot spot temperatures in the near-junction areas, and assisting in reducing the thermal resistance of the MMIC-heat sink interfaces. The proposed technology is immediately applicable to current manufacturing flows in fabrication of GaN-on-SiC MMIC modules and offers a robust, non-degrading heat management solution that is insensitive to thermal cycling and guarantees long lifetime for the high-duty cycle, densely packaged transmit-and-receive modules in future radar or Electronic Warfare systems. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of INSTA by manufacturing samples of nano-enhanced heat spreaders and validating the performance by measuring the basic thermal transmission properties (TRL-3\/4). In Phase II, POC plans to optimize the manufacturing process and fabricate mock-up MMIC package prototypes to demonstrate the ability to mitigate simulated hot spots in realistic MMIC structures, to propel the design beyond TRL-5."

Innovations to standard OHPs include miniaturization of geometries, optimizing heat transfer rates of the internal fluid oscillations, and (importantly) the ability to manufacture OHP heat spreaders with sizes, materials and extreme survivability temperatures that are required by major defense contractors PA assembly processes which cannot be feasibly re-designed to accommodate the OHP heat spreader technology."

But if these vehicles loiter on the surface to perform their mission, they are susceptible to discovery and capture. A tethered antenna would allow the unmanned vehicle to remain underwater reducing risk from both exposure and damage from surface ships. There is a need for a modular design that can change payloads depending on mission requirements. Adaptive Methods proposes a solution to this requirement. We describe in our proposal our design for a modular, reconfigurable, tethered antenna lift body for undersea platforms that will support two-way Radio Frequency (RF) communication, imaging sensors, broadband Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) antennas, and Global Positioning System (GPS) reception. It can operate at a wide tow speed range and can lift payloads up to 10 lbs."

        "abstract": "Striking the right balance between mission requirements, communications, navigation accuracy, stealth, and risk is a perennial challenge for the Navy in the undersea warfare domain. Beyond the challenge it represents for the submarine forces, that balance represents an acute threat to the effectiveness of the Navys growing fleet of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). While UUVs have achieved significant improvements in mission capabilities, communicating mission-critical information remains a significant impediment to mission effectiveness. Furthermore, effective operations of UUVs in contexts such as Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) demands greater covertness, and has a nearly absolute requirement for the platforms to remain on station, submerged, while collecting and transmitting data to the fleet. In order to provide an affordable solution enabling these missions, Metron proposes designing and developing an innovative, low-cost, scalable, and modular tethered antenna for UUVs. The resulting system will allow UUVs to transmit data, receive instruction, and geolocate without interrupting submerged operations or compromising stealth. Ultimately, this system will allow for expansion of applicable UUV mission types, improving USN effectiveness while allowing for capitalization on the reduced operating costs UUVs can provide."

Physical Sciences Inc., along with its subsidiary Q-Peak Inc., proposes to develop an advanced, compact Raman Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) capable of continuous, automated profiling of atmospheric state variables, including temperature, relative humidity, and pressure to ranges of 1500 m at a spatial resolution of 1 m and temporal resolution of several minutes. A state-of-the-art miniaturized laser design enables a sensor footprint on the order a few cubic feet. The Phase I program will develop designs for the lidar. The Phase I Option Program will address beam steering optics and accommodation of ships motion, as well as additional engineering for the electronics for the laser. The Phase II Program will develop and shore test an engineering prototype sensor. The Phase III Program will integrate and test the prototype on a designated Navy platform."

        "abstract": "Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) is pleased to provide this proposal to address the sensor needs identified in the Navy topic N161-054: Maritime Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW) Environmental Sensing. Atmospheric turbulence can distort the measurements of electro-magnetic (EM) and Electro-Optic (EO) sensors. The Surface Navy has interest in predicting EM and EO propagation from surface ships to support the prediction of radar, electronic warfare, laser, and communications systems performance. Other atmospheric parameters, such as winds, density, visibility, icing, and turbulence are needed for marine aviation up to 5 km. MAC proposes a Direct Detection Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system coupled with an ultraviolet (UV) Raman channel to provide simultaneous wind speed\/direction, density, temperature, extinction, cloud height, water vapor\/ice mass fractions, dew point and optical turbulence. This proven technology will provide real-time, 3-dimensional, altitude ranged environmental state information and has the capability to scan from the sea surface up to 5km of altitude. This Phase I effort will provide the necessary design and modeling basis for a Phase II demonstration."

We propose a dual band polarization imaging system working in the visible\/NIR and SWIR spectral band to increase the detection range when fog and haze is present. Based on a commercially available polarization camera for the visible and NIR band and on an innovative new polarization camera operating in the SWIR band, this imaging system will be coupled to dedicated image processing software. Polarization imaging allows to reduce the amount of light scattered by atmospheric particles as it is partially polarized. Joined with an imaging system working in the SWIR region where the effect of the fog is heavily reduced and a dedicated image processing to remove the scattering, estimation of the detection range will be done to evaluate the substantial overall operational improvement. A prototype of the system will be built and tested in a laboratory environment where condition will be controlled."

        "abstract": "Phelps2020 proposes a multi-sensor system (SAFE) that passively increases operational distances in the maritime environment in the presence of dense fog. The system comprises multiple modalities (EO, SWIR, LWIR) operating in various modes (temporal, multi-spectral, and polarized), and orchestrated via an optimized set of algorithms within a decision making fusion framework. Our solution involves the use of Consumer Off-the-Shelf (COTS) sensors together with proprietary novel algorithms to detect fog and measure visibility distances from EO and IR data. The masking effects of fog are then alleviated via adaptive enhancements to increase visibility by a tenfold. Illumination, color, and heat contrast issues are also resolved via powerful algorithms for quality and interpretability improvement. A multi-parameter fusion is used to jointly optimize sensor usage, guide sensor cueing, selection, addition, or removal according to various reliability and confidence criteria. SAFE is originally targeted to reside onboard military ships at sea, but it will also be a great addition to commercial ships to improve navigation, prevent accidents, and minimize delays. Additional applications are found in other military, government, and civilian domains, via minor customization. One such example is the use of SAFEs software engine with existing sensor turrets on-board manned and unmanned aerial systems."

Specifically, POCs innovative use of multispectral imaging in wavelength bands where the scattering due to fog and aerosols is minimal, coupled with its polarimetric imaging techniques to enhance the image contrast and eliminate the effects of scattered light, without requiring assumptions to be made about the scene, will enable the system to provide enhanced target detection, tracking, and identification in low-visibility environments. Using POMPEII, operators of shipboard and aerial surveillance systems will be able to monitor targets regardless of visibility conditions. POMPEII will offer an extended range of performance, thus ensuring rapid acquisition of necessary information. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of POMPEII by comparing the range and image quality of POMPEII with a baseline and state-of-the-art systems via simulation and experiment. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a stand-alone imager capable of real-time measurements, with a 10X improvement in detection and recognition range over current systems."

A baseline single band EO system is severely impacted by scattering in the presence of fog. Aret Associates will increase the operational range by a factor of 10 over a baseline system in the presence of fog using an innovative, passive sensor and algorithm design that leverages LWIR, visible color and polarization degrees of freedom and employs an advanced multi-modal processing methodology. The innovative Fog Polarized IR-EO Real-time Coherent Estimation and Removal (FogPIERCER) comprises a multi-spectral, multi-polarization sensor suite that leverages available degrees of freedom to best characterize the fog and signal. Since fog varies due to different densities, absorption and scattering particles, the processing stream will utilize a combination temporal and spatial methods employed to best isolate the fog and signal channels. During Phase I existing sensors will be used to collect data with and without the presence of obscurant. This will provide data to demonstrate and assess performance of the FogPIERCER system. For Phase II, plans are to optimize the algorithms and produce a demonstration system to be evaluated under realistic maritime fog environments."

        "abstract": "For Navy F\/A-18E\/F and F-35C pilots, carrier landings remain one of the most dangerous flight procedures. Modern heads-up displays (HUDs) and helmet-mounted display systems (HMDS) visualize integrated information from on-jet sensors and from carrier sensors through data-links with precision ship-relative navigation (PS-RN) to help aircrews perceive and anticipate whether they will be in-phase with the carrier deck during landing. However, the current HUD symbology does not incorporate these new information sources in natural, perceptually useful ways. To address this gap, we propose to use established Ecological Interface Design (EID) theory to design and demonstrate Symbology Improvements Leading to Validated Ecological Representations for HUD Applications to Improve Warfighter Knowledge (SILVERHAWK). We will first conduct a cognitive analysis with 4th\/5th generation pilots to develop an inventory of tasks and perceptual constraints with current display symbology. Next, we will use perceptually driven concepts from 2D\/3D attention, volumetric rendering, and information visualization to design intuitive, high-confidence symbology sets. We will then construct and evaluate working prototypes of promising SILVERHAWK displays within a medium fidelity flight simulator. The resulting SILVERHAWK displays will allow pilots to efficiently perceive and integrate PS-RN information to support stabilized rate of ascent and line-up for precise and safe carrier landings."

        "abstract": "Perhaps the most critical task facing a naval fixed-wing aviator each day is to safely land his or her aircraft on the deck of an aircraft carrier underway that is also pitching and rolling. Confounding this already difficult task is a degraded visual environment in which the key guidance cues may no longer be present. The Navy continually develops new technologies designed to ease pilot workload and enhance safety. One such technology is the Navy-developed Maritime Augmented Guidance and Integrated Controls for Carrier Approach and Recovery Precision Enabling Technologies (MAGIC CARPET). This advanced flight control law provides command and stability augmentation that allows the pilot to directly control glideslope. MAGIC CARPET also adds a new glideslope indicator and reference to the head-up display (HUD) to further reduce workload. This HUD symbology, however, loses its effectiveness in reduced visibility that degrades to zero-zero conditions. To address the need for enhanced display guidance in reduced visibility conditions, a team led by Systems Technology, Inc. proposes the Advanced LAnding Dynamic DIsplay for Naval operations (ALADDIN) that will combine advanced flight director modes with the MAGIC CARPET control laws to guide the pilot to a safe landing regardless of visibility conditions or sea state."

        "abstract": "This proposal is to develop a snap-shot polarimetric camera that operates in the short wave infrared 0.8-2.5um (SWIR). The camera will provide high frame-rate polarimetric data in a compact and lightweight module that will enable deployment in mobile and airborne platforms. Polarimetric enhanced image data has been shown to be highly beneficial for both defense and commercial applications including: target discrimination, mine detection, and remote material identification; however, compact, solid-state solutions do not currently exist in the SWIR owing to the difficulty of fabricating such a device. Our approach is to modify our existing process for fabricating visible sensors utilizing direct bonding of micro-polarizer arrays (MPA)s to a focal plane array (FPA), in order to work with an InGaAs FPA. Previous attempts at this by others found severe crosstalk and poor robustness. 4D plans to address these issues by working with FPA manufacturers to obtain suitable back-thinned FPAs, utilize our proprietary MPA precision alignment system, and knowledge of advanced packaging\/bonding methods. The Phase I effort will validate the polarimetric performance between the MPA and FPA. The Phase II effort will fully develop the MPA bonding process to withstand the temperature extremes of airborne platforms and deliver a SWIR micro-polarizer camera."

In recent years, researchers have applied imaging polarimetry to a number of applications including detection of disturbed earth, detection of objects and swimmers in water, and target detection with background clutter. SWIR band polarimetry has been recently been applied to discriminating between materials for Identification of Friend or Foe (IFF). The application space for imaging polarimetry is increasing the demand for commercially available imaging polarimeters. Polaris Sensor Technology will build a Divided Focal Plane SWIR imaging polarimeter in which a pixelated polarizer filter array will be mated to VGA InGaAs focal plane array. Processing electronics and software will also be integrated to operate the camera and generate real time both radiometric and polarimetric data products. The IFOV mis-registration issue inherent to Divided Focal Plane imaging polarimeters will also be addressed."

        "abstract": "There is an ongoing need to improve the design of low frequency, high power sonar transducers for use in ASW applications. Desired improvements include lowering the frequency, increasing the power, increasing bandwidth, reducing size, reducing weight, and lowering cost. Most low frequency, high power transducers for ASW applications currently utilize flextensional transducers containing piezoelectric PZT type ceramics that are typically field limited, not stress limited. Single crystal piezoelectric ceramics have been investigated as possible improvements to PZT for transduction, because they enhance transducer performance with higher effective coupling, lower Q, and wider bandwidths. A major drawback, however, is that they are costly and are size restricted which limits low frequency and high power usage.More recently, Textured PMN-PT ceramics have been developed. This material has piezoelectric properties that approach those of single crystal ceramics, with the advantages that it can be fabricated in larger sizes with lower cost and can be driven at higher drive levels. Therefore, a transducer made with this material has the potential to produce more source level and can also can be designed to be more compact, lighter, have a broader bandwidth, and higher effective coupling than one using PZT."

        "abstract": "Traditionally low frequency underwater projectors are of the flextensional or flexural designation to permit low frequency operation in a small volume. These devices are normally excited by piezoelectric ceramic commonly identified as PZT. For these devices the power output is field limited as opposed to stress limited. The advent of PMN-PT textured ceramic promises a power output boost that permits at least 10 dB more source level over conventional PZT. This increase in field limit allows the transducer designer to better match the stress and field limits of the particular design. A notional design would be a transducer that is football sized that can achieve a source level of 207 dB with a useable bandwidth encompassing 600 to 1200 Hz. The ability of the mechanism to transmit in an omnidirectional mode and in a directional mode would be an advantage for operational use. Variations on the established classifications of flextensional transducer types would be preferred."

Hypotheses as to the relationships among these four constructs will be generated. Finally, a domain-specific assessment instrument will be developed within which the well-defined performance can be elicited and assessed. The instrument, a Virtual Adaptability Module, will employ a domain-specific approach to stimulate and measure the performance of interest. A series of interactive vignettes and videos will be produced by leveraging procedural content generation to gain efficiencies in development. Adaptive assessment that scales the level of difficulty to individual test-taker proficiencies will be employed to realize assessment efficiencies. The final Virtual Adaptability Module will function as a standalone assessment as well as a component of the Small Unit Decision Making Assessment Battery."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a non-aqueous environmentally benign surface preparation for aluminum pre-treatment process, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Active-Feedback Laser Surface Preparation (AFLAP) system. This proposed surface processing method is based on pulsed laser ablation and a novel use of real-time surface quality monitoring with plasma emission spectroscopy. Specifically, the innovation in making treated surface quality information available during preparation will enable this method for preparing aluminum alloy surfaces with homogenous topography and a high level of purity. As a result, this method will produce a highly wettable surface to enable strong hydrothermally stable anodization, surface modification, or conversion coating of aluminum alloy for low-cost repair and rework of aircraft components, with zero chemical use, which directly addresses Navy requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by building a benchtop prototype using commercial off-the-shelf components and conducting proof-of-concept experiments on a laser-processed, anodized aluminum test specimen in accordance with ASTM standards. In Phase II, an operational prototype with a fully developed ablation head will be built and tested. The proposed system is expected to reach technology readiness level (TRL) 5+ at the end of Phase II."

        "abstract": "An environmentally benign surface preparation process is proposed for aluminum alloy pre-treatment prior to coating and paint application. Surface preparation of aluminum is a critical factor affecting the performance of subsequent corrosion resistant coatings. Arcane methods of surface preparation are currently employed that have been followed by the Navy for many years. These techniques require the use of toxic chemicals that are dangerous to workers health, and at the same time, are very expensive to employ. The proposed treatment process is based on the use of atmospheric pressure oxygen plasma to clean and activate bare aluminum surfaces on aircraft components. Atmospheric pressure plasma is an effective way to remove residual carbon contamination and generate surface functional groups for adhesion. The plasma based surface preparation will replace hazardous cleaning, etching, and de-oxidizing processes with a dry process that uses no toxic chemicals, does not produce hazardous waste, and will yield a much higher level of cleaning and priming than current practice. In addition, chemical precursors will be added to the plasma to produce super tough sol-gel-like coatings that can act as a corrosion inhibitor and paint primer."

These new treatments should result in greater performance and less hazards, wastes, and costs. Air plasma surface treatments have emerged as a safe, fast, and cost-effective means of cleaning and increasing the wettability of aluminum materials. The air plasma pretreatments however require adaptation to aluminum aerospace alloys as well as performance validation. The plasma will be modified to enhance the chemical effects required for improved performance of the high strength aluminum alloys. The effects include suppressing magnesium enrichment in the surface oxides, remediating interfacial copper intermetallic particles, hydration, and decomposition of contaminating organics. The proposed work will also establish the ability to non-invasively monitor the quality of the surface treatment.

        "abstract": "The mass and cost of low temperature Joule-Thomson and Brayton cryocoolers can be greatly reduced with a better recuperator configuration. CU Aerospace (CUA) and team partner Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) propose to develop a robust, anisotropic recuperative heat exchanger capable of excellent heat exchange efficiency with low cost and low mass. This technology relies on 3D weaving of sacrificial fibers into a polymeric matrix, which are subsequently vaporized to obtain a uniform array of capillaries. By weaving these sacrificial fibers with a perpendicular array of copper wires and using computational modeling to optimize the design, this device can achieve good lateral thermal conductance while retaining very low parasitic heat conductance. This recuperator geometry can be tailored to a wide variety of cryocooler temperatures and heat loads by scaling the width and length of the recuperator. The performance benefit derived from the inherently anisotropic thermal characteristics of the woven structure will lead to a new class of low cost, high performance recuperator configurations beneficial for many cryogenic applications requiring counterflow heat exchange."

        "abstract": "Superconducting radiofrequency receivers, optical absorption energy sensors, and quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize digital communications for UAVs and satellites. Development of low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) cryocooler technology is essential since these communication systems must operate at cryogenic temperatures. An attractive cryocooler option for these applications is turbo-Brayton cryocoolers which have high performance at low temperatures. For these cryocoolers, high performance recuperators are needed to transfer heat between the high and low pressure gas streams to reduce the required cryocooler input power and provide cooling at the low operating temperatures of the communication device components. The SWaP-C of the cryocooler is highly dependent on the recuperator characteristics. We propose to develop a compact, lightweight, and low cost recuperator focusing on the temperature range between 4 K and 25 K. In Phase I, we will size the recuperator core components through thermal performance analysis, perform fabrication trials for key features and processes, and assess manufacturing costs. In Phase II, we will build and test a prototypical recuperator."

The coherent pulse stacking technique coherently adds multiple lower-energy pulses together and has been demonstrated up to enhancement factors of 9x with a clear path to enhancement of greater than 80x. Such a source would provide high energy, ultra short pulse pulses from a fiber laser platform without the disadvantages of bulky diffraction-grating stretcher and compressors.

We propose to use transverse mode selection in large aperture master oscillator followed by coherent beam combining approach in order to increase the energy of ultra-short pulse lasers without chirped pulse amplification. This approach is based on the advances in volume Bragg gratings technology development. We recently succeeded in recording of multiple transmitting Bragg gratings inside a single plate of PTR glass. Recording of gratings with orthogonal planes of diffraction allowed transverse mode selection for two axes simultaneously and therefore allows single transverse mode operation of multimode solid state lasers. It gives us additional opportunity to use large aperture glass\/crystal gain media and high power pump diodes keeping the high beam quality. The use of multiplexed transmitting gratings with parallel planes of diffraction will be used for coherent combining of several large aperture oscillators."

        "abstract": "Hemorrhage remains a largely unsolved problem and a leading cause of preventable deaths in both civilian and military arenas. Component blood therapy constituting of equal ratios of pRBCs, fresh frozen plasma and platelets have been shown to decrease mortality in hemorrhage patients. Platelet units are currently unavailable at forward operating military treatment facilities due to their short shelf life. Collection of platelets from volunteer donors for just-in-time use is a possible alternative to overcome this shortcoming. Current platelet apheresis instruments are bulky and power-hungry making them unsuitable for field-use. The proposed effort aims to develop a portable platelet apheresis system based on inertial microfluidics to separate platelets from whole blood. The developed system will be lightweight, power-friendly, ruggedized and have a small footprint making it suitable for use in forward deployed settings. The system will include on-board sensor for accurate determination of platelet counts to provide for optimal platelet yield during the donation process. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of engineers, scientists and physicians with experience in microfluidics, sensing, integrated systems and blood banking to successfully develop the proposed system."

        "abstract": "Hemorrhage is the main cause of preventable deaths on the battlefield, and the survival of soldiers who suffered a catastrophic wound is inversely proportional to the speed of receiving blood or blood components. In the expeditionary environment transfusion using stored whole blood is not realistic due to the stringent storage requirements for whole blood. Using a donor is also not possible because the removal of substantial intravascular volumes of blood leaves the donor temporarily out of the fight. To overcome these drawbacks, Naval medical facilities store the components of whole blood; except for platelets which have a shelf life of only five to eight days. Field apheresis will allow platelets to be collected from a single donor, on site, so that they are available to the severely injured.TDA Research, Inc (TDA), in collaboration with University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB), proposes to develop a compact, single-person carry, ruggedized, battery operated, automatic platelet apheresis device to provide fresh, leukocyte-reduced platelets in the field"

        "abstract": "Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) is the standard method utilized by the U.S. Navy for the corrosion protection of hulls of fleet ships and submarines in seawater. This control system responds to the electrochemical polarization demand of these surfaces, and employs feedback voltage from silver\/silver chloride reference electrodes, measured against the voltage of the ships hull. Evolution of electrochemical cathodic surface polarization, as well as environmental instability of reference electrodes, is a direct product of seawater chemistry in the hydrodynamic boundary layer on the hull. In-situ monitoring of oceanographic chemical parameters is needed for accurate ICCP operation.Lynntech proposes the development of a ruggedized Lab on a Chip (LoC) sensor, which will be implemented into existing ICCP reference cell package. During the Phase I project, feasibility will be demonstrated through simultaneous sensing of the key oceanographic chemical parameters, pertinent to corrosion control, on an integrated circuit package in a laboratory environment. During the Phase II project, a prototype Lab on a Chip sensor package will be developed and integrated into a shipboard ICCP reference electrode holder to demonstrate sensor operation for a minimum of six months in a natural seawater environment."

Our innovation stems from our patent pending valve-less fluidic switching (VLFS) technology that we have developed for a myriad of microfluidic automation applications. The LOC sensor is compact and inexpensive with a full automation capability, specifically designed to perform autonomous measurements with sensitivity and precision that are only currently achievable with laboratory-based instruments. During Phase I, we will develop the LOC sensor to meet the precision requirement of measuring chloride, bromide, sodium, calcium, sulfate, sulfide, and conductivity. During Phase I Option, we will integrate the commercially available miniature temperature, pH, and dissolve oxygen sensors to our LOC sensor. The overall Phase I goal is to determine the feasibility for the development of the ruggedized LOC sensor that can be integrated into a shipboard corrosion control system. We will demonstrate this feasibility through simultaneous sensing of all the key oceanographic chemical parameters in a laboratory environment in order to meet the design and performance metrics required for in-situ monitoring."

This will include optimized epilayer and device design, fabrication and on-wafer characterization. High-temperature and switching characterization will be conducted during the Phase I Option period. A technical feasibility study on the design of the medium-voltage power module is also targeted for the Phase I Option period. ABB Inc. has expressed strong interest in partnering with GeneSiC with their open-standard LinPak platform, which is specifically designed for low-inductance medium-voltage SiC phase-leg modules.Building on the Phase I results, the Phase II program will deliver a fully-qualified 6500 V\/100 A dual-half bridge power module to the NAVY program manager, and demonstrate operation at the requisite voltages, currents and junction temperatures."

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, tremendous efforts have been invested in developing high voltage SiC power switches. At present, SiC unipolar power switches including MOSFETs and normally-on JFETs have been commercially available at voltage ratings up to 1700V. However, medium voltage (&gt;3300V) SiC power devices are still not commercially available mainly because of the very high cost of high quality medium-voltage SiC epi-wafers. There is a strong need for a cost-effective medium-voltage SiC power switch that can be commercialized and moved into mass production quickly. In this program, United Silicon Carbide, Inc. (USCi) proposes to develop such a 6.5kV SiC power module based on the technology of series-connecting multiple commercial available low-voltage (1,200V to 1,700V) SiC normally-on JFETs. The proposed approach has substantial performance advantages over the medium-voltage SiC MOSFET solution. For example, the proposed approach has a higher threshold voltage (&gt;3V at 150C) providing higher noise immunity, can be driven by a conventional gate driver for ease to use, and has an excellent built-in antiparallel diode with a knee voltage of only 0.7V."

New ionic liquid propellants, such as hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN), are being qualified as viable hydrazine replacements. A propulsion system designed to maximize the electrochemical nature of the environmentally friendly, low vapor pressure, low toxicity, HAN propellant is advantageous, as it has the potential to significantly reduce the size and simplicity of the propulsion system. Liquid propellant-fueled TDACS can significantly improve thrust profile, flexibility and overall system efficiency. In support of this mission, Plasma Processes will develop the electrodes and a reliable electrical control system for the safe and responsive ignition of HAN-based, monopropellants. Innovative catalysts will be applied to the electrodes to enable faster response times with lower power requirements. The targeted insertion path is in TDACS for SM-3."

The thruster will produce these short delay times with low power consumption using a novel monopropellant decomposition strategy and a high performance electrode arrangement. The ignition technique is particularly suited for thrusters on vehicles with volume- and power-limited envelopes. In Phase I, we will optimize the thruster design and measure key performance metrics in combustion tests. The Phase I will conclude with a 25 lbf thruster design. In Phase II, we would test the Phase I design to show that low power consumption is feasible for a wide range of thrust requirements, and that the materials selected can survive the high-temperature, corrosive conditions of repeated long-duration burns. Upon successful technology development under the SBIR program, full-scale protoflight systems and SM-3 DACS systems will be developed in technology transition programs."

        "abstract": "Some advanced liquid monopropellants provide the unique property of ionic conductivity, which opens the possibility of using electrolysis for ignition. In recent work for the Navy, Ultramet demonstrated electrolytic decomposition of two different ionic liquid monopropellant formulations. The results of those tests were reduced to key design principles that will be used in this project to develop hardware. The design to be pursued is based on a simple, robust fabrication process used in industry for the manufacture of similar devices. Ultramet will produce the hardware and Pennsylvania State University will evaluate the electrolysis units using established techniques. The most important metric for a successful system is achieving the reaction time necessary for divert and attitude control system (DACS) thrusters on missile defense kill vehicles, meaning that propellant ignition must be very fast. To this end, the Penn State tests will focus on designs that enable propellant reactivity at very short time scales."

RACAK uses fumeless, safe, nontoxic welding compound that is made of readily available materials. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate RACAK at lab scale under low-cycle tension-tension fatigue loading conditions. In Phase II, POC will refine the RACAK methodology, expand the low-cycle fatigue testing and analysis to capture higher stress levels and increased stress state complexity with constant and random amplitude fatigue spectrum loading, and demonstrate crack arresting capabilities for full-scale structural components. Detailed numerical analysis will be performed on the experimental testing to develop the loading scenario, facilitate the estimation of a fatigue lifetime limit, and demonstrate the ability of the technology to arrest crack growth or significantly decrease the crack growth rate and increase the load cycles to failure of the repaired plate."

        "abstract": "The new high-speed aluminum vessels in use by the Navy are designed to preclude crack initiation; however, experience with aluminum structures has demonstrated that plate cracking will occur and grow at an accelerated pace compared to other metals. Permanent repairs are expensive, time consuming, and hence, not feasible for the shipboard environment. The processes that represent the state-of-the-art are expensive, difficult and potentially hazardous to install, and are not able to simultaneously arrest crack growth and provide a watertight seal. Our novel solution to provide a robust repair of cracked aluminum alloy (5000 series) structures on Navy ships is our handheld Compact Repair System (CRS). We have adapted a conventional solid-state welding process currently used for large-scale manufacturing (conventional friction stir welding) and miniaturized the technology to facilitate the repair of cracks. Our CRS is ideally suited to portable systems for shipboard structural repair applications. During the Phase I project, we will assemble the CRS, complete repair testing on relevant materials, and design the prototype for shipboard repair. During Phase II, we will complete the system design, fabrication, and testing and transition the technology to the Navy fleet."

The proposed approach takes advantage of experience with in-port composite repairs of damage to CG-47s. Current repair technology, developed by proposal team members, is technically successful, but requires trained experts to successfully apply, and is therefore not useful for repairing damage discovered while at sea.The proposed system addresses current issues by providing ships with prepackaged composite patches, impregnated with resin, that use simplified methods for application of pressure, and cure at low temperature to avoid additional sensitization damage. In Phase I resin, fiber and user-friendly curing methods will be selected, a generically applicable laminate designed, and a kitted system that can be applied by ships crew demonstrated. Phase I will include hardware tests showing a return of damaged aluminum structure to original strength and stiffness. Patch design and testing results will be supported by 3D FEA. A sailor-friendly repair catalog will be developed to guide at sea repairs by minimally trained crew. Commercialization path is patch kit, plus simple instructions, allowing crack growth and water intrusion to interior spaces to be halted without affecting a ships mission."

        "abstract": "As critical embedded systems age or their requirements shift, it is imperative that the firmware running these installed systems can be upgraded and extended long into the future. Yet the tremendous variety of embedded system architectures currently in use makes it difficult for a developer to maintain expertise across many devices. GrammaTech proposes SCALPEL, a tool for rewriting embedded firmware using high-level views of the target binary. SCALPEL will enabledevelopers to write patches at a high level of abstraction, while automating the process of implementing the patch on the target architecture. SCALPEL will greatly reduce the patch- development workload by separating concerns: the developer may focus on what the patch must do and where it should be applied, leaving SCALPEL to determine how to implement the patch safely and with minimal disruption. SCALPEL also presents high-level, decompiled views of thefirmware image to the developer, aiding in detection of bugs and enabling patches that reference or modify source-level entities. SCALPEL builds on top of GrammaTech&apos;s mature multi-platformstatic analysis tool CodeSurfer for Binaries by presenting a streamlined and user-friendly API that generates safe, low-level rewriting operations to be executed by CodeSurfer&apos;s rewriting engine."

ASC will utilize GENOA software to predict bulk thermal response, solidification, deflection, residual stress, damage initiation, crack propagation, and post-fabrication mechanical performance of simple geometries fabricated via SLM. Real test data will be collected in order to accelerate material qualification and numerical model validation. ASC will exploit thermal monitoring and process control to determine relationship between SLM process parameters (laser power, laser beam diameter, scanning speed, hatch space, absorption rate, etc.) and thermal history in order to reduce the occurrence of porosity and residual stress formation during the additive process. Working with subject area experts. ASC will undertake component-level modeling and simulation optimized fabrication, based on multi-objective SLM parameter optimization. Utilizing gained relationships between process parameters, thermal history and microstructure, parameter inputs required for fabrication of components with tailored mechanical properties will be determined."

CALPHAD-type modeling along with materials property and process evaluation will be applied to make an intelligent selection of commercial heat exchanger (HX) alloy(s), or composition optimization, suitable for AM. ICME models will be developed to describe materials properties and processing, and the ICME methodology will be applied to assess commercial HX alloys in terms of AM processablity. A parametric approach will then be used to downselect alloy(s) of interest, followed by test coupon-scale direct metal laser sintering fabrication and characterization. QuesTek will partner with GPI Prototype and Manufacturing Services Inc., who will provide assistance in material procurement, AM process evaluation and test coupon prototyping. Test coupons of selected alloy(s) will be printed and characterized for proof-of-concept while further addressing one of the unique challenges of building HX components; component thinness. The Phase I program will ultimately conclude with an integrated, predictive mechanistic based computational tool to predict alloy processability for powder metal AM processes, and the methodology will be tailored to HX alloys ultimately minimizing defects and improving component reliability."

The conformal geometry of the cooling channels will be developed in order to attain higher thermal efficiency as compared to a commercial benchmark. The cross-section of the cooling channels will be evaluated for manufacturability using the selective laser melting process. Thermal FEA and thermal-CFD analysis will be utilized to develop the HeX design. The SLM process design will be performed using thermal-CFD analysis of the melt pool physics as well as residual stress and distortion analysis of the build. Two test articles will be fabricated using the SLM process. One of the articles will be destructively tested in order to characterize the uniformity of weight and wall thickness. The second test article will be interfaced with laboratory equipment in order to perform stress tests and to characterize its thermal efficiency. The ICME procedure will be utilized to determine the potential failure locations and the HeX design will be modified in order to include sensor ports for the collection of data that can be utilized to support qualification."

        "abstract": "Alphacore proposes to design and implement the desired Analog to Information Processor (AIP) converter capable of directly converting RF (radio frequency) signals to information. Analog to feature\/direct-information converters has been widely researched across various methods of implementation (including use of optics, magnetic field storage and so on). The hardware implementation of such systems has not yet been evaluated for RF (radio frequency) bandwidths due to the impact of circuit impairment on performance limitations. Although the AIP architectures facilitates slower ADCs, the signal encoding, typically performed by a mixer-like circuit, still occurs at the Nyquist frequency of the input to avoid aliasing. The jitter and aperture of this mixing stage limits the achievable AIF resolution. Alphacores solution to this problem is our innovative high input bandwidth and high linearity (&gt;12 bits) non-uniform input sampler and filter which has a very low jitter at these Nyquist frequencies. Since the architecture do not require an ADC with sampling rate higher than 200Megasample per second (MS\/s), the power savings will be significant, potentially more than 90%. The computational load for the DSP will also be reduced to a fraction as compared to existing solutions."

Maturing methods to model fatigue life benefit as a result of compressive residual stresses are needed to enhance the implementation surface residual stresses for fatigue mitigation. Modeling the benefits of residual stress and life prediction fits perfectly with this umbrella to promote the benefits of these processes. The predictive modeling tool being proposed would be integrated into not just turbine engine components but for any metallic component being considered for fatigue improvement."

        "abstract": "In modern military and commercial aircraft turbine engines, high cycle fatigue and foreign object damage are significant contributors to sustainment costs. Foreign object damage is most acute on the thin leading edges of titanium airfoils. Objects inadvertently ingested in the engine include small stones, aircraft fasteners, and birds. When these objects impact the rotating titanium airfoils, damage such as dents, nicks or tears result. Left undetected or uncorrected, this damage provides an ideal initiation site for high cycle fatigue cracks to form and propagate within the airfoil. Once these cracks reach a critical length, the airfoil will fracture resulting in significant secondary damage and a possible in-flight shutdown of the engine. The proposed program will develop an analytical tool for the design and repair of high cycle fatigue resistant integrally bladed disk airfoils. The analytical tool will be able to account for residual stresses while incorporating the probabilistic variability of airfoils. The analytical tool will serve to support airfoil design and will also be applicable to various airfoil repair cases."

Technical Data Analysis Inc. will develop a novel HCF life assessment technology along with an associated software package to analyze and predict total life of blisk aerofoils and other components in aircraft engines.TDAs life prediction software will be useful both at the design stage as well as during service to deal with a repair question. The software will assist the engineer to deal with the two key questions he will face during design as well as maintenance: (1) how to calculate the life of a blisk aerofoil with a given residual stress profile for intact and FOD cases and (2) what should the residual stress distribution for a desired life be for intact and FOD cases. The software will have ancillary tools for residual stress prediction from laser peening and stress relaxation effects. Noting that probabilistic component is very essential to life prediction due to uncertainties in the input, the software will provide life calculations with probabilistic components."

        "abstract": "The increased use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to meet diverse Navy mission requirements has been accompanied by mounting safety concerns. Mishap rates are orders of magnitude higher during unmanned versus manned flight. Two significant human causal factors contributing to UAS mishaps are channelized attention and fatigue. Channelized attention refers to allocating attention to a channel of information at the expense of other, potentially more important channels. Fatigue caused by long shifts and the around-the-clock nature of UAS operations exacerbates channelized attention. A training system is needed to counteract channelized attention in fatigued UAS operators. To satisfy this demand, we propose to develop ATTICUSAttentional Trainer To Improve Control of Unmanned Systems. ATTICUS has three components: (1) A simulation testbed for training attentional skills; (2) A methodology for assessing fluctuations in fatigue; and (3) A protocol for adapting training based on individual attentional skill levels and fatigue state. The simulation testbed trains operators on visual scanning, resource allocation, and interruption managementthree general attentional skills that underlie aviation performance. The operators mastery of these skills along with their fatigue state are used to adapt the training content delivered. This micro-adaptive training approach will maximize learning efficiency and level of achievement."

        "abstract": "An increasing need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions has led to a critical need for UAS operators and imagery analysts to maintain constant attention throughout extended shifts. Fatigue inevitably leads to a lapse in vigilance, causing degraded performance and an increase in errors. Current training techniques do not address this issue, focusing primarily on job-related technical skills, and are rarely adapted for individual differences in learning characteristics. In response to this need, Aptima will develop ALERT2: Adaptive Learning Environment for Reliable Training Transfer. ALERT2 will be an adaptive system for generating individualized instruction focused on developing sustained attention. ALERT2 will conduct real-time assessments of trainee performance, mission states, and UAS-specific factors throughout a training exercise to dynamically adapt scenarios for optimized attentional training. By integrating with existing training systems and adapting existing scenarios, ALERT2 will provide a lightweight, cost-effective method for training sustained attention in UAS operators and imagery analysts."

Often, these incidents are the result of operator attentional issues. QIC, in partnership with GameSim and Dr. James Szalma, propose SkySpotter, adaptive videogame-based training to address this issue. The SkySpotter concept involves a pre-assessment of trainee state, followed by scenario-based training in a game environment representative of UAS operations. Transfer is assessed in a test scenario at the conclusion of a training scenario. A user profile stores and manages performance data and adaptive algorithms select subsequent scenarios based on these data. In this proposal we describe the concept for SkySpotter and outline plans for development and commercialization."

UAS operations are uniquely characterized by intense performance demands, continuous operational and combat stressors, and catastrophic consequences of performance failures. A critical risk factor challenging operator attention skills is vigilance-related fatigue. Adaptive Immersion Technologies will develop a simulation-based training system that delivers adaptive, customized scenario content to trainees on portable computing devices, computer workstations, and virtual reality. Incorporating three levels of adaptationAptitude-Treatment Interactions, adaptive task priorities, and adaptive cue fading, the system will function to isolate vigilance related attentional challenges and provide an iterative skill assessment and scenario adaptation cycle to foster the development of strategic attention allocation skills. The foundation for this cycle is a psychometric framework for accurate cognitive skill assessment and diagnosis. Working with our transition and commercialization partners, the product will be optimized for transition into UAS training systems as well as emerging personnel selection and assessment programs."

However, the current design and engineering tools cannot fully exploit the design freedom brought about by advanced AM processes. In addition, many existing topology optimization tools are unable to directly address key air platform performance metrics such as strength, fatigue, aerodynamics, shock, and vibration. To tackle these deficiencies, Adjoint Technologies proposes an innovative material and structural design software by extending a revolutionary bio-inspired topology optimization technique to metal additively manufactured air platform structures. Relevant AM design considerations will be directly integrated into the topology optimization including process-dependent material properties and geometric constraints to ensure build-ability and to accommodate powder removal. The tool, which will be capable of discovering complex, high performance structural configurations specifically adapted for additive manufacturing, will be demonstrated for the topology optimization on a benchmark naval air platform component."

        "abstract": "Topology optimization (TO) has become a relatively mature field utilized in the fields of aeronautical, civil, mechanical and materials engineering. For a given design domain, TO seeks to find the optimal distribution of material to maximize some performance metric (e.g. compliance, stiffness, strength) subject to constraints (e.g. max weight, cost, manufacturability). The typical case study is to find a maximally stiff structure given a minimum weight or volume of material.Successful, accelerated, and cost-effective utilization of TO for additive manufacturing requires accounting for anisotropic material data.Insertion of microstructure-based anisotropy into TO is expected to produce a transformational shift in the current practices utilized in designing aircraft parts for metallic additive manufacturing. MRL&apos;s Topology Optimization for Additive Manufacturing (TOAM) will enable the integration of location-specific microstructure anisotropy in the design and manufacturing of air-platform structural components. The feasibility and practical implementation of the proposed effort will be demonstrated initially by the integration of TOAM into commercial finite element tools."

Using MOTSDA, operators will focus on promising alerts and regions of high interest that are generated by new automatic target discrimination techniques and a new snippet to alert management operator aid. MOTSDA provides an automatic closed loop search and target alertment capability that works across wide geographic areas independent of operator fatigue and proficiency. MOSTDA will improve active sonar system target discrimination performance by using a new classification feature and display. These improvements promise to reduce operator workload and improve target discrimination performance of future Air ASW sonar systems.Key innovations include a confirmation tracklet detector that uses a short number of pings to confirm a target echos presence.

        "abstract": "The Navy is facing more sophisticated Undersea Warfare threats as the technology and tactics of our adversaries improve, and the use of complex multistatic sonobuoy fields offers significant advantages in detection of these threats. Due to the size and complexity of the processing of multistatic fields, more information is generated than sonar Operators can manually evaluate. Adaptive Methods, teamed with RDA Inc., proposes to develop an innovative method of reducing clutter and detection prioritization for software TDAs that organize and highlight high contact probability data. Our approach is multi-fold, first we propose reducing the overall false alarm rate by adding adaptive signal processing to reduce sidelobe leakage caused by acoustic interference. Additionally, we will incorporate Adaptive Pulse Compression classification feature extraction to delineate contacts. The third step is using these extracted features as inputs to a machine-learning algorithm to produce a single contact probability score. The final addition is to adjust these probability scores based upon a kinematic evaluation of the contacts against previously processed data from the sonobuoy field data. We believe the addition of these techniques will reduce the false alarm rate and the TDAs will guide the Operator to the highest quality contact data for review."

        "abstract": "Spatial perception in the cockpit remains paramount for safe and effective flight. Unfortunately, transitioning from aided to unaided flight has profound effects on pilots accuracy of spatial perception, increasing the cost of effective attention switching and reorientation to key environmental information, particularly an issue with limited visual cues in degraded conditions. Improved displays are required to support accurate perception of township orientation and movement during precision maneuvers. To address these challenges, we will design and demonstrate an Ecological Advanced Support Interface Toolkit for Heads Up Attention to Improve Warfighter Knowledge (EASI-HAWK). EASI-HAWK will enable efficient transition between aided and unaided vision through natural visual and auditory cues that extend beyond the foveal visual system. These cues will enable robust, direct perception and disambiguation of orientation and motion cues critical to maintaining awareness of aircraft and executing effective control responses. EASI-HAWK will build upon ongoing research efforts and a mature development platform for rapidly prototyping and evaluating novel 5th generation cockpit display strategies to rapidly demonstrate promising display approaches. These prototypes will be used to evaluate EASI-HAWK in supporting pilots. While we will initially target displays for the JSF pilots, component technologies can be rapidly extended and deployed to other aircraft."

If the visual system is compromised, spatial discord can lead to aircraft loss of control. The current state-of-the-art in miniaturized Inertial Measurement Units (mIMU) presents an opportunity to develop a fully self-contained and wearable tactile attitude-indicator to augment attitude information through the somatosensory system. The goal of the proposed program is to produce a tactile attitude-indicator using a body-worn fitted garment integrated with a mIMU and to demonstrate its ability to enhance spatial awareness through flight tests. In Phase I, a prototype free-standing undergarment shirt will be fabricated that provides intuitive attitude cues via the somatosensory system in the aviation environment. The collaborative research team includes flight testing facilities and an academic institution with expertise in human orientation and balance."

It also includes an audio cue that leverages differentiation between the left and right ear playback of a sound to indicate aircraft roll and an orthogonal change in timbre to convey pitch. Cybernet proposes to implement this dual-mode peripheral cueing (DMPC) system, which is a proof-of-concept for each of these two cueing modes, test and adjust them individually and then together to determine and maximize effectiveness. We will also evaluate and minimize the capacity for these cues to distract or otherwise degrade the performance of the pilot. For example, a visual cue must not occlude important cockpit and external visuals, and an audio cue must not hinder communication."

        "abstract": "Spatial disorientation is the inability of a pilot to accurately determine aircraft attitude. It is responsible for a significant amount of fatal accidents in aviation. The human body collects this information by the visual (eyes), vestibular (inner ear), and somatosensory (skin and muscle) system. However, during flight the only reliable information for the aircrafts attitude is provided visually to the pilot. Instances such as very low ambient light, transitions from aided to unaided vision, and poor weather conditions can create false illusions of the aircrafts orientation. This spatial disorientation can be fatal if not corrected within seconds. Recent studies have demonstrated that providing information to the pilot using a combination of the visual, vestibular, or somatosensory system can improve the pilots ability to orient the aircraft, and also more quickly and accurately than strictly visual based information. Mid proposes a novel technology that utilizes tactile feedback to stimulate a pilots somatosensory system, and create a multimodal stimulus that provides intuitive response information to assist the pilot in achieving stable and level flight during difficult conditions without only relying upon visual based information."

To document improvements in accuracy and reduction in analysis uncertainty, the project will first compare the novel approach to classical methods for uni-axial random and sine loading. With confirmation of the approachs validity, it will be extended to studies of multi-axial and combined sine and random environments. ATA will also develop a workflow for post-repair assessment utilizing the approach and use it to determine the durability of an example repair on a notional rotocraft component. In the Option period, ATA will encapsulate the method and associated guidelines into a prototype software toolset based upon commercial finite element analysis and forced response analysis software codes. In Phase II, the analytic methodology and software will continue to be matured, integrated with advanced fatigue codes, and validated through correlation with experimental data to achieve a tool that provides efficient assessment of remaining structural life based on repair conditions and operating environment."

Different flight regimes imply different static and quasi-static applied loads, but they also excite different dynamic responses of the structure; this causes the stresses at a critical location to be a combination of quasi-static loads and dynamic vibrations.To ensure the safety, readiness and future condition of aircrafts, an innovative methodology that allows the definition and tracking of damage at structural hot spots is proposed in this work. The methodology is a hybrid time-frequency alternating-domain approach that considers the effects of load interaction, local plastic deformations, and changes in dynamic response of the structure.

The novelty of our program includes superposition of sub-domain frequency solutions to capture the damage induced evolution of frequency response functions, scaled damage accumulation laws with a given energy dissipation to alleviate mesh dependency, characterization of the nonlinear effects associated with plasticity and contact via a time domain solution, coupling with the frequency domain fatigue analysis module with a pre-defined damage map and its associated damage state variables, and development of isogeometry analysis model in frequency domain to characterize complex repair geometries along with their accurate stress prediction. The use of the commercial software (Abaqus) as a base framework can greatly reduce the development cycle and enhance its commercialization viability via a wide variety of industrial applications."

The tool leverages a proven method for capturing and measuring multi-axial stresses in a component and combines it with a novel technique to conduct frequency domain finite element analysis. The method extends the concept of critical plane such that it accounts for both multi-axial stress state and component material properties in order to more robustly estimate the fatigue\/remaining useful life. The method has been successfully applied by our team to a variety of cases both in the Government and the industry with significant gains to the customer. The underlying techniques and methods are agnostic to the type of component being analyzed, thus extending the utility of our tool to many other applications."

        "abstract": "The average temperature of oceans around the world is 51 degrees Fahrenheit and, at that temperature, hypothermia will kill a person in approximately one hour. This makes it critical for over-water aviation mishap survivors to remove themselves from the water as quickly as possible. Immediate access to a life raft by the survivor is vital. However, Naval Safety Center data for a thirteen-year period shows that only 11% of survivors had been able to deploy their life rafts. Furthermore, our interviews with Navy helicopter pilots, aircrew and trainees, consistently revealed that currently used surface flotation devices are not wearable, are cumbersome, are very difficult to deploy and are extremely hard to board. Our lightweight, wearable, pocket-sized raft (Patent Pending) is easily deployed and has a novel boarding system to lift the survivor out of the water. Float testing of our existing prototypes has determined the viability of our designs. Through this Phase I effort, we propose additional feasibility testing and further refinement of our pocket-sized raft design, inflation systems and innovative boarding method."

Our secured, segregated plural component materials package will mix and react through a single ripcord activation system. The released liquid system will expand up to 500% of its original volume, and instantly form durable foam that will completely inflate its folded, sealed, thin plastic containment package into a full-size, single man flotation device. Our foam system will also offer exceptional insulation to the stranded aviator, which will further reduce potential of hypothermia, and greatly increase the aviators chances for survival and rescue. Our system is based upon commercial foam systems that require minimal mixing, and vigorously react in approximately 30-seconds or less. Our material is prepared using highly efficient reactants and catalysts, and is not affected by cold environments. Our system will quickly and completely react when deployed into service, generate a buoyant foam and large amounts of CO2 gas, and offer the performance, size and weight saving package required for the application."

        "abstract": "The Navy requires a life raft that is small and light enough to include with the body-worn survival ensemble. Having a pocket-sized raft at hand helps facilitate successful egress, inflation, and boarding. The required 12 cubic inches of stowed volume is a significant challenge, considering that a typical one-person raft compacts to about 700 cubic inches under vacuum. Safe, Inc. (Safe) has proposed a raft with innovative features to help meet this extreme volume reduction. The raft will be made of material between 1 and 2 thousandths of an inch thick, a reduction of 2 to 4 times compared to conventional raft materials, while retaining sufficient strength and ability to heat seal the seams. The inflator will aspirate outside air into the raft through the Bernoulli effect at a ratio of 12 to 1 to dramatically reduce the volume of gas that must be stored for automatic inflation. The raft will be compressed at high pressure to minimize its packed volume prior to vacuum sealing. Safes project team includes a commercial raft manufacturer with practical experience designing and building rafts and their manufacturing tooling. Safes commercialization strategy assures flexibility to address both military and commercial markets."

        "abstract": "The proposed personal flotation raft is comprised of panels joined to form an enclosure with a canopy. In operation, the design allows a foot-first entry procedure. The user then triggers inflation of the body shell and canopy. The body shell maintains an air gap around the lower body. The design features an above shoulders canopy with a self-sealing aperture that shuts whenever submerged. The raft is constructed from layers that are sealed into an envelope. The body shell establishes an air gap insulation barrier around the user. The canopy remains upright above water even if the raft overturns. The objective of the work is to determine the technical feasibility of a pocket-sized raft design to provide durable flotation and hypothermia protection to aviation mishap survivors in cold water. Three challenges addressed in the development of a pocket-sized raft include, a) raft design and fabrication, including shell and canopy construction, materials, inflation, stability, and packaging, b) raft thermal performance modeling, and c) raft integration with aircrew operations. GAC is proposing to achieve the objective by refining flotation raft requirements; developing an aircrew ConOps; developing a conceptual raft design; modeling thermal performance; and developing raft prototypes for limited testing."

Our non-contact tracking method will combine the flexibility and environmental robustness of optical tracking with robustness of multi-spectral testing against impairment by electromagnetic fields, high-pressure gas flow, vibration and changing surface contamination. The Phase I program will demonstrate the accuracy and speed of this novel approach; the Phase II program will logically extend Phase I research to implement a prototype that can demonstrate performance in a full-scale, full-rate jet-engine test environment. To successfully develop this challenging but highly rewarding technology, we have assembled a cross-disciplinary team of experts in optics, dynamic systems, high-speed algorithms and data processing."

Coupled with our Sensor Interface Unit (SIU) and Data Capture Unit (DCU), the FOCIS system is capable of providing the ultra-high data rates necessary to measure timing at over 60,000 blades per second. It is this high speed, high resolution capability that we will leverage to develop the FOCIS optical torque sensor (OTS) system. With a pair of shock and vibration hardened, high temperature capable FOCIS probes, our system has the capability to characterize torsional twisting of the shaft without modifying the shaft in any manner. Furthermore, the algorithms that Prime Photonics has developed for blade tip health monitoring can be applied directly to shaft torque measurements. Our high speed system can not only provide information about torque, but also provide measures of shaft speed, deflection, and vibrational modes."

ChromoLogic LLC (CL) proposes to develop an Optical, Rotary, Intrinsic Encoder for Non-contact Torque measurement system (ORIENT) to provide accurate measurements of drive shaft displacement, rotation speed, and torque. Based on CLs proven non-contact optical inspection technology to identify and track surface features, CLs proprietary algorithms use the intrinsic microstructure of the shaft surface to unambiguously determine the drive shaft orientation at any instant, without the need to mark, etch, or modify the shaft. To date, this method has been demonstrated on black, painted, matte, and highly reflective surfaces, from plastic, metallic, ceramic, and hybrid materials. This capability permits characterization of drive shafts created from non-ferrous and carbon fiber reinforced composite materials. Finally, this method requires no modification to the drive shaft, is truly non-contact, and as such, can be applied as a drop-in solution to retrofit existing aircraft without the need to requalify components."

The resulting Automated System-level Performance and Characterization Tool for Deck Motion Compensation (ASPECT-DMC) provides an analytical basis for sensor requirements development, estimation and prediction performance evaluation, and closed-loop control scheme verification and validation. Phase I will address fixed wing UAVs, but will be extended to rotor-craft landing on small vessels during Phase II. The uncertainty propagation of CAPE enables simplified uncertainty propagation of the closed-loop control system and exposes the flow-down of uncertainty of each subsystem. This approach computes the performance bounds orders of magnitude faster than Monte-Carlo analysis. In Phase I we plan to leverage our prior work in DMC design, system-level analysis, our current work toward INAV-SL (Image-based Navigation for Ship-board Landing, a Phase III backup landing system for Fire Scout), and use ship and wave motion data from Applied Physical Sciences (APS) to evaluate a prototype DMC system (state estimation, APS-furnished deck motion and prediction, and GNC) with included environmental uncertainty. Phase II will mature the technology by demonstrating robustness to different vehicle models, wave dynamics and uncertainty toward inclusion with the Fire Scout PoR."

        "abstract": "Deck Motion Compensation (DMC) is the process of adapting the flight guidance and control commands provided to a flight control system to account for the motion of the ship and the total effective delay of the system from sensors through computation and communication to control surface actuation. The motion has historically only been compensated (1) in the vertical direction, (2) for purely translational motion of the touch down point (TDP), and (3) using a constant-gain lead-lag filter. These limitations lead to practical weaknesses in existing DMC methods. This is because, as the ship pitches (rotates with fore and aft moving vertically), the aft portion of the ship heaves up and down significantly more than the TDP. Landing aircraft are required to pass above the ramp with at least 10 ft of vertical clearance. The use of a constant-gain lead-lag filter limits the effectiveness of DMC for ship motion beyond the specific frequency spectrum for which the filter was tailored. The approach set forward in this proposal involves replacing the open loop lead compensation with a closed loop compensating approach which makes use of an adaptive ship motion prediction method in conjunction with the aircraft&apos;s linear model phase lag."

        "abstract": "Improving boarding rates while enhancing safety of aircraft operations in the shipboard environment remains a constant challenge for the US Navy. Although significant recent advances have been made for manned shipboard flight operations, critical new technologies are needed for fixed and rotary wing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). One particular need is for autonomous UAS to consistently and successfully board a ship in high sea state conditions. Thus, deck motion compensation (DMC) systems become a safety critical element of the autonomous approach and landing. Ship motion is induced from maneuvering of the ship and disturbance inputs from the ocean and wind. The technical challenge emerges from the difficulty in estimating the ship response to inputs from all of these sources. Systems Technology and the Georgia Institute of Technology thereby propose to develop the Rotorcraft Unmanned Aerial System Deck Motion Compensation (RUAS-DMC) system that will use the Generalized Predictive Control approach integrated with an autonomous system controller to enhance boarding rates. While this method will be developed and demonstrated with a RUAS, ultimately in a Phase II flight test program, the DMC system will be completely general with applicability to fixed wing UAS and any autonomous controller."

The tool is built on the Task-Pilot-Vehicle flight simulation environment from Robert Heffley Engineering. The DMCAT is based upon a Power Approach configuration of the F\/A-18 derived from the CASTLE airframe model. The performance of the DMCAT model is consistent with the Navy&apos;s knowledge base of the simulated and &quot;real&quot; performance of the aircraft. The DMCAT is used to define the cause-effect between critical system design parameters and flight technical errors and recovery performance. The DCMAT provides design guidance for selection of critical system parameters relating to deck motion compensation in sea states 3 through 5. The DCMAT includes a behavioral &quot;pilot&quot; model which provides ACLS Quality Ratings for Mode II operations. The Test Function and Design Guidance Implementation of the DMCAT enables a database of ACLS responses to be developed and managed for different aircraft types and a range of disturbances. The DMCAT allows a user to rapidly prototype: 1) Variants of the baseline ACLS, 2) Integrate new sensor types, 3) Create new airframe geometries such as a flying wing, for example."

After matching the in-situ data to physical parameters that control Transmission Loss (TL), BATTLE estimates the two-way TL for a detection location using different target hypothesis depths and rejects snippets that are infeasible as a submarine target echo. In order to control aircraft computational costs and extend BATTLE to include in-situ environmental hypothesis generation, we will develop a non-linear regression technique to replace the ocean propagation steps in the run-time BATTLE component.Our approach measures the variability of transmission loss during the mission and the degree of variability from ocean physics models. BATTLE automatically adjusts the clutter suppression thresholds to reflect the variability and uncertainty in the ocean propagation conditions encountered during the mission. During Phase I, we will investigate methods to reduce the variability in TL estimation. Our approach to TL based clutter suppression has already shown promise on at-sea data sets."

Receiver sonobuoys use many more beams to listen for echoes or energy of interest. On-aircraft radios concurrently monitor significantly more sonobuoys over a larger field. And overlapping ping strategies ensonify the water from multiple directions and frequency bands simultaneously. Combined, these advances in technology, capability, and strategy deliver tremendous additional amounts of acoustic data. This can overwhelm the ASW operator with information, making it difficult to adequately review all the incoming data, and perform the ASW search mission, using traditional methods and approaches. In a world of emerging and renewed threats, increasing technologies, and shrinking budgets, new methods and tools must be developed to assist the warfighter more efficiently accomplish his task. One approach to reducing operator workload is to use Transmission Loss estimation to help discriminate clutter from possible target echoes. Unfortunately, empirically measuring Transmission Loss or even the environmental state is not feasible or reliable.

(TES) proposes a novel approach to the Navy SBIR 2016.2Topic N162-101 FACE Transport Protocol Mediation and Integration that reduces risk by a) building upon our existing proven toolset architecture and b) by using key personnel that have considerable experience in model-based, communication protocol, and FACE tool and architecture development, as well as a personal and professional stake in the FACE Technical Standard. In support of the former, our response mitigates risk and increases feasibility and success by exposing, analyzing, documenting, and resolving the differences in the ways in which components have defined their messages (i.e., the semantic, measurement, and type model behind the messages) and the transport protocols used to communicate with other parts of the system, specifically, resolving these issues by taking advantage of, and extending, five (5) areas upon which our development tool suite, called AWESUM FAME is built: FACE Data Architecture, System Unified Model (SUM), AWESUM Tool Architecture, Modeling Wizards, and Tool Interoperability Support. For the latter, TES is committing to this project resources with significant and varying interest and experience in model-based development, enterprise and real-time embedded systems and tool development, and the FACE Technical Standard, with broad coverage across"

        "abstract": "The Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) family of standards has made significant strides in providing interoperability and reuse of military avionics software across a common development platform. Significant and troublesome incompatibilities can remain between implementations even with standards conformance. These incompatibilities can arise from a variety of sources and can be subtle and difficult to discover and should be discovered during integration testing. Trideum and its partner StackFrame are pleased to propose an important step towards solving this problem. Our approach levies expertise developed primarily in the simulation interoperability domain and is built on an open source interoperability platform the team originally developed for the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office called Osseus. We propose to develop the FACE Integration Support Tool (FIST), an interoperability schema and a real-time Data Model Verification Logic capability. FIST will allow the automated detection of implementation inconsistencies in the Data Models as well as the ability to visualize and rapidly understand those differences. We believe this is a significant step towards solving the FACE incompatibility issues and is achievable under a Phase I SBIR. This approach also has great benefit for many other domains that may have similar standards interoperability issues."

        "abstract": "Despite gains in component cohesion due to FACEs data-modeling standard and approach, integration of UoPs still presents a significant challenge for system integrators. The UoP data models required by FACE are necessary but not sufficient; FACE does not currently provide mechanisms to describe behavioral aspects of communication such as sampling rates, messaging patterns, latency requirements, and mode changes. These missing behavioral details lead to errors currently detectable only through manual, labor intensive review by system integrators.To assist system integrators working with FACE UoPs, we propose the State Linked Interface Compliance Engine for Data (SLICED) tool. SLICED combines existing timing analysis and FACE data standards with descriptions of the state of a UoP. These descriptions, in the form of a state machine, provide formal documentation of the behavior of a UoP. The novelty of SLICED is its use of a composite state machine to represent system level behavior as a structured aggregation of the behavior of individual UoPs which preserves UoP separation properties and is minimally burdensome to both UoP vendors and system integrators. SLICED integrates with existing virtual integration processes and works in parallel with existing tools without duplicating their capabilities."

        "abstract": "Significance: As technological complexity increases, so too does the cost of integrating new systems. Each innovation yields geometrically more interfaces with which to integrate. Unless we develop a better approach, it will eventually become cost prohibitive to integrate additional technologies. Since integration occurs at the edges, it is necessary to obviate the differences found there with effective data mediation and protocol bridging. Data mediation ensures that interfaces are consistent in their data representation (e.g. measurement units) and the semantics (i.e. they have the same meaning). Although essential, data mediation is not a complete solution. Building on previous work, this project will tackle the integration challenges with systems leveraging disparate protocols. Hypothesis: Protocols can be bridged allowing systems with different protocols to connect without the need for manually created, point-to-point adapters. Preliminary Data: Our team completed some work on protocol bridging for the UCS Working Group which was demonstrated to enable semi-automated connectivity of disparate protocols. Specific Aims: (1) Develop a Configurable Transport Service Segment design. (2) Develop approaches for merging disparate models. (3) Develop how to characterize protocols in a data model. (4) Develop sample mappings of characterized protocol data. (5) Provide feedback to further development of existing standards."

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to create a new type of a complex holographic element which is an extremely narrow band lens or curved mirror created in a phase holographic medium, which is a photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass. Those elements will be used for imaging concurrently with the spectral selection, at a sub-nanometer level, of wavelengths within the visible and near-UV spectra. This innovation is based on thick phase holograms recorded in the bulk of a photosensitive glass, and nonlinear properties of this material. Proposed development will widen applications of PTR glass technology. Limitations imposed by current recording technique based on UV recoding will be overcome. OptiGrate will use patented and exclusively licensed technology from the University of Central Florida for the development. OptiGrate has successfully commercialized a technology of high efficient planar reflective Bragg gratings (RBGs) with spectral resolution of less than 0.1 nm. Within scope of this project technology of narrow band filters with large field of view will be established."

This design is based on Luminits decades of experience with HOE development and prototyping. The innovative use of analog pre aberration techniques and digital diffractive optical elements for wave front conditioning allow to obtain good intra-element and element-to-element uniformity and repeatability, and improved off-axis aberration optical performance. As a result, VMAN offers manufacturing grade production of volume HOEs for imaging and non-imaging applications. In Phase I, Luminit will demonstrate the feasibility of VMAN by building a manual manufacturing prototype at TRL 5. In Phase II, Luminit, LLC plans to further develop the prototype of Phase I to TRL 7 by introducing automation."

This proposed technology is based on size separation of particulates in a cascade impactor and chemical analysis by micro-Raman vibrational spectroscopy. POCs unique sensor innovations will enable TURPIAN to measure size, concentration, and chemical composition of ingested particulates in real time in a small, integrable form factor for use on aerodynamically sensitive turbine engines. As a result, this technology offers the capability to provide in-situ data for improved engine performance and operability, which directly addresses the Navy requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology by designing, analyzing, and preparing technical documentation of the system components for building a prototype in Phase II. A benchtop prototype using commercial off-the-shelf components will be used to conduct proof-of-concept benchtop experiments. In Phase II, POC plans to refine the system design and build a complete prototype for performance testing. At the end of Phase II, the TURPIAN is expected to reach Technology Readiness Level (TRL)-5+ and be ready for initial testing at the Navys turboshaft engine test cell."

        "abstract": "Modern gas turbine engines operating in environments with high particulate concentrations face significant durability, performance, and operability challenges. Ingestion of particulate materials can cause erosion of the flow path components and particles that reaches the combustor and turbine can adhere to these components, adversely impacting the cooling performance. The degree to which ingested particulate is harmful to a gas turbine is dependent on the particle size, concentration, and composition. Unfortunately, no sensors that can be deployed into a fielded engine are currently available to monitor particle size, concentration, or composition. Recently, ISSI has developed an optical measurement technique that can provide particle size, velocity, and acceleration based on direct imaging of particle shadows. Particle shadow measurements are obtained using inline illumination from an LED and imaging the resultant shadows caused by the particles with a digital camera. The size, shape, velocity, and acceleration of the particles can be directly determined from analysis of these images. Particle concentration can be estimated using the number of particles detected per image. Finally, particle density is estimated by monitoring particle acceleration and determining particle relaxation time of the particles This simple measurement approach is based on robust hardware such as LEDs and CMOS cameras."

Hal Technology will enhance the capabilities of our newly developed compact, rugged, flush-mounted, fiber-optic sensor for real-time engine health monitoring. In addition to extending the size sensitivity, the proposed Engine Particulate Ingestion Composition (EPIC) sensor will use an innovative hybrid discrimination approach to incorporate chemical composition identification without compromising the form factor of the current sensor platform. Our sensor platform performs non-intrusive particle measurements with a multiplexed sensor head that has implementation flexibility, reduced thermal management requirements, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and potentially low cost. In the Phase II effort we will build multiple fully functional EPIC sensors ready for evaluation, testing, and integration into selected engine system(s) for operational assessment. During Phase III we will work with the selected-engine OEM to develop a certification plan, perform Category A (ground) and B (flight) testing. Our EPIC sensor can be integrated into an engine control system to allow early warning of excessive dust loading and provide information to help manage the health and durability of an aero-turbine engine."

        "abstract": "Modern military and commercial gas turbine engines are subject to increased durability, performance, and safety issues when operating in austere environments where significant quantities of sand, volcanic ash and dust are present and can be ingested into the engines. These environments include desert regions, as well as, previously active\/currently active volcanic areas. Military studies of turbine engine sand, dust, and ash ingestion have shown that certain constituents, typically those containing CMAS (calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate) compound minerals and\/or Chlorides and Sulfates, are particularly detrimental to engine turbine components. A sensor system that can measure the composition, size and concentration of particles being ingested by a gas turbine while in flight can provide pilots the warning they need to avoid damage mechanisms, both in the military where operational limits are always pushed to the maximum, and in the commercial area where safety is paramount. The Innoveering team is proposing an innovative, compact, rugged, in-situ sensor system that can be integrated at several places within an engine to provide the measurements of interest and communicate a warning to the pilot."

The key innovation in this system comes from use of a novel customizable architecture that modularly integrates individual, high-speed data buses and existing test equipment into a seamless, semicustom testing solution. Specifically, the innovation in testing allows the Navy to handle and unify testing of future high-speed systems without the need for costly personnel training and large-footprint, custom, automated test systems. As a result, REHASH directly meets the Navy need for advanced testing, in addition to cutting costs and reducing mission failures. In Phase I, POC will develop a limited breadboard proof-of-concept prototype and demonstrate it by showing how modular components can be seamlessly reconfigured to provide a variety of types of interface support in a relatively inexpensive and compact format. In Phase II, POC will expand REHASH functionality, ruggedize and optimize its design, deliver and test a prototype and manufacturing plan, including product cost data, and identify a teaming partner to help us take REHASH to full production."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Silicon photonics is booming in areas of system level integration involving electronics and photonics. It has exclusive advantages over other electronic or photonic subsystems when stands alone. On-chip true time delay antenna feed can be significantly advanced using the technologies garnered through silicon photonics. Electronic true time delay antenna feed intrinsically suffers from beam squint effect, to which photonics is the only viable solution. An integration of optical true time delay lines and electronic components would not only solve the beam squint effect but also significantly improve the performance of the antenna in terms of cost, size, weight, and power. Omega Optics, Inc., and the Nanophotonics group at the University of Texas at Austin, propose a high-density integrated 128-channel true time delay module utilizing fishbone slow light waveguide that can operate up to 200 GHz through frequency doubling and quadrupling. A linear modulator with composite phase shifters is proposed to achieve 130 dB\/Hz^2\/3 spur free dynamic range. The proposed module integrates a total of 512 photonic and electronic components including grating couplers, electrical-optical modulators, beam splitters, slow light waveguides, strip waveguides, and thermal phase shifters. With fishbone waveguides, the integration density will increase by five times compared to 2D photonic crystal waveguide based approach, and a time delay &gt; 1 ns can be generated. Which is sufficient to steer antenna wave for 60 degree. The research team not only has intensive experiences in silicon photonics, optical true time delay technology, and design kit development, but also work closely with silicon photonics foundry, which assure the delivery of high quality results.; BENEFIT: The market for high performance phased array radars is a rapidly growing area in both civilian applications (mobile satellite communication, ground-based wireless communications, etc.) and military applications (air surveillance, air defense, etc.). The total market will reach $19.6 billion by 2018. The proposed 1D photonic crystal based true-time-delay lines provide an enabling technology for the construction of high-performance, squint-free, large RF bandwidth beam formers that can be monolithically integrated with other active components and provide distributed control, processing, and reconfiguration functions to achieve active and smart antenna systems with enhanced capabilities. It shows significant advantages over conventional true time delay lines in terms of cost, size, weight, and power consumption, which make it of special interest to aircraft, especially fighters, where capacity and load are limited and precious."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In this work, freedom Photonics is proposing to develop a hybrid integration platform that integrate yielded, best-of-breed optical components on a low-loss Silicon platform to form high performance, phase stable integrated RF photonic systems. This will be done in a highly manufacturable manner, using passively aligned placement of the semiconductor components on the Silicon substrate to form a system in package-type of integration platform for RF photonic applications. This development will leverage off ongoing Freedom Photonics high-performance component technology development, including efficient lasers, low-V modulators, high-power MUTC photodetectors, and a low loss PLC waveguide platform.; BENEFIT: There are several application areas where the developed platform can be utilized. Replacing RF electronics withoptical domain processing is desirable to reduce weight, reduce or eliminate electromagnetic interference (EMI), reach broadband performance not available using standard RF components and allow easier deployment.Current RF over fiber optics systems are typically designed to support hardwired capability into ships, fixed buildings and laboratories. These systems utilize discrete optical components and relatively large electronics components for transceivers and are not optimized for small portable systems. The first planned product for the technology to be developed in this program is a broadband RF photonic link. Subsequent products will be launched for other RF photonic applications in development or applied in various DoD programs, including RF photonic links for avionic applications. In addition to a large number of military applications, this integration platform will also be applicable to many commercial markets, such as cell phone and satellite phone transceivers for home and business use, laboratory remoting, status measurements in nuclear power plants, GPS systems, portable communications, medical instrumentation and industrial control systems."

Preserving fuel that is stored and transported to the battlefield is critical to maintaining a high level of operational effectiveness. Fuel convoys and storage facilities are particularly vulnerable to attack, and in the event of such an occurrence, the fuel must be recovered to mitigate the negative effects this disturbance. Fuel that has been compromised as a result of attack, equipment failure, or accident could contain any number of contaminants including moisture, dirt, soot and aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs). Mainstream Engineering will develop an innovative emulsion-breaking device to separate JP-8 from aqueous emulsions containing AFFFs. Supporting system components will then separate and recover the fuel for reuse. In Phase I, Mainstream will demonstrate the technology at the laboratory-scale. In Phase II, Mainstream will demonstrate a prototype fuel recovery system which will process 10 GPM of fuel.; BENEFIT: This technology will be useful to the military in recovering compromised fuel to improve the overall energy efficiency of military operations. The public will also benefit from a fuel recovery technology deployed at sites of oil spills resulting from natural disasters, equipment failure or accidents."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A new class of hydraulic cement and concrete materials will be developed with desired fresh mix rheology and set time to expedite placement of concrete pavements using common practices, and with favorable hydration kinetics to enable opening of pavement to heavy traffic within one hour after placement. The new materials also provide desired economics, sustainability, heat of hydration, fatigue life, dimensional stability and long-term durability. They can be tailored towards different climatic conditions and construction practices. Three primary principles will be adopted towards development of the new materials: (i) hybrid cement chemistries supplemented with compatible admixtures; (ii) optimum particle size distribution and packing of hydraulic cement, and also aggregates and all granular matter; and (iii) mechanochemical processing to control the dissolution and reaction rates of mineral constituents. The proposed Phase I project will develop and optimize alternative hydraulic cement chemistries, devise advanced concrete mix design procedures, and identify admixtures that are compatible with the selected hybrid cement chemistries. Comprehensive performance, cost, sustainability and safety investigations will be conducted in order to identify the most promising hydraulic cement and concrete materials for further development. The competitive merits and commercial potential of the new materials in pavement repair applications will be verified.; BENEFIT: The new hydraulic cement and concrete materials enable expedient placement of the pavement capping layer, and opening of airfield and highway pavements to heavy traffic within one hour after placement. They offer desired fresh mix workability and set time, that can be tailored to suit different climatic conditions and construction practices. Enhanced fatigue life, abrasion resistance, dimensional stability, resistance to restrained shrinkage cracking, and long-term durability are also among the advantages of the new hydraulic cement and concrete materials. The performance advantages of these materials will be realized at competitive cost, with robust mix designs that can be tailored towards locally available materials. Sustainability and safety are also among the positive attributes of the new hydraulic cement and concrete materials. Repair of airfield and highway pavements are the immediate applications targeted for the new class of materials. The robust nature of these materials enables their broader infrastructure repair applications. Strong commercial partnerships have been formed to facilitate transition of the end products to the targeted markets."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: S. D. Miller and Associates (SDMA) research team has led the field of research in Opacified Fibrous Insulation (OFI) since 2003.Early OFI prototypes equaled the thermal performance of Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) with MultiLayer Insulation (MLI) using gold-coated shields and vastly reduced cost and maintenance of TPS for hypersonic vehicles.In 2015, OFI prototypes demonstrated improved efficiency in Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) TPS, and became part of the preferred HIAD TPS.Research is proposed on specific problems hindering further improvement and commercialization of OFI, including (1) improved consistency and (2) better correlation between theory and experiment.Improvements in these two areas support development of a model that predicts performance from first principles, allowing OFI to be optimized for TPS on future Air Force and other DoD missions, as well as other aerospace and industrial applications.To meet these objectives, SDMAs researchers will team with experts in nonwoven production to demonstrate improved manufacturing concepts, and experts in radiative heat transfer to verify theoretical performance correlates with experimental data.Phase I is expected to confirm that sample consistency improves using scalable manufacturing processes, and that data from more consistent samples provide better agreement with the model based on first principles.; BENEFIT: SDMA will commercialize Opacified Fibrous Insulation (OFI) in fabricated shapes, and supporting engineering services.Initial customers will include aerospace companies that are developing hypersonic systems.Since saving a pound on the Thermal Protection System (TPS) saves a second pound in the airframe, and these savings combined save a third pound of fuel, the total savings on one vehicle studied was 453 lbs., equivalent to $4,530,000 at current launch costs of $10,000\/pound.Specialized insulations will also be developed for other markets and applications.Potential transition partners include the Air Force, DARPA, NASA and the U.S. industrial sector for hypersonic application. Alternative aeronautics markets may also be possible for air-breathing applications, industrial applications such as plasma processing and micro-fabrication techniques."

The ES3 LHE Alkaline Zn-Ni plating process is producing excellent performance results based upon testing to data for fatigue, adhesion, hydrogen embrittlement and corrosion protection coupons, including lubricity testing on threaded fasteners. In Phase 1 of this project, ES3 will investigate cadmium plating alternatives; specifically, conduct the feasibility study and testing necessary for USAF validation for Steel and Aluminum Electrical Connectors, Back-Shells and Components."

Implementation of Zn-Ni coatings across the Department of Defense will lower processing and waste treatment costs, improve sustainability, and increase readiness. Faraday proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of applying pulse reverse electric fields to control and maintain the functional properties of the Zn-Ni coatings, to meet or exceed the performance of the established cadmium coating. The proposed Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of LHE Zn-Ni alloy coatings on aluminum and steel test parts, and elucidate the advantages of pulse reverse processing on coating performance. The Phase I effort will include a detailed comparison of direct current (baseline) and pulse reverse plating parameters, focus on adhesion of the coating to the substrate, characterization of the functional properties of the coatings, and development of a preliminary technology transition plan. The Phase II effort will build upon this effort to further optimize the functional properties of the coatings, expand the technology to chrome coatings, and validate the process on simulated and full-scale landing gear components and perform a system-level validation test."

Currently, the generator testing uses resistive load banks, meaning that all of the energy is wasted. To improve facility energy efficiency and to have a positive environmental impact, a regenerative ac\/dc load bank is proposed to push power from generator testing back to the electric grid. The proposed generator power recapture unit (GPRU) will load the generators according to their respective test procedures by emulating resistive and inductive loads.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A novel hybrid acoustic emission (AE) and guided wave (GW) inspection approach for the inspection of radar towers is presented in this proposal. Many radar sites are over 50 years old and it is important to keep them in good repair, as they are a critical intelligence component that provides advanced aircraft notification. It is proposed to supplement the passive AE inspection method with active GW inspection. AE events can provide a trigger for immediate GW nondestructive testing, allowing inspection redundancy and significantly improved damage classification. Active GW inspection is highly effective at locating and sizing damage (i.e., cracks, corrosion), and is currently used in the pipeline industry to reliably inspect up to 600 feet from a single location. Additionally, the use of GW sensors sensitive to shear horizontal type waves can provide several benefits over traditional AE sensors, including: simpler, more efficient, and more robust source localization, increased sensitivity to certain types of crack growth, and decreased sensitivity to environmental noise. A hybrid AE-GW inspection technology has the potential to revolutionize the traditional AE market. This proposal describes how this technology can be developed and adapted to address the monitoring and inspection needs of existing and future radar towers.; BENEFIT: As a result of the proposed work, a novel hybrid acoustic emission (AE) and guided wave (GW) inspection method will be born. The integration of active GW inspection will increase damage sizing and characterization capability. The use of special shear-type sensors will increase detectability and reliability of AE systems. Increased sensitivity to damage and damage characterization capability will result in a more complete understanding of a structures current damage stage and the rate of damage progression. This will allow for improved scheduling and advanced notice for maintenance operations, reducing the time and cost devoted to maintenance. In some cases, damage not detected using the traditional AE method may be detected using the hybrid AE-GW method. Due to these reasons, the AE-GW method has the potential to revolutionize the traditional AE market. After application of the AE-GW inspection method to radar towers, the sensors, techniques, and analysis algorithms developed herein will be quickly adapted for commercialization and implementation onto many other structures typically inspected using the traditional AE method."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Many of the radar sites throughout the world are over 50 years old and ongoing sustainment and inspections of these facilities is in critical need. We propose to develop and test a wireless, multi-channel and low power consumption Acoustic Emission (AE) sensor network system to monitor the steel and composite radar tower structures for fatigue and stress corrosion cracking. The proposed system leverages our extensive structural monitoring experience for steel highway bridges. The AE sensor system will be able to detect and discern damage sound from the environmental noise, and localize the damage site within a few inches with a sparse sensor network. Phase I will focus on developing and testing the feasibility of the AE sensor network for representative structures with cyclic fatigue tests in the lab, and field trials of the prototype device on a target radar tower; Phase II will further develop and improve the system and deploy the system on the radar tower for long term data collection in the operational environment. The end-product will also be ready to transition to real radar system applications for other civil infrastructures.; BENEFIT: AE-WSN has significant commercial potential for applications in both military and civil structure integrity monitoring and maintenance. Without knowledge of damage condition, radar tower in service need to be inspected based on a fixed schedule. Large safety factors are usually applied which significantly increases maintenance cost. On the other extreme, as some of the radar towers are located in extremely remote and desolate locations, inspections of those towers may be skipped over some extended period of time, leading to potential severe structural failures. The proposed tool provides accurate and reliable assessment of damage status and fatigue life. Condition-based maintenance can be performed, which greatly reduces costs and labors. Both government and commercial organizations will benefit from the development of AE-WSN system."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Casting parts with intricate internal surfaces are routinely used in many gun systems. It is important to inspect those casting parts to ensure the inner structures comply with the original design during the first article testing and production lot certification. Currently, inspections of inner surfaces are often done with borescopes, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and costly. Additionally, a structure may contain holes that are too small for the probes to fit in, thus making it virtually impossible to examine those parts using borescopes. Over the past decade, there have been abundant research activities gearing towards the development of a scanner for 3D point cloud generation. However, theoe 3D scanners are mainly used to reveal the surface features. In this proposal, AlphaSense, Inc. details the development of a novel, high precision, X-ray 3D scanner for non-line-of-sight point cloud generation. If successful, the merits of the proposed 3D scanner include the following: a) Capable of interrogating complex inner structures, b) High measurement throughput, c) High spatial resolution, d) Large inspection volume, and e) Easy and fully automatic defect detection process.; BENEFIT: The outcome of this research is coupled to a very clear commercialization path. The proposed X-ray 3D scanner can be used for both military and civilian applications. The most straightforward military application of the proposed scanner is to reconstruct the complex inner surfaces of various castings used in gun systems for quality inspection and assurance. The proposed sensor can be used by the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of gun components to quickly assess the quality of casting parts during the first article testing or production lot testing. Consequently, the deployment of the sensor in the manufacturing environment can help dramatically shorten the lead time of casting parts and minimize the risk associate with defective parts. For commercial applications, it can be used to non-destructively evaluate the structural integrity of various casting parts used in different market sectors, including automobile, heavy machinery, aerospace and petroleum industries where casting components are widely used. The proposed X-ray 3D scanner may also find applications in the quick prototyping and reverse engineering field"

        "abstract": "ALAE proposes to develop a reconfigurable test adapter (RTA) that adapts differences between existing automated test systems (ATS) \/ Automated Test Equipment (ATE) to ensure efficient, cost-effective test program sets (TPS) transportability. Wiring from core versatile depot automated test station (VDATS) instrumentation (oscilloscopes, signal generators, counters, power supplies, etc.) will be routed to the RTA. Various standard unit under test (UUT) interfaces will be explored and selected based on the emulated legacy tester and best practices for preservation of signal integrity. Identification of potential hardware differences (capability and configuration) between the re-host target and the VDATS will be analyzed using automatic test markup language (ATML) TPS descriptors such as Test Description, Instrument Description, Test Configuration, Test Adapter Description, and Test Station Description (IEEE 1671.1,2, 4-6). Capabilities not covered by VDATS will be identified and provided by the RTA using synthetic \/ virtual instruments and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) instruments. Both will be coordinated with VDATS through platform independent RTA middleware software using a standard bus protocol (i.e. PXI, LXI, GPIB, etc.) and a common application programming interface (API) allowing for additional instrument(s) to be controlled by the re-hosted TPS."

In other words, antenna testing takes a long time to acquire the required multi-dimensional data sets and interdependent antenna measurement system design makes upgrades expensive and disruptive.GTI will evaluate three Air Force antenna test facilities to determine how to best apply their latest simultaneous measurements technology concepts to reduce test times by an order of magnitude or more. GTI will then apply their rigorous systems engineering process to turn these technologies into a robust, modular and extensible antenna test system design that will increase the capability, capacity, reliability and sustainability for these Air Force antenna ranges. GTIs modular design approach using robust interfaces will enable future range upgrades with minimal disruption. Key aspects of this transformational test system technology will be demonstrated.; BENEFIT: This research will advance the state of the art in antenna test by developing a system to define modular and extensible antenna test facilities in terms of interfaces and functionality, and to advance simultaneous measurements technology. These concepts can be applied to systematically update other government and commercial antenna test ranges. Alternate markets for the developed technologies include satellite ground stations."

Fatigue life reduction due to surface finish and microstructure changes caused by exposure to environments and chemicals during processing must be researched and K factors associated with specific material\/process combinations must be determined. During Phase I performance, SES will develop K factors, based on a proven statistical methodology. These K factors will then be used to accurately debit strain-life curves which are needed for landing gear fatigue models to ensure the safety of the aircraft fleet as it continues in heavy use far past its originally intended design life. Knowledge of how various processes affect fatigue life will also aid in selecting processes that have the least influence on fatigue."

Because of the importance of identifying the part families in the design of an RMS system, we propose a systematic approach in identifying part families with respect to aircraft maintenance procedures, and connecting each part family to the maintenance procedure and required resources. The objective is to develop a systematic model to represent the aircraft maintenance system, including critical aircraft products (major system, subsystem, and components), maintenance procedures, machines required for each procedure, and sequences and cycle time needed. The model will be used to represent the aircraft maintenance system, to identify the opportunities to implement the RMS, and to evaluate the improvements and effectiveness of an RMS strategy if it is implemented."

Due to the diversity of testing requirements met by their facility, they have a need for a portable near-field antenna measurement system that can operate in various modes over a large range of frequencies, and be effective in measuring antenna characteristics in the presence of the electrically large platforms on which the antennas are mounted.MI Technologies proposes to address this need with a novel combination of technologies including robotic positioning of photonic near-field probes and laser tracking technology to enable multiple scan planes to be combined into a single near-field scan for far-field transformation. This unique combination of technologies is expected to yield a flexible, light-weight, broadband, near-field solution that will operate in the presence of extremely large platforms.; BENEFIT: Advantages of the technologies to be investigated would offer significant value to MI&apos;s customers and would be of benefit to the antenna test and measurement community at large. Development of portable and accurate near-field antenna measurement products will help a wide range of military, automotive and spacecraft antennas to be characterized in-situ. MI plans to leverage the experience gained through this SBIR to develop options to its existing product line thereby realizing the advantages described above for its customers.This research could lead to new abilities to use robotic positioners in numerous measurement applications where traditional robotics are limited in available scan area."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To deter birds from colliding with solar panels and other reflective surfaces, InnoSense LLC (ISL) will develop mosaic reflective surfaces based on holographic optical elements (MOSAIC-HOE). MOSAIC-HOE will diffuse the light reflected from windows and\/or solar photovoltaic panels to deter bird collision. This surface will consist of multiplexed HOEs that control polarization and surface color at every angle of incidence. Light becomes polarized when it reflects off a smooth, dark surface. To approaching birds, this polarized light signifies a body of water. With MOSAIC-HOE, birds will no longer see a safe smooth surface. A narrowband wide angle HOE will allow a large portion of beneficial wavelengths to be transmitted through the HOE to the solar cell as required. In Phase I, ISL will demonstrate feasibility experimentally and also perform theoretical analysis and computer simulation. In Phase II ISL will develop a prototype comprising multiplexed Bragg HOEs for Air Force testing.; BENEFIT: The MOSAIC-HOE coating is commercially attractive because of its use of low-cost materials and fabrication techniques, and its compatibility with state-of-the-art solar panel technology. Since holographic photopolymers are processed with laser and UV light and heating, holographic filters are far more environmentally stable and rugged than multilayer thin film coatings. These coatings can be adapted to a variety of reflective surfaces, including military and commercial buildings, solar power facilities, and turbines."

The EPIC stability code solving the nonlinear parabolized stability equations (NPSE) will be coupled to mean flow solutions and receptivity models relating tunnel noise to initial 2nd mode amplitudes and frequencies for the initial conditions for EPIC NPSE marching.The 2nd mode saturation amplitudes will be computed by EPIC or a breakdown amplitude correlation will be applied in Macks amplitude method.The algorithms will include the use of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to provide physics-based receptivity models applicable to both wind tunnels and flight. In Phase II the algorithm will be implemented and validated.Crossflow instability and transient growth will be computed and the length of the transition region will be predicted."

        "abstract": "A comprehensive framework for hypersonic boundary layer transition predictions applicable to wind tunnel and free flight conditions is proposed. The distinguishing feature of this transition prediction framework is that it is developed from the ground up allowing full integration of the important transition regions (receptivity region, linear\/secondary\/nonlinear stability regimes, etc.) and additional aspects that affect the transition process (e.g. free-stream turbulence and acoustic disturbances). This development does not target incremental improvements in current state-of-the-art prediction tools (e.g LST, PSE\/NPSE, etc.) but it addresses the transition process as a whole in a fully integrated way. The important transition regions are coupled through a closed optimization loop that is used to determine the extent of the transition region based on available input free-stream turbulence levels and acoustic power spectra. The predictions for each regime will be validated against existing and newly generated DNS databases and experimental data. A key advantage of this approach is that it is not limited to simple geometries. The approach is applicable to complex geometries relevant for applications of our industry partner Raytheon Missile Systems (Tucson, AZ). This framework will be able to assist product development in early design cycles and bears the potential for enabling innovative designs."

        "abstract": "For a vehicle in hypersonic flight, the natural transition of a boundary layer from laminar to turbulent flow depends on multiple factors including the free-stream conditions, the noise level and frequency spectrum of free-stream disturbances, the geometry of the vehicle and the vehicle surface properties.To predict boundary layer transition for flow over a given vehicle, one or more of these factors need to be investigated.In this SBIR Phase I effort, our team will develop computational tools and methodologies for the prediction of boundary-layer transition in experimental facilities and methods for extrapolation of predictions to flight conditions.Our team proposes a framework using a hierarchy of analysis methods including linear stability theory, parabolized stability equations, and global stability analysis, anchored by the results of direct numerical simulation and experimental data, to analyze hypersonic boundary layer stability to determine whether transition for a given vehicle of interest is likely due to one or more possible mechanisms.When appropriate, analysis methods will use physical models relevant to high-enthalpy, chemically-reacting flows.The resulting methods will fit into into a framework which will assist a researcher, designer, or engineer with method selection and execution, results visualization, and data interpretation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The main objective of this SBIR Phase I proposal is three-fold: to design an innovativecomputational technology based on parametric, linearized and nonlinear aeroelastic\/aeroservoelastic Reduced-Order Models (ROMs); to develop its core components; and to verify and validate them. The overall technical approach will be based on the state-of-the-art of Projection based Model Order Reduction (PMOR) methodology. Specifically, adaptive and non-adaptive greedy algorithms will be developed for sampling the parameter domain. For linearized problems, the PMOR methodology will be based on the concept of a database of point-wise ROMs and its associated real-time algorithms for interpolation on matrix manifolds. For nonlinear ROMs, it will be based on the concept of global ROMs with local reduced-order bases and equipped with a structure-preserving hyperreduction procedure. To account for model and parametric uncertainties and any other sources of error, ROMadaptation will be performed based on test data using a novel nonparametric probabilistic approach. The proposed computational technology will be operable as: a predictive tool to estimate aeroelastic\/aeroservoelastic stability and aerodynamic loads prior to testing; a real-time system that takes inputs from a given live flight test and outputs a corresponding estimate of the aeroelastic\/aeroservoelastic stability and aerodynamic loads; a pilot-in-the-loopaeroservoelastic\/aeroelastic simulator.; BENEFIT: The end product of this SBIR effort will be a computational technology for the reduction of parameterized, linear and nonlinear, high-dimensional, aeroelastic --- that is, fluid-structure --- computational models based on the coupling of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) representations of fluid and structural systems, respectively, in view of enabling parameterized aeroelastic analyses in real time. For a flight test center, it will enable the online estimation of aeroelastic\/aeroservoelastic stability and aerodynamic loads prior to testing, and therefore improve the efficiency of flight testing. It will also enable the predictive simulation of &quot;as flown&quot; rather than &quot;as planned&quot; sorties, which will minimize the sources of error in flight testing and reduce the number of needed test points. It will be also operable as a pilot-in-the-loop aeroservoelastic\/aeroelastic simulator: therefore, it will upgrade existing flight simulators with flexibility effects and provide a broader base for educating and training both discipline engineers and Test Pilot School students. The benefits of this anticipated end product will also extend to the aeronautics industry at large. Indeed, because it will enable real-time predictive aeroelastic analyses, this product will pave the way for introducing aeroelasticity into the design process at an earlier stage than currently done, thereby contributing to bridging the gap between analysis and design.More importantly, the market for the end product of this SBIR effort will be much larger than that of flight test centers and the aeronautics industry. Indeed, there is a pressing need today for predictive, CFD-CSD simulations for the solution of many important engineering problems. These include, to name only a few: the aerodynamic rehabilitation of suspension bridges where finding a way to avoid repeating the cycle of deterioration and crash repairs continues to challenge civil engineers; the aeroelastic tailoring of front and rear wings of Formula 1 and other race cars; the control of flow-induced noise in various military and commercial systems; and the design and test support of biomedical micro devices for drug delivery. Just like the design and test support of high-performance aircraft (where flutter, LCO, and buffeting remain among the most important considerations) are mission critical for the military and many commercial aerospace companies, these problems and applications are of significant concern to the high-end civil and marine engineering companies, automotive industry (automobile, train, ...), and an important segment of the emerging bioengineering industry such as that focusing on diagnostics in cardiology. Unfortunately, in all of these areas, high-fidelity CFD-CSD simulations remain so computationally intensive that they cannot be performed as often as needed, are more often performed in special circumstances than routinely, and are avoided for time-critical applications. However, because it will enable the construction of parametric CFD-CSD Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) that are operable in real time, the end product of this SBIR software will change this situation. Because its underlying technology for constructing such ROMs will be based on technologies for constructing individual CFD and CSD ROMs and coupling them, it will be a game changer not only for coupled CFD-CSD, but also CFD and CSD. For all these reasons, it will disrupt the markets of all of CFD, CSD, and CFD-CSD."

The F\/A-18 Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW) aircraft will be used as the test case to investigate and validate the proposed methods.The background flow solutions under various Mach number and angle-of-attack grid points are first obtained by the FUN3D NS solver, thereafter the generalized aerodynamic forces around such nonlinear background flow at various frequencies are obtained by ZULUS using the linearized Euler solver. The computed aerodynamic solutions related to rigid-body modes will be corrected by flight-test or wind-tunnel derived data using the Lagrange multiplier technique. The three methods of achieving the parameterized ROM will be evaluated and compared to one another and conclusions and recommendations will be drawn upon based on the results. The Phase I effort will pave the way for the final integration of ROMs into the DFS framework for flight simulation and prediction.; BENEFIT: The DFS system, once developed, can be utilized for a number of purposes, including control law development, maneuvering flight simulations, flutter simulations and testing, flight loads testing, and handling quality assessments.A uniformed aeroelastic Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) technique across various flight conditions serves as the key component of the DFS framework which can rapidly solve the flight dynamic equations of motion with flexible effects in real-time.This technology has the potential of providing more accurate dynamic flight simulations for better situational awareness, system understanding for aircraft systems under test as well as being a useful tool for training engineers and test pilots."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: FIRST RF Corporation of Boulder, CO, and IMSAR LLC of Springville, UT, propose the development of an ultra-low-SWaP micro-SAR (uSAR) system that operates in the military radar Ka and W-Bands.This radar will be extremely lightweight and low-volume, lending itself to integration on a variety of Air Force aircraft and weapons platforms, enhancing the situational awareness, survivability, and overall effectiveness of the same.Initially, the uSAR system will be integrated onto Boeings Scan Eagle UAS platform, which achieves extremely high levels of persistence at low operational costs.FIRST RF Corporation and IMSAR, LLC bring a near-optimal mix of core competencies to this SBIR topic solicitation.IMSAR has developed the worlds smallest operational SAR sensor, the NanoSAR, which has fielded on the Shadow UAS and has already been demonstrated on the target platform.FIRST RF, as the primary developer of the Ka- and W-Band front-end modules for the program, leverages its extensive history developing hardware at mmW frequencies for government customers.; BENEFIT: Security concerns across the global landscape reinforce the need for continuous awareness of ones environment. A capability that can provide intelligence imagery anytime - in any type of weather - is critical to enhancing situational awareness and gaining a tactical edge. That capability is Synthetic Aperture Radar, or SAR.Synthetic aperture radar, first invented in 1951, is a remarkable airborne radar paradigm that leverages modern signal processing hardware and techniques to achieve extremely high imaging performance when paired with highly capable antenna technologies.SAR has become a mainstay technology in the USAF and other governmental systems.The miniaturization of this ubiquitous radar technique, coupled with the meteoric rise in popularity of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), promises as-yet unrealized levels of sensor capability, effectiveness, and autonomy."

MicroXact Inc. proposes to develop a compact, portable, easily maintainable and upgradable by end user closed cycle refrigerator (CCR)-based FTS that will provide DoD, NASA and commercial users with a practical and cost effective solution. The key feature of the proposed cryo-vacuum FTS compared to competing approaches is the thermal conductivity management approach transferred from MicroXact cryogenic probe station technology, that reduces the thermal mass of the components to be cooled to below 30K, enabling the use of commercial-of-the-shelf CCRs , and tremendously reducing the cool-down time. In Phase I MicroXact will design the cryo-vacuum FTS and numerically demonstrate that it meets program objectives. In Phase II the prototype of cryo-vacuum FTS will be developed, tested at MicroXact and delivered to AFTC Arnold for qualification and testing. In Phase III MicroXact will transition the technology to manufacturing and will commercialize the cryo FTS."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Holloman MagLev Track (HMT) located at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, is the premier test facility for applications requiring a low vibration environment, while simultaneously experiencing velocities ranging from sub-sonic to supersonic speeds. The Maglev program began in the mid-nineties as an upgrade to the High Speed Test Track, which previously involved high vibration mechanical steel-on-steel rails. The magnetic systems primary mission is to provide a low vibration magnetic levitation\/ suspension to the sled throughout a test flight. High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnet system offer the potential to significantly reduce the cost, complexity, and operational logistics of the cryogenic system as well as possible improvement to the electromagnetic (E-M) performance of the system through significantly higher magnetic field strength. E2P proposes a much simplified, lighter weight MagLev system utilizing higher performing superconducting coils. E2Ps proprietary system would eliminate the need for any liquid cryogens to be transported on the rocket sled during it flight, allow for multiple flights per day, subsequently significantly simplify flight logistics and operations.; BENEFIT: One of the most promising features of the Phase I\/Phase II proposal is the potential for future commercialization of the technology developed under this SBIR topic. The 2G YBCO magnet technology developed under this topic is directly applicable to aerospace applications current being developed at Boeing. One such area actively being pursued by Boeing is an Electromagnetic Transducer (EMT) system.Boeings HTS based EMT system will be used as a non-destructive, non-invasive aerospace inspection system greatly enhancing capability of conventional non-superconducting systems.The Boeing Company has committed to the pursuit of this commercialization effort in Phase II if funded (see letter of support)."

Salient aspects of the proposed solution are: (1) image compression and data-driven surrogate modeling operate in concert to capture the effects of various parameters (Mach number, angle of attack, altitude, etc.) on plume characteristics; (2) image compression, interpolation, and morphing\/modification are fully coupled and performed concurrently in compressed images; (3) utilization of global statistical patterns across hyperspectral image sets, well-suited for database with sparsely placed nodes; and (4) a modular software environment to facilitate seamless integration into USAF-designated framework for sensors development and HWIL testing. In Phase I, key components, including a hyperspectral image compression module, a surrogate modeling module, a verification module, and an integrated software environment will be developed. Feasibility will be demonstrated via multiple case studies of USAF interest, in which synthetic and hyperspectral image sets at various flight parameters will be analyzed, and software performance (e.g., accuracy, speed, resource, and integrability) will be assessed. The Phase II effort will focus on capability extension, algorithm optimization, software integration, and extensive software validation and demonstration."

It will also use the resulting data to create probability of kill tables for vulnerability analyses.The finished tool will accommodate damage from any combination of impact, blast, Hydrodynamic Ram (HRAM), fragmentation, and thermal (fire, directed energy, laser, etc.) damage mechanisms.; BENEFIT: While this technology will be beneficial for a wide variety of military applications in any of the services, it is equally if not more relevant to commercial interests, such as infrastructure and buildings, aircraft, marine craft, and space vehicles.Many bridges and buildings can be represented with this technology and would benefit from vulnerability modeling to simulate damage from storms, terrorism, or even car crashes.Commercial aircraft are also subject to a variety of damage for which vulnerability modeling would be an appropriate precaution, including uncontained engine failure, mid-air impacts with unmanned aerial vehicles, and terrorism.Commercial marine craft have similar issues with terrorism or collisions. Any number of applications exist in the realm of commercial space flight from launch damage to impacts with various scale of debris while in orbit to otherwise uninteresting damage that is exacerbated by the unique thermal environment presented in space."

The proposed EDAptive RIVAL solution builds on previous Edaptive Computing, Inc. (ECI) knowledge and technology. The resulting capabilities will provide an innovative simplified validation system that tests any data recorder for compliance to IRIG standards. ECIs capabilities and expertise are ideally-suited to applying open-source software and commercially available hardware solutions and is key to achieving the objective of increasing the interoperability of IRIG compliant devices.The IRIG instrumentation data format is complex and has been updated many times. IRIGs complexity requires validation for accurate conformance to the specification to insure reliable data interchange amongst range instrumentation. We will provide for the validation of any IRIG recording device or memory module using standard hardware and open-source software, using plug-in hardware compatibility to permit device interoperability and modular software design to accommodate hardware and software upgrades. This will be delivered on a mobile platform whose use is simple to master via an intuitive interface.; BENEFIT: The result of our effort is to provide a solution to the issue of IRIG 106, Chapter 10 validation and to provide hardware compatibility with all required devices. Through the use of our technology it will be possible to verify that devices of different types and interfaces are interoperable and are consistent in their support of the IRIG standard. By providing a portable and easy to use device, we can facilitate field testing of all types of devices under many different environmental conditions. Ease of use, being an important goal of our UI development, will allow for easy training and a high degree of confidence in the results produced.Considering the pervasiveness of IRIGs use on range instrumentation (as well as other related devices) there should be significant commercial follow on in supporting new hardware interfaces as well as support for changes to the IRIG standard. The development process will closely adhere to best practices for modularity and extensibility, to allow for a very natural and straightforward path to upgrades for both hardware and software capabilities."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address this Air Force need for high-accuracy active optical fiber metrology, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new High-Precision Optical Fiber Inspection (HIPROOF) system based on a novel type of X-ray inspection of the fiber structure, which provides information on the dopant concentration and refractive index distribution. Specifically, the innovation in the X-ray imaging technique and data analysis algorithms will enable the HIPROOF system to measure the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of ytterbium and thulium in a fiber with accuracy of 0.1 wt.%, and determine the refractive index profile with accuracy of 10^-4, which directly address the Air Force metrology requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the HIPROOF system by designing, fabricating, and testing a prototype system reaching technology readiness level (TRL)-4. In Phase II, POC plans to build a functional TRL-5\/-6 HIPROOF system capable of performing high-accuracy active fiber metrology, in accordance with the Air Force performance specifications, and deliver the final system to the Air Force.; BENEFIT: Target Military\/Government Applications. The Phase III HIPROOF will be a high-precision, versatile, and reliable optical fiber metrology system, capable of inspecting large mode area (LMA) fibers with arbitrary geometry. The system will provide chemical and optical characterization of the fiber properties required for efficient beam combining in high-power laser arrays. Due to its compact size and the simplicity of the interface, the HIPROOF will enjoy straightforward integration into the current and future Air Force high-power fiber R&amp;D efforts.Target Commercial Applications: HIPROOF-derived systems, based on the multispectral X-ray computed tomography (MSXCT) approach, can be used for comprehensive nondestructive evaluation\/testing (NDE\/NDT) of optical fibers and other microstructures, in applications where not only high-resolution dimensional measurements, but also the knowledge of chemical composition and optical properties are important."

In particular, the phase I effort will illustrate with a particular pre-filtering algorithm (and associated software) that we can mitigate the effects of speckle, scintillation, and sensor noise in the active tracker. Moreover, we will indicate how we can potentially commercialize the technology for both military and commercial applications, although active tracking generally requires permission from the illuminated target owner. So commercialization would require cooperative actively tracked systems."

However, as the laser propagates to and from the target, atmospheric turbulence and deconstructive coherent interference of the lasers highly coherent light result in undesirable image artifacts that disrupt image processing algorithms. As slant angle decreases (especially near the ground), distance to target increases, or aperture size decreases (as is the case for smaller drone based systems), the image plane artifacts become worse. SA Photonics proposes the development of the FLASH-Lite laser illuminator and the FLASH-Lite system to solve the issue of speckle and scintillation in laser illuminated imaging.; BENEFIT: SA Photonics&apos; FLASH-Lite illuminator contains proprietary technology to mitigate speckle and scintillation in laser illumination imaging applications. SA Photonics&apos; technologies can enable enhanced tracking and resolving capability, while also enabling system architectures using smaller Rx and Tx apertures allowing use on smaller UAVs."

In this technique, the input pulse is passed through M birefringent crystals or beam splitters to produce 2M copies, and thereby decrease the individual-pulse peak power by the same factor. The individual amplified pulses are recombined after the amplifier to create a pulse with high peak power.DPA was employed to demonstrate the first fiber amplifier to generate transform-limited pulses with megawatt peak power.; BENEFIT: There are a variety of scientific markets for this technology, and most of these market segments require the generation of ultraviolet or deep ultraviolet light.KMLabs holds significant IP for the generation of low wavelength light with an ultrafast laser, and the laser enabled by this proposal would perform well in these wavelength-conversion applications because of the high pulse energy and short pulse duration ("

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Personnel Recovery plays a very critical role in the success of military missions for both humanitarian and strategic reasons. Maintaining highly trained Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) teams is of critical importance to the Air Force. Cost efficiency considerations demand the development of training solutions that provide high efficacy at lower costs. Game-based trainers have the potential to meet this demand. This proposal addresses the challenge of developing pedagogically sound and modular game-based trainers that can run on desktop or mobile computers and replicate the effectiveness of instructor-led training. We propose to develop a game-based system called Stratagems for training combat rescue helicopter aircrew. The modular design of Stratagems will enable the rapid customization of the trainer for different roles and skills. The trainer will provide automated feedback and coaching, including an augmented form of ShadowBox, a proven coaching technique that enables trainees to get an insight into and learn the decision-making processes and reasoning of experts. This will make Stratagems suitable for a variety of use cases such as classroom-based training, self-paced training, or just-in-time mission rehearsals. Phase I will result in detailed system design and the development of a limited, proof-of-concept prototype.; BENEFIT: This proposal fits in very well with the business plan for our organization. Game-based training has already established a foothold in the training market. This proposal allows us to offer an innovative advancement by incorporating the ShadowBox coaching approach to game-based training. Stottler Henke and ShadowBox LLC will be in a position to jointly market this technology to the commercial training sector. The approach is generalizable to many domains and could be particularly useful for training social skills such as customer service. It would also be greatly valuable to training civilians providing critical services such as law enforcement and emergency response. Training in search and rescue operations also has applicability in the civilian world, albeit the constraints and conditions faced by such operations are different.Even as Phase II proceeds, we will demonstrate the training systems to our contacts and to key decision makers in the Navy and the Army. Additionally, we have partnered in the past with large businesses such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. We will demonstrate the technologies to our contacts within these organizations. We will continue to involve them during Phase II with the goal of providing them the resulting tools and technologies at the end of the effort."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The purpose of the SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate an aircrew simulator\/game that allows training in a high-fidelity environment, complete with configurable and reportable performance metrics and data gathering. The solution will need to include the ability for trainers to design and distribute scenario and training material with turn-key efficiency.Progeny Systems will develop a training exemplar after researching the most qualified game engine appropriate for the source material based on an established rubric. This training exemplar will demonstrate the simulator itself, the scenario designer for use by training instructors, and the database for collection and reporting of desired performance metrics.; BENEFIT: The Phase 1 effort is aimed at researching the appropriate game engine technology to power the simulator, as well as development of a scenario designer to be used in conjunction with the game engine. This will lead into the development of a training exemplar\/prototype to be delivered at the end of the Phase 1 effort.The initial effort during Phase 1 will be the evaluation and selection of a capable game engine to power the simulator itself. This evaluation will be performed using a specialized rubric to ensure that the engine meets every possible need of the final simulator.Alongside the research effort for the game engine, a scenario designer will be developed with the end-user in mind. This scenario designer will be powerful and capable, but should require no special training for the end-user, presenting an easy-to-use interface capable of generating scenarios and scenario packages. Questions asked directly to the TPOC and SMEs during Phase 1 will provide the information needed to ensure that the selections within the scenario designer are accurate and reflect real-world usage.A server database will then be defined and configured to accept, store, and report on configurable performance metrics generated by actions completed in the game simulator. This database will be capable of storing metrics and reporting on individual performance records and analysis of emerging trends within users of the simulator. Questions asked directly to the TPOC and SMEs will help define which performance metrics should be initially included for tracking.For Phase 1, physical control schemes for the prototype will be limited to traditional keyboard\/mouse and gamepad support, with possible expansion for control capability in Phase II.This Phase I work will result in a fully working exemplar prototype which provides a solution to the initial problem presented by the Air Force. A prototype\/Version 1.0 of the Scenario Editor will be provided with the ability to generate separate scenarios. These scenarios will feed into the game engine executable, loading in specific configuration items that will directly influence the scenario that plays out. Completing or failing any scenario will generate reportable metrics, stored in a database for future reporting and incorporation into trend analysis.Phase II work will likely branch out into more complex and configurable scenarios and scenario packages, along with updated control schemes for the game end-user. These control schemes will likely include efforts in the Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality game space, which will allow for even higher fidelity and significant realism within the game world itself."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Design Knowledge Companys (TDKCs) proposed WHTS Airman Navigation and Direction EstimatoR (WANDER) is a technique that combines innovative image feature selection, registration, tracking, and helmet position and angle calculation processes to provide accurate battlefield airman (BA) helmet orientation in geospatial coordinates.WANDER includes four principal components: (1) a helmet-mounted camera, (2) a Helmet Angle Calculator that includes Object Locator, Offset Detector, and Angle Estimator functions; and (3) a Position\/Orientation Analyzer and Calculator that produces accurate, absolute helmet position and angular orientation in geospatial coordinates.The TDKC team is well-qualified to perform this research due to our related helmet tracking experience, success with similar development projects, and proven expertise with sensing, video\/image processing, image registration, and real-time computing technologies.During Phase I, we will build, test, and demonstrate a WANDER Feasibility Testbedan early functional prototype to experimentally and analytically assess feasibility and to verify and demonstrate our feasibility conclusions to the Air Force.We will also produce a preliminary design that includes size, weight, and power (SWaP) assessment and an architecture and plan for integration into a BAO kit for testing in Phase II.Our Phase I effort will also produce an initial commercialization assessment.; BENEFIT: WANDER integrates innovative image processing and other sensing technologies to provide accurate battlefield airman (BA) helmet tracking at real-time video speed, using TDKCs existing and proven image registration technique, the Simple Topographical Area Registration Engine or STARE, and an automatic feature selection technique to assist the registration.WANDER provides this helmet tracking in a small-volume, transportable package with no setup or calibration requirements, and autonomous operation. WANDER offers cost-effective and accurate helmet tracking and geospatial positioning advantages to numerous government or military organizations that need to track helmets (or other objects) in real-time with high accuracy. Commercial applications are significant, predominantly in the gaming and security domains, as well self-orienting robots, drones or UAVsanywhere a camera can be mounted.WANDER is a lower-cost, higher-speed alternative to tracking vehicle, personnel, or object motion and geolocation in general, which may occur in numerous reconnaissance, surveillance, or other missions."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Air Force is seeking a wearable head-tracker system for use with dismounted operators digital vision devices to enable symbol placement conformal to the real world without perceptible lag or artifacts. In response, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Enhanced Day\/Night Dismounted Soldier Head Tracker (ENSiHT) system based on the unique integration of state-of-the-art and proven day-time head tracker with a set of new enabling glue logic (including hardware and algorithms) to greatly improve and tailor the head tracker to be operated in night and GPS-denied environments. The innovation in implementing compatible glue logic enables the uses of digital night-vision devices and additional navigation sensors for new operation capabilities that achieve low latency, low jitter, and high accuracy. In Phase I, POC will design the ENSiHT system meeting size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements; estimate latency, accuracy, and jitter; fit the ENSiHT system with the dismounted Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) Kit, and develop a system implementation plan for evaluation in combat environments. In Phase II, we plan to fabricate an ENSiHT prototype system, develop a test plan, optimize its SWaP performance, reliability, and ruggedization, and develop a roadmap for technology transitions.; BENEFIT: ENSiHT will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive wearable head-tracker system that can be used in GPS-denied environments day or night, to improve visualization accuracy and symbol representation for heads-up and head-mounted display technologies. Military applications of the ENSiHT technology include the BAO Kit, navigation in GPS-denied operations including vehicles, UAVs, and dismounted operators. Gaming, simulation and training, and commercial aviation via future HMDs (including augmented and virtual realities) are the many commercial applications that we envision that can be derived from the ENSiHT technology. ENSiHT can be used in logistics and shipping in order to provide safety or instructions for detailed operations or repairs and maintenance. ENSiHT can be used to enrich heads-up and head-mounted visualization for sports and outdoor activities, team coordination for emergency response, and individual team member and milestone location display. For training, ENSiHT can enrich virtual scenarios by bringing virtual agents to life, making training more immersive."

Through this assessment, Silverthread may be able to forecast cost, waste, schedule, etc., more specifically identify quality challenges, and make recommendations that will improve the ROI of software systems investments in maintenance, re-write, and refactoring.; BENEFIT: - Improve success rate of IT investment decisions regarding re-writing or re-factoring software systems- Improve the ability to assess quality of a software system and manage future costs, schedules, and responsiveness- Improve the ability to assess the quality of a third party contractor- Improve the ability to assess and understand the relative quality of a software system against an internal or external benchmark."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The architectural complexity of a software code base has a significant impact on its operability, maintainability, and extensibility. In general, as the complexity increases, so do the number of bugs, the amount of time required to fix each bug, and the amount of time required to adjust existing features or add new features to the software. We propose to build the Case Based Reasoning System for Software Architecture Evaluation and Insight (CBR Insight), to provide contracting officials with a tool they can use to measure and understand the ramifications of architectural complexity.CBR Insight will combine the functionality of a leading COTS static analysis tool with case based reasoning techniques from artificial intelligence and leverage existing visualization and automation software. The result is a tool capable of generating the propagation cost and core size metrics and fully leveraging these results to provide insight into operational performance, risks, and costs.During Phase I we will develop use cases and requirements, design the CBR Insight system, build a limited prototype, evaluate the prototype on open-source DOD projects, gather feedback, and develop a plan for Phase II.; BENEFIT: The most direct targets for marketing the results of this effort are contracting officials and others involved in government and commercial software acquisition. CBR Insight would be especially attractive to this market given that it is an analysis tool designed for non-developers. By demonstrating significant results in evaluating and understanding the ramifications of software architectural complexity in Phase II, CBR Insight will provide the US Air Force with a strong incentive to fund the Phase III deployment of the proposed system.A secondary target of this effort is to market CBR Insight as an extension to the existing COTS code analysis tool that CBR Insight will be integrated with. CBR Insight would provide powerful new capabilities that would be of interest to current and new software developers utilizing their system. Additionally, any development team being evaluated on these architectural complexity metrics would need to put tools in place to monitor metric scores throughout the development process."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Shortcomings, including high costs and lack of realism, associated with classical approaches in aircrew training have motivated the desire to develop a virtual aerial refueling training environment.Such an environment has the potential to provide a cost-effective, realistic environment to perform repetition training.A vital facet of such a training tool is the development of a realistic aircraft aerodynamics model for tanker aircraft, drogue, and receiver aircraft.Accurately modeling the aerodynamics of these components is a necessary first step toward a successful simulation environment.As a step toward enhancing the aircrew training simulations Corvid Innovation proposes a unique, innovative, and simple toolset for building aircraft aerodynamics models.Leveraging well established practices at Corvid, high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics, in-house HPC systems, and in-house aerodynamic model development tools Corvid will provide an incremental advance in our current methodologies that will enable the proper characterization of a receiver aircraft in the presence of a tanker wake.Tanker aerodynamics and wake generation will also be demonstrated along with drogue response.These aeromodels will be demonstrated through the use of fast-running simulation tools which will serve as a first step in the development of a simulation environment for aircrew training.; BENEFIT: There are a number of paths for commercializing a high-fidelity, fast-running, capability for predicting aircraft response in a dynamic flowfield.The most notable include:1. Formation Flight2. Aerial UAV Refueling (private sector)3. Small UAV Refueling4. Small UAV Gust Response5. Enhanced Aircraft Spacing ProtocolsThe commonality in each of these examples is a need to accurately model the effects of flowfield disturbances. The methodologies established throughout the Phase I and II efforts will be directly applicable in improving the industries capability of i) predicting aircraft responses in a simulated operational environment and ii) improving control algorithms for aircraft under a complex spatially varying flowfield."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: While the ability to collect larger volumes of full-motion video (FMV) data grows, analysts within the ISR community struggle to keep pace with the volume, speed, and variety of collection. During Phase 1 Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED), analysts are required to collaborate with a distributed team of sensor operators, collection and mission managers, and other analysts while navigating and interpreting mounds of data across many disparate sources to produce actionable decisions. Given the pace of these data-intensive workflows, analysts frequently encounter a problem of information management, ranging from the coordination challenges associated with maintaining situational awareness and contextual knowledge while exploiting data across sensor types to identify potential targets, to retrieving, processing, and utilizing sensor data in a timely manner once collected. To address this need, Aptima proposes to develop the Adaptive Personalized Environment for Artificial Intelligence and Naturalistic Applications for PED Operational Domain (A PEA IN A POD). When fully implemented, A PEA IN A PODs advanced multimodal human-machine interfaces and interactions for Phase 1 PED of FMV data will improve information management and interaction between FMV analysts and the technologies they use, therefore creating efficiencies while reducing manpower requirements to support a wide range of ISR missions.; BENEFIT: A PEA IN A POD utilizes emerging technologies, such as immersive visualization, multimodal user interfaces, gesture tracking, speech recognition, and multi-touch, to help FMV analysts accomplish data-intensive PED tasks more quickly and effectively. Benefits include:Combining human analytical reasoning and the human visual system with the latest computational tools for analyzing, displaying, and interaction with information;The ability for users to contextualize and interpret sensor and information feeds in real-time via a more naturalistic, embodied experience;Increased analytic capacity and decreased cognitive load by using strategies for managing multimodal interactions in support of the analysts specific tasking;Increased situation awareness and reduced overall workload via context-driven user interfaces and interactions designed for ISR analysis tasks;Commercialization potential within the defense, homeland security, intelligence community, and healthcare markets."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: FMV collection presents a challenge to the Air Force Special Operation Command (AFSOC), charged with the processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) of raw motion imagery to create meaningful intelligence for the warfighter.In order to overcome this challenge, AFSOC operators must be provided with robust human-centered tools and technologies to rapidly, efficiently, and effectively execute FMV PED.Knowledge Based Systems, Inc. (KBSI), along with their research partner PatchPlus, propose to design, assemble and demonstrate an innovative Human-computer Environment for Advanced PED (HEAP) Framework. HEAP is a suite of mixed initiative tools in an extensible framework that supports the use of intuitive human-machine interaction (HMI) technologies, collaboration tools, and anticipatory FMV analysis features to advance the PED paradigm for robust human-machine teaming.HEAP will contain interface abstractions that allow for new input paradigms such as Human Gesture Control, Human Eye Control, and Voice Recognition that will revolutionize FMV PED by increasing efficiency and reducing manpower requirements.Additionally, HEAP will allow the PED system to monitor the human and generate anticipatory actions, alerts, or UI reconfigurations based on human affective state, behaviors, and the task at hand.As a result, PED operators will perform more efficiently in the complex FMV PED environment.; BENEFIT: HEAP provides several benefits to the warfighter including (i) increased human-machine team efficiency using mixed initiative FMV PED capabilities, (ii) reduced manpower requirements by using state-of-the-art interaction technologies to execute tasks more effectively than with a keyboard and mouse, (iii) reductions in human workload by repetitive task reduction, human-centered UI adaptations, and alerts to reduce human operator workload, (iv) rapid integration of new and innovative FMV PED capacities to support the future of FMV PED operations, and (v) improved efficiencies in reporting and product generation due to rapid FMV analysis and intelligence collection.In the short term, the HEAP Framework will facilitate data sensemaking for FMV PED analysts in the intelligence communities of the DoD.Our sponsors from the Human Effectiveness Directorate of AFRL value from a human-centered FMV PED framework that can be tested, verified, and validated in a laboratory setting as well as extended to meet their internal application requirements.Additionally, in the long term, commercial entities in various domains will benefit from not only an ability to quickly identify and analyze video threats, but also a societal advancement to the state-of-the-art of motion video analysis and interaction.The market segment for motion video tools which reduces future investments and improve operations is enormous and we plan to exploit this segment using our intelligence domain skills, intelligence SME input, and unique access to potential end-users."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: ATA Engineering, Inc. (ATA), partnered with L-3 Applied Technologies Inc. (L-3 ATI), proposes the development of configurable models, a simulation framework,and a software interface that will augment biodynamic experiments to provide stakeholders with a screening tool to quickly evaluate injury likelihood given a set of ejection system and occupant parameters. The effort will leverage decades of company experience performing advanced finite element (FE) simulations to create a configurable model of the F-35 ejection equipment (seat, guide rails, cushion, restraints, and flight gear) and methods for applying the governing forces (ejection, gravitational, aerodynamic [windblast], and parachute [drogue and main]) to the model. Using the commercial analysis software LS-DYNA, the component mechanical finite element models (MFEMs) will be coupled with an existing human finite element model (HFEM) developed by L-3 ATI to enable rapid assessment of injury probability and severity. In Phase I, the project team will demonstrate feasibility by creating a functional user interface mockup, integrating mechanical and biodynamic models, executing a simulation of a test rig acceleration event, and comparing the predicted response to measured ATD data. Phase II will involve model refinement, flight load modeling,and preliminary validation using measurements from rocket sled testing of the F-35 seat.; BENEFIT: Including the U.S. Air Force and Navy, F-35 fleets will soon become part of at least thirteen international forces. While component commonality across all F-35 variants (A, B, and C) promises to achieve efficiencies in procurement and sustainment, the aircraft will ultimately fulfill vastly different roles for each operator. In addition, the flight suit equipment, restraints, helmet configuration, and even average pilot sizeall critical factors in injury riskwill undoubtedly vary across these operators, even as the US16E ejection seatremains common. While rocket sled testing will provide some in situ measurement of the loads imparted on the occupant, it will not account for human responses (e.g., pre-ejection bracing) and will only be performed for a small subset of conditions. As a result, the proposed tool will be critical for giving stakeholders responsible for ensuring pilot safety, including Martin-Baker and AFRLs Human Effectiveness DirectorateApplied Neuroscience Branch (RHCP), a means for comprehensively evaluating injury risk across a wide parameter space of equipment and escape condition permutations. As the F-35 ejection system and pilot equipment continue to evolve, ensuring pilot safety will be of paramount importance to the Joint Program Office (JPO). The tool will also aid escape injury assessment for future aircraft, such as the Long-Range Strike Bomber and Trainer-X (T-X), which will have unique flight envelopes."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The extreme ejection conditions in the fifth-generation fighter F-35 could lead to occupant injury. Rocket sled testing of ejection seat with manikins is limited in simulating human response. The current neck injury models and injury criteria from automotive safety are inadequate for the ejection-related injury. We propose to develop the global-to-local finite element models (FEM) and simulation environment to enable fast, accurate simulation of occupant ejection, injury estimation and safety assessment. A fast-running global FEM is performed to establish the biodynamics of restrained occupant under ejection and windblast loadings and to identify critical areas i.e. cervical spine. The local FEM analyzes the spinal injury biomechanics, in which the global FEM provides appropriate boundary conditions. In Phase I we will design the simulation framework for occupants with different sizes in the ejection seat. The biodynamic response of global FEM will be validated against test and simulation data (ATB, Easy5). The detailed FEM of cervical-thoracic-lumbar-pelvis complex will be used to identify the critical variables in the ejection seat that contribute to soft tissue injury and vertebral fracture. A GUI framework will be established to facilitate modeling and simulations of occupant ejection. In Phase II, the FE models and GUI will be improved.; BENEFIT: The developed global-local FE modeling and the simulation environment will provide a new analysis tool for evaluation of ejection-related injury and safety improvement of ejection seat. The main benefit to the pilot is the faster development of better protection with improved survivability in ejection event. The models and software will be available to DoD and DoD prime contractors in open source format. The model development has great applicability to other DoD agencies in the field of ejection safety system. In Phase III, CFDRC plans to work with DOD and private manufacturers to help analyze and improve their ejection seat designs."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: SIFT proposes to build GEMINI (Gestalt Mixed-Initiative Intelligence), a shared workspace where humans and machines collaboratively assemble intelligence products. In a human-machine team, the collaborators have vastly different-- albeit complementary-- cognitive capabilities. Thus, a central research challenge is to expressively and soundly translate from analyst-centric interfaces (for human understanding and high-level fusion) into structured knowledge and goals (for goal-directed autonomy) and back again for intuitive support. The analyst will use an intuitive user interface (UI) to fuse information and define objectives. GEMINI will decode the UI&apos;s elements into structured information and decomposable goals, and then assign goals to specialized agents-- such as graph-matchers, document retrievers, information extractors, and image processors-- to augment the analysts workflow. It will scan agent-generated information for relevance to the analysts objectives and focus, and then present relevant information within intuitive displays using Adaptive Interface Management (AIM) technology. Having pioneered work on AIM, goal- and task-based autonomy, information extraction, and data fusion, SIFT is well-positioned to build and transition GEMINI to customers that need it. By facilitating the bi-directional human-machine information flow and leveraging both parties&apos; innate strengths, GEMINI will enable human-machine teams to identify threats and insights faster and more accurately than ever before.; BENEFIT: By facilitating the bi-directional human-machine information flow and leveraging both parties&apos; innate strengths, GEMINI will enable human-machine teams to identify threats and insights faster and more accurately than ever before.GEMINI&apos;s integration of goal-directed autonomy in an analyst-centric fusion setting will yield synergistic benefits for the human and for the autonomous agents: the analyst receives mission-relevant information in intuitive interfaces to support high-level information fusion; the agents receive the analyst&apos;s hypotheses, context, objectives, and high-level fused information to support goal-directed automation.GEMINI consequently has the commercially-viable feature of reducing the time and technical expertise that an organization requires to remain competitive.The extensibility of GEMINI&apos;s analyst interface-- including displays for monitoring and control-- and of GEMINI&apos;s autonomy manager-- including a goal- and knowledge-based interface for agent metacontrol-- will reduce the cost and effort of extending GEMINI to additional customers with novel information needs.This facilitates integration of diverse autonomous agents toward common objectives, as we will demonstrate in our Phase I effort.Ultimately, GEMINI&apos;s extensibility will help it generalize to strategic intelligence, tactical intelligence, and other human information fusion settings."

Phase I will focus on establishing learning objectives and evaluation criteria; establishing criteria for adapting a 3D game for use with inexpensive haptic device; developing mathematical models of the anatomy and penetration; designing a prototype low-cost haptic device; and planning the integration of models, haptic device, and manikin. These objectives are structured to provide a firm foundation for evaluating, refining, and manufacturing the prototype, creating training scenarios, and preparing for commercialization. The first version of the IO trainer will be a comprehensive AR\/VR sternal insertion unit with haptic capabilities using the FAST1 device, comprehensive metrics and no disposables.; BENEFIT: Lack of a cost-effective and widely deployable IO training device has resulted in limiting use of this lifesaving technology to trained combat medics and paramedics. This research aims to expand the reach of this procedure by creating an AR\/VR IO trainer with no consumable parts that may be used to replace the current live tissue training (LTT) model. This will greatly reduce the total lifecycle cost of training for this device, make it possible to train in and beyond the schoolhouse, and make the IO procedure more widely available."

This SBIR project will demonstrate proof of concept of this revolutionary new teaching model.This system will include state of the art medically correct and realistic interactive visualization of patients at multiple levels (whole patient, organ systems, individual organs, etc.) and haptic devices to providetactile feedback. The proposed system will enable trainees to develop visual representations of intraosseous infusionprocedures with simulated human hands manipulating instruments on a lifelike computer generatedpatient model, that corresponds to their actions through the integration of haptic devices.Optional superimposed internal anatomy, visualized during the procedure reinforces the identification of critical external anatomical landmarks and illustrates the proper guidance of instruments within the body.; BENEFIT: Transition the model through widespread commercialization and government acquisition. Deliver the final product for the government and private sector market. Applications should be ready military schoolhouses, training communities, and the commercial sector."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Warfighters are exposed to many forms of significant stress both sporadically throughout the day and accumulating across long periods of time, which can affect human performance and operational effectiveness. Perhaps often overlooked are the impacts of dehydration on cognitive performance, as even mild dehydration impairs performance related to attention, psychomotor, and immediate memory, all of which are critical functions to the warfighter operating in any environment. Continuous, real-time, quantitative monitoring of dehydration connected to cognitive function would be invaluable to mitigation and management strategies of at-risk warfighters and human operators.To be truly useful to the warfighter, dehydration monitoring would require real-time, non-invasive measurement of definitive dehydration biomarkers shown to correlate with cognitive impairment, a feat yet to be commercially realized. Eccrine Systems proposes analyzing human sweat samples from an ongoing dehydration-cognition study to, for the first time, correlate biomarkers in sweat to dehydration-induced cognitive impairment and develop a dehydration-cognition algorithm. Having proven the feasibility of the approach, will build on its Sweatronics Platform to design a system for monitoring, noninvasively and in real-time, and reporting dehydration status and its cognitive impact as part of a user dashboard relating cognitive state information to the warfighter and related users and systems.; BENEFIT: The creation of a real-time, objective monitoring system to manage the impact of dehydration on cognitive function will have broad impact on airmen, improving situation awareness, decision-making, mission planning, and overall airman task performance. Additionally, broad commercial applications for a wearable dehydration-monitoring device exist in professional athletics, industrial workforce, personal health, and medical applications. Correlating dehydration-monitoring to cognitive function expands these markets, and greatly increases their value proposition. Combined, even with modest adoption levels, these applications represent a multi-billion dollar market opportunity."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Ionterra Sciences proposes to develop a multiplexed fatigue status detection system utilizing sweat as the diagnostic fluid the based on ion detection through anchored biomolecular complexes. A compact, fatigue monitoring device with the 1) sensitivity to identify low concentrations of biomarkers; 2) simplicity of a fitness monitor, 3) robustness of microarray diagnostics 4) use of non-invasive sweat based biomarkers would fulfill the needs of field fatigue identification system and provide numerous logistical benefits to armed forces, and the civilian sector where life-critical decisions are made.A multiplexed device with the simplicity of a fitness monitor that is capable of detecting fatigue early and transmitting the data will provide a solution that mitigates increased risk factors faced by fatigued Warfighters.; BENEFIT: A wide range of stressors puts pilots and Warfighters at risk for psychological trauma and medical difficulties ranging from problems of memory and cognition, substance abuse, and decreased task performance, and fatigue.Unfortunately, mental performance directly translates to mission accomplishment and safety. As people become fatigued there is a substantial increase in the frequency with which longer than usual reaction times occur. Consequently, in military operations greater than 70% of all catastrophic mishaps are caused by human error. Since the research literature and common experience tells us that fatigue and stressors can affect decision-making and performance on the training and battle field, it is imperative that command is capable of detecting fatigue and modifying plans based on Warfighter conditions.Using this information intelligently can result in fewer lives lost and equipment damage."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In recent years, there has been increasing use of time-varying electric fields to manipulate the behavior of biological cells. The application of large electric fields (&gt;105 V\/cm) with nanosecond pulse widths has been observed to produce effects that include long-term polarization of the cells plasma membrane, electrodeformation, and increased uptake of nanoparticles, indicating promise for effective treatment of cancer. Researchers using nsPEF techniques increasingly need to accurately measure the specific temporal, spatial, and amplitude characteristics of the applied field.The dielectric response of the extracellular fluid, the cell geometry, and the physical dimensions of the electrodes all have an impact on the ultimate electric field strength experienced by the cell. To address this need, Nanohmics proposes to develop the Electric Field Measurement Array (EFMA), which will provide electric field measurements with sub-nanosecond temporal response and sub-m spatial resolution.The EFMA can be used directly as a horizontal platform for biological cell experiments, or as part of a standard electroporation cuvette. The EFMA can provide electric field strength and coarse direction with sufficient resolution in time and space to completely characterize the electric field exposure of a single cell from a single nsPEF event.; BENEFIT: EFMA technologys first application will be to provide measuring instrumentation to scientists and engineers who are involved in measuring the spatial and temporal characteristics of electric fields. With EFMA instrumentation, researchers will be able to make better measurements of the physical electric field phenomena that influence the behavior and response of biological cells."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the Air Forces need for software-synthesized multimodal sensor returns to explore data fusion for human-based activities, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Human-Activity Sensor Returns (HASR) modeling software library and simulation framework. It integrates human, environment, and sensor models with physical effects modeling to generate scientifically rigorous synthetic sensor returns. Specifically, the innovation in synchronized simulation of multimodal sensors (e.g., radar, SAR, LIDAR, and hyperspectral) with a single input dataset representing the environment and human activities, will produce synthetic multimodal sensor return data that is consistent across modalities, and high fidelity in human-focused scenarios. With an architecture that scales easily with sensor and environmental model additions, HASR is the first solution for comprehensive and integrated high-fidelity modeling of human activities across multiple sensor modalities, which directly addresses the Air Force need for multimodal human-activity imagery baselines. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of HASR by surveying mathematical sensor and environmental models, developing an end-to-end systems architecture, and demonstrating a preliminary proof-of-concept system. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and demonstrate a functional prototype with a graphical user interface and multimodal capabilities.; BENEFIT: Current imagery baselines for radar, SAR, LIDAR, and hyperspectral sensors were developed independently, without a common 3D scene baseline, and without a focus on human-based activity. These limitations prevent their use for the direct comparison of sensor results in general (due to disparate 3D scenes), and prevent the application of the current imagery baselines to human-based activities. HASR applies a unified 3D scene to every sensor so sensor results can be compared directly, and adds a focus on human activities that will enable those sensor results to be applied to human activities such as walking, running, digging, and throwing. HASR is the first tool that can produce appropriate imagery baselines for evaluation of new sensors, sensor technologies, surveillance monitors, crowd monitors, and reconnaissance technologies in both military and commercial worlds. For example, HASR sensor data could be used to select an optimal sensor(s) and sensor processing technologies for monitoring of neutral civilians with embedded covert agents, for automated surveillance of crowds around military bases. In the commercial world, HASR could be applied to surveillance systems for homes and businesses, to improve automatic detection of potentially covert activities (e.g., mine burial and bomb throwing) while minimizing generation of false alarms from similar benign activities (e.g., gardening and waving)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: There is a need to develop a sufficient-fidelity simulation tool to create multi-sensor datasets for human activity detection and recognition. To address this need, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) and Infoscitex Corporation (IST) propose a novel, integrated, sufficient-fidelity simulation tool called HumanView (HumV). The proposed software will leverage existing tools, integrate commercial, proprietary and COTS multi-physics simulation tools and material properties databases. The key elements of the proposed architecture are: The HumV Models module will be a data store that will contain 3D human models, 3D geometric models of environment, relevant sensor models (RF, LIDAR and Hyperspectral) and platform models (UAV, aircraft) on which the sensors reside. The HumV editor module will allow researchers to discover the available models, manage the configuration associated with a model using a drag-n-drop interface, and create specific activities for the model, and associate mathematical models where appropriate. The HumV simulator module will allow the user to simulate multiple scenarios that will generate the synthetic sensor data for analytics. The goal of the Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of HumV.Specific focus areas will include developing the overall architecture, and developing key HumV components.; BENEFIT: Development of HumV will allow the military to generate realistic and physically sound sensor imagery data from virtual 3D scenes, expanding capabilities of ISR applications. The technology would also be useful in other arenas such as analytical technology development for homeland security applications. HumV would be beneficial to developers of first responder support equipment for operations such as search and rescue.Commercial application of HumV include the fast growing field of robotics. Just as LIDAR simulators are used by roboticists today to test their algorithms, HumV may be used by developers of self-driving cars (which use a variety of sensors) and any other Artificial Intelligence or robotic systems that interact with humans, enabling the development of algorithms for navigating in human environments."

        "abstract": "Barron Associates proposes development of the micro-Swarm Environmental Sensing (SENS) technology to safely and efficiently gather high spatiotemporal resolution wind data to initialize diagnostic wind models. SENS includes UAV platforms instrumented with meteorological sensors and swarm \/ path planning software to coordinate behaviors amongst multiple vehicles. SENS fills an important need in modeling wind flow through urban environments. Accurate diagnostic tools serve a critical role in many military, civilian, and home defense applications. Micro-scale diagnostic models fill an important operation need as they have low computational requirements and can execute on hand-held devices making them an invaluable asset for field and mobile operations. Studies have shown that accurate initialization data increases the accuracy of such models, particularly in urban environments and complex terrain. The evaluation and the improvement of urban flow models rely on the observations of flows and turbulence from flows near ground level to the RSL at high spatiotemporal resolution. Swarms of UAVs developed with SENS technology have the potential to capture these observations, and will be instructed to target information-rich areas. These areas consist, for example, of areas with large spatial gradients in wind shear and temperature that are important in generating or destructing turbulence kinetic energy."

The proposed approach uses a micro UAV equipped with local meteorological sensor in conjunction with a mathematical model. The wind field is then estimating using specialized data processing and computational methods and current measurements. The approach promises to create a fast and manageable solution for covering the 3DWF grid volume. The proposed solution also leverages several Toyon technologies for UAV routing, navigation and control, decentralized asset management for a swarm of micro UAV&apos;s, and domain knowledge in the area transport and dispersion modeling. The Phase I research will assess the feasibility of the MWFMS solution through a combination of performance modeling and proof-of-principle testing."

        "abstract": "A mortar team positions itself on an urban battlefield. Theyre tasked to support operators in the urban landscape. Unknown wind conditions and the probability of civilian casualties complicate the mission. An Army engineer pulls a 20 pound canister from his teams MRAP, sets it in the middle of a dirt road. He unscrews the top and starts an app on his ATAK tablet. The desired wind field measurement area was pre-programmed into the app during mission planning, so he merely presses the launch button. 120 quadcopter nano-drones stream out of the canister four at a time, each weighing 50 grams, and measuring 5 inches across. During the next ten minutes, the nano-drone swarm measures wind intensity in the specified area. They downlink data to the app via a mesh network. During the flight, the engineer unfurls a funnel shaped fixture and places it atop the canister. Upon mission completion, the vehicles return to the canister through the funnel. Quickly they are stacked back into the launch canister. The vehicles recharge and are ready to fly again in 20 minutes. This is the WeatherHive nano-UAV swarm, developed by GreenSight Agronomics teamed with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratorys Swarm Research Group."

        "abstract": "Airborne networks provide the ideal backbone alternative to legacy ground infrastructure and SATCOM for providing C2 and other communication to forward operating units. Airborne networks offer reliable coverage, fast deployment, survivability, low installation cost, among many other advantages.When compared with legacy point-to-point airborne links and mobile ad-hoc terrestrial network, however, airborne networks present significantly tougher technical challenges ranging from wireless channel types to node dynamics and susceptibility to interference. Furthermore, airborne networks with next generation capabilities must exhibit superior spectrum efficiency to support as many users in the battlefield with minimal available spectrum.In this effort we look at taking full advantage of multi-antenna techniques across the entire network stack to achieve several multiplicative factors in spectrum efficiency. We combine the well known physical layer spatial multiplexing MIMO with new higher layer features such as network MIMO, multi-user MIMO, and MIMO-aware multi-cast routing in a low-SWaP low-cost portable radio form factor. Such higher layer features require sophisticated collaboration protocols between network nodes.In addition to spectrum efficiency, the airborne network will include mature technological features such as MIMO radio interference mitigation, dynamic spectrum access, link adaptation, among others to deliver on a complete, robust solution."

        "abstract": "The airborne tier of our militarys communications network plays a critical role in enabling real-time situational awareness, allowing warfighters to synchronize their operations both on and off the battlefield. As the number of users sharing broadband data grows, new technologies are required to mitigate radio frequency (RF) interference for airborne relays and network subscribers. A robust and unified solution must include subsystems that address detection and mitigation of interference at every tier of the protocol stack.As the final element in the RF transmit chain and the first element in the RF receive chain, the antenna plays a critical role in establishing the sensitivity of an RF transceiver. By incorporating hardware-level interference mitigation, the antenna is uniquely capable of protecting the transceiver against high-power interference while also preserving its ability to operate over its entire operational spectrum. For this reason, interference-mitigation techniques implemented in the physical (PHY) layer of the protocol stack are an especially important piece of a robust solution to minimize both cosite and off-platform sources of interference.During Phase I, FIRST RF will demonstrate the practical capabilities of hardware-based interference mitigation systems and explore adapting this approach to provide a universal RF interference-mitigation and anti-jam (RIMA) solution."

This new architecture leverages and enhances commercial\/Government off-the-shelf (COTS\/GOTS) cloud components and delay-tolerant networking (DTN). Specifically, the innovation in cloud\/network architecture enhancements will enable the aerial layer cloud to offer resources to ground, air, and space nodes in a challenging aerial environment. Connectivity and resources (e.g., storage, virtual servers, and system management) are reliably provided from resource pools with redundancy despite changing network connectivity due to node mobility, jamming, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, and loss of SATCOM and terrestrial gateways. These specifications directly address the Air Force requirements for airborne layer network cloud computing with legacy and advanced communication links in interservice, interalliance operations. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of CALM by developing a system architecture, and demonstrating and delivering a laboratory instantiation, at TRL 4\/ 5, serving the tactical edge user and other temporary and permanent users. In Phase II, POC plans to construct a demonstration, at TRL-6, of the aerial cloud layer with heterogeneous mobile nodes, multiple networks, and link adversity."

The proposed antenna architecture allows physical separation of transmit and receive feed networks resulting in the requisite isolation for full duplex networks met using a distributed combination of spatial and spectral techniques. Furthermore, the MBA is achieved without requiring multiple full scale antenna deployments to intersperse beams or a highly linearized active beamforming network. The proposed solution enables overlapped feeds to achieve high efficiency operation of the antenna for each spot beam using passive structures. The requisite field of view that enables spot beam relocation is accomplished using an innovative 2-axis mechanism that reduces actuator complexity and increasing system reliability for launch and long life operations in space. The active MMICs baselined greatly simplify the frequency up and down conversion functions in a highly integrated package containing all the required low noise and transmit power amplifiers."

        "abstract": "Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol provides significant benefits such as increased air safety and improved air-traffic conflict detection and resolution since it allows other aircrafts in the vicinity to know their relative positions without relying on an infrastructure. Despite the years of work on the development of standards, testing, etc., the ADS-B protocol does not specify mechanisms to ensure that the protocol messages are either authentic or adhere to any security properties. Due to this vulnerability, the ADS-B transmissions can be easily spoofed, modified or hijacked. Thus, the issue of secure transmissions is one of the key aspects of our proposal which makes this opportunity significant for the civil and defense aviation community. In this proposal, we recommend asystem that will assure secure ADS-B transmissions, while being a cost-effective architecture for providing modularity, affordability, and speed of deployment. The proposed architecture for NextGen ADS-B integration does not require any modifications to the ADS-B Transceiver, and thus can be implemented without any delays before the year 2020 mandate set by the FAA and combat authorities.We propose to illustrate a laboratory scale concept of this design and demonstrate its proof-of-concept during Phase I, using ground\/air equipment, time and resources permitting."

        "abstract": "As part of an ongoing effort to modernize the air traffic control (ATC) system, the FAA is requiring aircraft to become compliant with the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) doctrine, which adopts new methodology for ATC wireless communications. The NexGen design offers more precise air traffic monitoring at an affordable cost compared to traditional radar-based systems.One of the key requirements of the NextGen transformation is that aircraft support the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol, a wireless protocol for broadcasting position, velocity, identification and other information for reception by ground stations and aircraft. ADS-B does not make use of encryption or authentication which exposes it to spoofing and eavesdropping attacks. These attacks can be conducted from malicious ground stations or aircraft in flight using inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radio equipment.Using a novel approach described herein, PreTalen proposes a system (Hardened Electronic ADS-B Protection System - HEAPS) that will protect against attempts to send false position or velocity information in ADS-B transmissions. Our algorithms are based on signal characteristics that are unable to be spoofed by sophisticated adversaries. The approach also works on the existing ADS-B protocol and requires no changes to the standard or transmitters."

        "abstract": "Analysts and operators need to know as soon as possible when their satellites are in danger, so that responses can be initiated to provide tactical protection. Numerica proposes to leverage its advanced prototype software, Athena, to provide timely and reliable indications and warnings (I&amp;Ws) derived from evolving situations by discovering anomalous correlations across events detected using multi-source, multi-INT data. The Athena software prototype currently uses state-of-the-art data-driven unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning methods for joint normality modeling and anomalous event recognition. It was developed under previous AFRL funding, and validated using real photometric data collected from electro-optical sensors (i.e., light-curve data, an example of measurement and signature intelligence, or MASINT), as well as certain open source structured datasets (structured OSINT). The core technology has also been applied by Numerica to detect distributed anomalies and advanced persistent threats (APTs) in cyber networks. Under the proposed effort, Numerica would upgrade Athena to exploit additional types of multi-INT data (including SIGINT), with the goal of demonstrating reduced false alarm rates and increased probability of anomalous event recognition. The Phase I program will culminate with a proof-of-concept demonstration of the I&amp;W tool using combinations of real-world and simulated datasets."

SSA community tools being developed now are working on the first step to provide information to the warfighter from multi-INT data sources for the characterization of space objects and the identification of specific events of interest. Our intelligent system will learn patterns of life (e.g., correlations in normal entity\/event relationships) to detect threat-caused abnormal relationship patterns. Our proposed approach is to divide &amp; conquer this entity\/event relationship learning, detection, and characterization problem into four types. We will apply the appropriate problem-to-solution mappings to each and integrate these into the Event Relationship Recognition for SSA (ERRS) prototype.ComSpOC will provide information from a network of diverse phenomenology global sensors. The ERRS will provide entity\/event and relationship recognition, relationship learning, abnormal relationship detection, mission impact assessment, and CACM. The ERRS prototype will address selected portions of these based upon the data. We will extend our Performance Assessment and Process Management (PAPM) tools to evaluate experiments on ERRS."

Todays computer systems and mission assurance approaches are largely built on a foundation of static configurations and require manual upgrades or lengthy software development phases to increase the security or stability of a system. The concept of anti-fragility suggests that a system or process improves over time as it encounters issues or faults, rather than the current behavior, of degrading over time as faults are encountered. Under the AWARE effort the team will research, design, and prototype a multi-tiered infrastructure based on a series of abstractions and virtual machine (VM) technologies to provide a system that increases security and stability overtime as faults or issues are encountered."

        "abstract": "Cloud computing systems are rapidly growing in scale and complexity. The large-scale, complex and dynamic cloud environments make failure recovery and anomaly detection critical yet complex and time consuming tasks. Anti-fragility approaches are based on a concept that some systems could be rather strengthened by volatilities and faults. Hence, high-availability of cloud infrastructures must be complemented by leveraging anti-fragility properties, in order to increase system elasticity and resilience; embracing failure not only in the test environment but also in the production one, which would lead to a better preparation for the inevitable failures that may occur.To address this emerging need, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes the Cyber-Inoculator solution, aimed at building a comprehensive set of multi-layered system tools, methods, and capabilities to incrementally increase overall resiliency of the cloud and virtualization-based productionsystem through fault and error induction, failure analysis and localization,and automated code repair. Cyber-Inoculator neither requires target source code instrumentation nor depends on continuous system monitoring. Cyber-Inoculators are deployed on a host VM of a virtualized server, and supports wide specter number of different cloud-based enterprise fault-tolerant computing architectures."

We will evaluate a class of structures that are robust and easy to build using a combination of conventional machining and electrode discharge machining. The proposed techniques are based on our successful fabrication of high power capable overmoded coupled cavity circuits for V-band TWTs. The fabrication techniques will be chosen to allow scaling of the proposed technology to higher frequencies such as the G-band. The various subsystems of the TWT will be modeled and optimized using the latest suite of electromagnetic, particle-in-cell and beam-wave interaction codes."

        "abstract": "The primary objective of this effort is to develop a framework for providing enhanced space situational awareness (SSA) through the ability to project and visualize threats to blue space assets, and assess the impact of those threats to the assets and the missions they support. The Assessing and Projecting Situations In Space (APSIS) framework leverages a domain agnostic TRL 6 capability for reducing multi-INT data to perform situation identification and threat assessment. APSIS extends this framework by developing models for projecting states and threats within the space domain. The principal benefit of APSIS is the ability to predict threats left of the event, which allows for proactive mitigation strategies for protecting vital space assets. A proof-of-concept prototype for APSIS will be developed during Phase I, including space domain state and threat projection plug-ins, as well as input managers for ingesting multi-INT SSA data. Research into enhancing APSIS core capabilities through the inclusion of a probabilistic rule engine to augment the space domain context models will also be performed. Lastly, a highly customizable web-based user interface will be developed to allow end users the ability to visualize APSIS results, as well as forensically analyze the evidentiary data leading to the results."

SAVANT will rapidly assess the vulnerability of blue space assets to potential ground and space-based threats, and provide a heightened awareness of the mission impact posed by these threats so that space commanders may make timely decisions. We will develop SAVANT to serve as a plug-in component to a broader SSA architecture, leveraging dynamic catalog updates and space object characterization to inform our vulnerability analysis, and providing projected threat event windows as vital information for other SSA services. Knowledge of potential threat event windows will support high-level threat assessment and fusion software, and will provide the collection requirements needed to discern coming attacks. Finally, we will apply our expertise in human-system interface research to design visual displays that convey this information in ways that promote better situation awareness and decision-making. Together, the analytical and visual components of SAVANT will provide an immediate and deep understanding of potential threats, enabling commanders to make the best possible operational decisions in the time permitted to protect our assets and perserve mission success."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: CBM+ and Digital Thread initiatives within the Air Force seek to reduce maintenance cost and time, improve the availability of aircraft, and enable a better understanding of the state of an aircraft. This drives the ability to make better maintenance and sustainment decisions. This improvement in decision making is being realized in the effort to transition from fixed maintenance intervals based upon worst case scenarios to aircraft specific tailored sustainment. To accomplish this, however, sustaining engineers need to have as much information as possible about the state of a particular aircraft. To achieve this end, a system is needed to aggregate all the data regarding an aircraft, map this data onto a 3D model, and provide visualization and analysis tools.Etegents NLign software provides these capabilities, and has demonstrated an ability to provide realization of the CBM+ and Digital Thread initiatives.NLign is currently used by the A-10, T-38, and F-15 ASIP programs, as well as F\/A-18 sustainment at NAVAIR North Island.The Advanced Robotic Laser Coating Removal System (ARLCRS) developed by Titan Robotics is one such source of data which engineers could leverage to better understand the state of an aircraft under maintenance.; BENEFIT: Development of this capability will place more information in the hands of sustaining engineering, allowing for improved decision making.Future data collected from the ARLCRS, potentially with additional sensors, could be transferred into NLign to augment these capabilities further.Commercial manufacturing and maintenance would equally benefit from engineers having as much information as possible."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the Air Force need for new information synthesis algorithms to increase the situational awareness of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) during sense-and-avoid (SAA) activities in the terminal airspace (TA), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new All-source Terminal Information Synthesis and Situational Awareness (ATISSA) algorithm, based on all-source information synthesis and self-managed uncertainty reduction and conflict resolution. Specifically, the innovation in real-time information synthesis framework and uncertainty management will enable the ATISSA to process information and messages from off-board sensors and extract information related to SAA operations. As a result, ATISSA offers enhanced situational awareness of surrounding aircraft and environment conditions, which directly address the Air Force requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of ATISSA by developing and integrating ATISSA key algorithms into a Phase I software prototype that provides increased situational awareness and SAA in the TA through information synthesis. In Phase II, the ATISSA information synthesis algorithms will be further developed and expanded to include other types of off-board data. Algorithms for managing data uncertainties and resolving conflicting information will also be developed. These algorithms will be integrated into a Phase II prototype for demonstration in hardware-in-the-loop simulation.; BENEFIT: The proposed ATISSA technology will result in an enhanced situational awareness software application for commercial and government applications. The ATISSA offers enhanced situational awareness for UASs, which is highly desired in a wide range of commercial applications, including security monitoring, robotic control, manufacturing control, and search-and-rescue operations."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The unmanned aircraft system (UAS) industry has been working towards integration in the national airspace system (NAS).The work proposed facilitates unmanned systems to co-exist with normal air traffic without major modification to the current and planned infrastructure.The Department of Defense has emphasized not only the NAS integration requirement through their Unmanned Aircraft System Airspace Integration Plan, but also the requirement to deploy globally into foreign and international airspace. Most UAS operate with a remote operator with technology and trends pushing UAS designs to operating autonomously. In either scenario, with a pilot or autonomous operations, sensing and avoiding (SAA) other NAS users is key to UAS integration. Current avoidance technologies include both Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) and Airborne Sense and Avoid (ABSAA).Sensor typically used for SAA become overwhelmed in terminal area due to ground clutter.To address this situation a TeRminal Area Conflict Estimation System (TRACES) is proposed to synthesize and present UAS data in terminal area. The systems uses voice recognition of terminal area broadcasts combined with advanced statistics measures to predict conflict volumes and target trajectories in the terminal area.; BENEFIT: TRACES will provide a UAS the ability to predict passive conflicts in the terminal area. The system will be deployed to military and civil unmanned systems to facilitate safe navigation in the national airspace."

Based on our extensive experience in identifying counterfeit components, we propose an advanced optical solution that simultaneously compares 6 unique features associated only with counterfeit components.An unprecedentedly high level of detection certainty is anticipated because these features are difficult for the counterfeiter to reproduce considering the cost and the profit-seeking nature of the activity.The proposed automated tool is also cost effective and capable of high throughput.It is simple to operate without the need for special training. Phase I will demonstrate counterfeit identification rate over 99% by testing over 10 counterfeit component examples.A completed system will be produced and extensively tested in the Phase II."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Many soldier-worn military assets depend on power provided by rechargeable batteries. Improvements to system capabilities come with requisite increases in power and energy consumption. As such, improvements to rechargeable power systems are needed to meet these growing demands. For optimal mission capability, requirements for additional power systems come against weight and mounting space limitations, which can affect the movement capabilities of the dismounted soldier. Therefore, to support battlefield airmen, the Air Force is seeking the development of a multifunctional battery to be integrated with SAPI plates within tactical vests, which could address the space limitations for power systems. However, safety is of utmost concern in the implementation of these battery systems, in particular in the event of ballistic impact. In line with these safety and performance goals, Lynntech seeks to develop and test novel electrolyte systems designed to provide increased mechanical and fail-safe support while still meeting the necessary performance requirements of such a battery system. In the Phase I, Lynntech will perform studies to evaluate these materials for energy, capacity, power, mechanical stability, and safety through experimental testing and modeling. The materials and configuration that best meet the needs of the Air Force will be recommended for further development.; BENEFIT: Current materials and lithium ion cell designs are inadequate for many military and civilian needs because of limited form factors and safety. Delivering safe, portable energy in modular form factors as proposed expands the current market and opens up new ones. High-energy, high-safety batteries are useful in many military settings including soldier power, vehicle power, remote sensors, and others.Private sector applications include those that require highly safe batteries such as automotive batteries, medical devices, and consumer electronics. Delivering high-energy, high-safety batteries as proposed would allow for increased depth in a variety of markets through improvements to battery capabilities."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Phase I proposal presented here details a procedure to produce metal encapsulated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for integration into wiring for high-temperature applications. The addition of CNTs into traditional metal wiring improves high-temperature conductivity by reducing the losses due to lattice vibration at elevated temperatures. The process is based on a simple, scalable, one-pot process that uses emulsion chemistry to coat a metal on the surface of the nanotubes. This coating will create a copper-coated CNT nanopowder which enhances the binding of CNT to the wire matrix, improves mixability, and limits aggregation. In addition, the emulsion chemistry enhances the CNT\/Cu interface, improving both electrical and mechanical properties between the CNT and copper matrix. The consulting investigator has previously developed the emulsion chemistry process for polymers. The process will be adapted for coating CNTs with metals and the coated CNTs will be leveraged with Mainstreams expertise in nanocomposite manufacturing.; BENEFIT: The development of copper wire with increased ampacity and thermal stability offers significant benefits for next-generation aircraft. Adding aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the electrical wiring reduces the losses associated with elevated wire temperature, increasing the aircrafts operational window. The proposed composite wire will be light-weight and have increased conductivity and ampacity. These properties combine to reduce required wire diameter and wire weight and can present significant savings in fuel costs. Commercial aircraft would benefit similarly and microelectronic systems could benefit from the decrease in wire diameter necessary to handle the required currents."

However, increasing demands for power and data pushes the need for more capacity, and the total contribution of electrical conductor weight to the system has become significant in aircraft, ships, rail, and automobiles and power applications like overhead transmission lines.In this Phase I and eventual Phase II we propose the development for carbon nanotube (CNT) aluminum current carrying composites, in terms of improving their electrical properties, thermal properties, as well as their other properties.We will focus on CNT additions to aluminum, and the composites made with them as base metals.We will focus on the properties of conductivity, ampacity (maximum current which can be carried), thermal conductivity, heat generation and removal at high currents, and mass normalized values of these first four properties. This will be our focus in Phase I, in Phase II it will be necessary to consider other aspects, including strength, scalability, affordability, process control, andprocesses.; BENEFIT: The initial market applications will be where weight is at a premium and electrical wiring is needed. These include obvious industries like overhead transmission lines, aircraft, outer space, military, transportation (ships, trains, and autos), and wind turbine generators on tall towers. The secondary industries that are addressable include where high current densities are needed to obtain higher magnetic fields. Some of the early market applications where these high performance carbon nanotube (CNT) wires could penetrate the marketplace are motors, generators, fault current limiters, transformers, transmission cables, MRI, and High Energy Physics type applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Both commercial and military aircraft are being flown\/utilized for extended operational time. The aircraft cumulative flight hours often extends the original design limits. Each aircraft manufacturer calculates aircraft fatigue and damage using different techniques. A more accurate prediction of the remaining life and inspection intervals for an individual aircraft is required, as these aging aircraft are kept in operational status. ZONA Technology, Inc. has been working closely with The Boeing Company to develop a software process to more accurately predict the maneuver loads on an aircraft. This program is called Stick-to-Stress Dynamic Flight Simulation (StS-DFS); which can generate structural component loads and stresses due to a pilot stick input command. In the Phase I effort, we will further enhance StS-DFS using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver to generate the steady aerodynamic forces and the ZONA Unstructured Linearized Unsteady Solver to generate the unsteady aerodynamic forces. This enhanced StS-DFS is referred to as RANS-based StS-DFS.F-15 Saudi aircraft, an on-going Boeing project for verifying a new &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; capability, was selected to validate the RANS-based StS-DFS system with the newly acquired flight test data from the F-15 Saudi flight test.; BENEFIT: Recently, the Air Force Research Laboratory has produced a long-term vision, called the Airframe Digital Twin that calls for the development of a physics-based process of determining initial or remaining aircraft structural life. The outcome of the proposed Phase I effort will be one of the crucial early steps towards the Airframe Digital Twin vision.Several U.S. military aircraft such as F-16, F-15, C-5 and A-10 and commercial aircraft are reaching or are already beyond their originally designed fatigue lives. To identify their residual fatigue life or extend their fatigue life by retrofit, accurate loads spectra to perform fatigue analysis or ground fatigue tests on these aircraft is required.Such an accurate loads spectra can be generated by RANS-based StS-DFS using the recorded flight test data of individual fleet members of these aircraft as input to keep track of the individual fatigue life as proposed in the USAF Digital Twin vision with the concept of improved fatigue calculation.In Phase II, the ZONA\/Boeing team will develop a process that can extract the stresses generated by the RANS-based StS-DFS software around the identified fatigue critical regions in the structure and use these stresses as input to their respective structural component damage tolerance models; leading to an updated life prediction and inspection interval of an individual aircraft."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Aircraft structure aging and life prediction require accurate prognosis of the dynamic loads and stress spectra as well as aircraft structure dynamic response leading to fatigue damage. CFDRC proposes to develop an ultra-efficient physics-based computational aeroservoelasticity Reduced Order Models (ROM) for real-time prediction and simulation of aircraft dynamic loads, stress spectra and fatigue damage. The distinguishing factors of the proposed effort are; (1) physics-based loads and stresses prediction tools, (2) nonlinear ROM techniques to address strong nonlinearity in maneuvering aircraft while retaining low model dimensions and ultra-fast simulation speed, and (3) rigorous orthogonality constraint approach for ROM parameterization for enhanced identification of triggering parameters of stress concentration and crack. Phase I will focus on adaptation of high-fidelity computational technologies for quantifying the dynamic aeroelastic loads and stress spectra, development of nonlinear ROM for both aerodynamics loads and structural responses, and feasibility study to quantify dynamic loads and stress spectra for a generic fighter aircraft model. Phase II focus will be on development and integration of fatigue and damage tolerance analysis tools, complete developments of the ROM platform; including ROM automation, parameterization, software optimization, extensive verification and validation of the tools, and software integration with AFRL-relevant tools for damage tolerance analysis.; BENEFIT: The proposed nonlinear reduced order model aeroservoelasticity framework will provide accurate and ultra efficient tool to characterize aircraft aging and fatigue damage. The tool will have direct and significant impact on reliability and safety procedures of aircraft aging programs. Direct Air Force applications of the technology are in aircraft maintenance and inspection programs. The potential primary customers include aircraft, rotorcraft and other space vehicles service life expansion programs for DOD and their prime contractors. Potential commercial applications include rotorcraft civil transport life prediction and accident investigation by FAA and aircraft manufacturers, micro-electronical-mechanical systems (MEMS), propulsion systems, microfluidic, and others."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Our Phase I proposal focuses on the design, fabrication and testing of all the individual components for a smart node for FADEC. This will consist of sensors, sensor interface electronics, passives, and high temperature electronic substrates. We propose to use special design and cost-effective manufacturing techniques for wide temperature operational range from -55oC to 225oC. Specifically, in Phase 1, we plan to develop a wide temperature semi-custom capacitive MEMS air flow sensor as a prototype example. The MEMS anemometer with passive components will be integrated on a Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) substrate. The LTCC substrate is a multilayer ceramic technology that provides not only interconnects between the components but also passive components even in the inner layers of the stack. The technology provides a capability to make high quality passives, antennas, custom packages and active substrates for high temperature electronics and thus, it offers the possibility to build complete modules using hybrid integration. LTCC has excellent mechanical and electrical properties and offers superior high-frequency and high-temperature performance and device miniaturization for high demand applications. Our proposed smart node would satisfy all constrains on size, weight, power and cost while providing high performance as part of next generation FADECs.; BENEFIT: The smart node that consists of sensors, actuators, signal conditioning and processing components, shared I\/O bus etc. would make a huge impact on the next generation FADEC devices in terms of simplicity and cost. Commercial applications include but not limited to both military and civilian aircraft engines, alternative energy, and power control, and additive manufacturing."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Thermal requirements for aerospace and military electronics pose significant issues for traditional PCBs. Under extreme environmental conditions, organic PCBs suffer from numerous reliability concerns with delamination and moisture absorption being prime concerns. The TCE of organic materials further introduces a source of failure from via integrity. One of the most reliable substrate materials available for military and aerospace applications is multi-layer ceramics, specifically LTCC which allows for the use of noble metal conductors providing low loss, excellent conductivity, and long-term reliability. The ceramic dielectric material exhibits a stable dielectric constant independent of temperature and frequency, while the low TCE insures that via integrity is maintained even in the harshest of environments. Test data has conclusively demonstrated sustained operation at temperatures in excess of 500 degrees C. The ceramic substrate is relatively immune, therefore, to the majority of all reliability concerns when operating in a high temperature environment. Limiting the use of LTCC has been the cost when compared to organic materials. By applying newer additive manufacturing processes such as three dimensional printing and utilizing Omegas proprietary plating system in the fabrication of LTCC substrates, these perceived impediments to the use of LTCC can be reduced or eliminated.; BENEFIT: The benefits from the new substrate fabrication processes and materials along with additional improvements in existing LTCC fabrication techniques will allow lower cost, quicker turn prototypes, low volume, and high volume LTCC production to be attainable. This innovative LTCC substrate approach will allow for increased Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements to be met, cost targets attained, improved performance at all frequencies realized, and higher temperature and higher reliability substrates to be fabricated which outperform and are directly cost-competitive with higher end organic PCBs. The new materials and processes will find immediate military opportunities with the U.S. Air Force and other branches of the DoD supporting programs and platforms as varied as engine control modules, missile guidance systems, avionics, radars, electronic warfare (EW), electronic counter measures (ECM), and communications."

High-speed Tomo-PIV measurements will be correlated with two-color OH-PLIF thermometry to shed insights onto key physicochemical processes in turbulent combustion, flame stabilization and combustion instabilities in afterburners. Different from high-speed planar stereo-PIV measurements and hot-wire measurements, high-speed measurements of volumetric velocity with Tomo-PIV enable turbulence analyses without resorting to Taylors hypothesis of frozen turbulence, particularly suitable for studying turbulence evolution in spatially-developing flows. Data and analyses will be made available to AFRL personnel and combustion researchers to guide development and validation of turbulent closure models for numerical simulation of turbulent combustion and optimize design and operation of afterburners.; BENEFIT: Combustion instabilities and blowoff are two major technical challenges facing design and operation of afterburners and other high-performance combustion and propulsion systems. To shed insights on combustion instabilities and blowoff and guide afterburner design and operation, high-speed burst-mode Tomo-PIV measurements will be correlated with temperature measurements via two-color OH-PLIF thermometry and synchronized with HCO measurements via CH2O\/OH PLIF (if time permits) to resolve flame\/turbulence\/acoustics interactions along the separating shear layer in afterburners within a large range of length and time scales.1. Immediate benefits to the Air Force: The proposed high-speed measurements of turbulent combustion and data analyses are of immediate relevance to design and operation of afterburners with enhanced performance, operability, reliability and sustainability.2. Scientific discoveryHigh-speed Tomo-PIV measurements allow complete determination of the strain rate tensor, the vorticity vector and the strain rate upstream the flame front, and enable turbulence analyses without resorting to Taylors hypothesis of frozen turbulence. High-speed Tomo-PIV measurements correlated with temperature measurements and\/or synchronized with HCO measurements spatially, temporally and fully resolve flame\/turbulence\/acoustics interactions within a large range of length and time scales. Benchmark data will be used for development and validation of turbulence closure models, including unsteady flamelet models.3. Economic security and prosperityThe proposed research on turbulent combustion, flame stabilization and combustion instabilities sheds insights onto fundamental mechanisms and key physicochemical processes in flame\/turbulence\/acoustics interactions, which are of immediate relevance to R&amp;D of advanced combustion and propulsion systems, including but not limited to afterburners, gas turbine engines, internal combustion engines, ramjet engines, rockets and even industrial furnaces.

Requirements for increased heat rejection from all types of systems are wide-spread.With the advent of innovative additive fabrication\/manufacturing methods, with which complex structures are constructed layer-by-layer, it is now possible to fabricate heat exchangers in which internal flow channels and external envelopes are no longer constrained to shapes predetermined by traditional manufacturing limitations.This recent maturation of additive manufacturing and the potential improvements associated with conformal and structurally embedded heat exchangers provide opportunities for the advancement of the thermal management state of the art.These capabilities can be leveraged across the vehicle subsystems (fuel, PTMS, and engine) to more effectively harness the available heat sinks on the aircraft. One such opportunity has been identified on the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).The effort defined in this proposal seeks to optimize a new Structurally Embedded Heat Exchanger within an underutilized volume.; BENEFIT: Weapon systems that currently have heat exchangers can be retrofitted with a more effective system.New weapon systems are demanding more and more heat sink capacity and are giving rise to a fundamentally new class of enabling technologies and Integrated Propulsion Power And Thermal has emerged as a key technology thrust for next-generation air platforms.By considering the overall thermal, structural and volumetric considerations as an integrated package up front, there is renewed emphasis on structurally embedded and conformal shaped heat exchangers.Commercial aircraft, trucks and\/or autos needing more cooling with little space also can benefit."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Materials used in high pressure turbine blades limit the life and temperature capability of the component, and thus the attainable thrust or power of the turbine engine.Lowering the temperature of the HP turbine blade cooling air will improve the heat transfer, resulting in lower metal temperatures which allow higher Rotor Inlet Temperature , or conversely longer blade life if the RIT remains the same. Since the air used to cool the turbine blades is compressor discharge air, a lower temperature air stream such as the fan bypass flow stream has a significantly lower temperature (depending on the engine, in the order of 800 R) which can be used in a conformal, structurally embedded heat exchanger to lower the temperature of the cooling air, while adding the extracted heat energy to the bypass flow stream.By utilizing existing components located within the fan bypass stream, an integral, embedded heat exchanger can be designed, which would run the hot compressor bleed\/cooling air through the embedded heat exchanger, providing improved heat transfer and blade cooling effectiveness, which can enhance temperature capability and or life or both, with the resulting benefits of higher thrust without compromising blade life, or simply longer life.; BENEFIT: The ability to significantly lower the temperature of the turbine blades cooling air translates into higher engine thrust capability, longer turbine blade life, and or both. The implication of the enhanced thrust, resulting from the higher Rotor Inlet Temperature, is that a throttle push can be accomplished without decreasing blade life, thus enabling higher aircraft performance, i.e. take off, climb, and cruise power, without compromising engine time on wing.If the Rotor Inlet Temperature is maintained at the previous rating and cooled cooling air is provided, then the life of the turbine blade will be significantly improved:as a rule of thumb, every 25 degrees Fahrenheit will reduce blade life by 50%, hence cooled cooling air in this case will in turn result in longer blade life and engine hot section replacement intervals, and therefore also longer engine time on wing, which of course is a direct operating cost reduction, as well as a an enhancement on readiness and mission capability."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In advanced high-performance military aircraft, the fuel not only serves as the source of energy for the combustion process, but also serves as the primary coolant for all on-board heat sources. As such, the fuel can experience heat loads and temperatures that result in oxidative, or under extreme conditions, pyrolytic decomposition. Such conditions result in compositional changes to the fuel and in the formation of gums, tars, and soot, all of which can lead to system degradation and poor performance, increase maintenance costs, and reduced system availability directly impacting force readiness. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fuel composition measurement utilizes a wide variety of analytical techniques for detection of bulk and trace species via chromatography and\/or mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy, electrochemical detection, and atomic absorption or emission spectroscopy.All of these SOTA techniques involve removing a sample of fuel from the ARSFSS and transporting it to a measurement apparatus. During this process, the sample material is at lower pressure and temperature than when it is in the ARSFSS under reactive conditions. The proposed Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program by Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) will develop and demonstrate an online measurement system for characterizing compositional changes in jet fuel.; BENEFIT: The proposed diagnostic for determining fuel composition of jet fuel will allow online measurements of fuel composition under reactive conditions without removing sample from the fuel system and transporting it to other instrumentation. This will allow real-time data collection that can be used to determine the impact of the fuel composition on the combustion and thermal management system of high performance aircraft as well as provide insight to the decomposition mechanisms occurring in the fuel under thermal stress. ACT will fabricate lab-scale systems for fuel testing in fuel system simulators and seek to miniaturize and commercialize the diagnostic system for direct integration in high-performance aircraft. Providing the ability to monitor fuel composition in real-time will push the limits of performance, efficiency, and force readiness in advanced high-performance aircraft."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The limits of high-performance aircraft continue to be pushed, requiring more capacity from thermal management systems as hydraulic, mechanical, and pneumatic power systems are replaced with electrical components. Rejecting this heat to the fuel can lead to composition changes and the production of insolubles and surface deposits via pyrolysis and oxidation at elevated fuel temperatures, especially at walls and hot spots. As such, it is important to understand and monitor online the thermal degradation processes.A few trace compounds have been identified as critical in the thermal oxidative chemical process including hydroperoxides, reactive sulfur compounds, polar organic compounds, trace metals, and dissolved oxygen. Currently, there is no way to measure these compounds in real-time at aircraft-relevant conditions or determine the onset of thermal instability. Mainstream Engineering proposes a spectroscopic approach using solid-state, fiber-coupled components to determine bulk properties and trace indicators of thermal oxidation through chemometric analysis. Phase I will result in a high-fidelity integration of components in the laboratory. Phase II will include testing a prototype demonstrator on the Advanced Reduced Scale Fuel System Simulator as well as development and execution of technology transition strategy.; BENEFIT: Next-generation aircraft will require thermal management systems (TMSs) capable of dissipating thermal loads of 100s to 1000s of kilowatts. These thermal loads exceed the capacity of current tactical aircraft TMSs. The proposed fuel condition monitor (FCM) will extend the capability next-generation TMSs that sink heat to the fuel, thereby supporting the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) initiative. TheFCM will support future military and military aircraft. The underlying technology also has applications for ground-based fuel testing. Mainstream Engineering, a two-time Tibbetts Award winner with a 95% commercialization achievement index, is well-poised to commercialize this technology having brought over 30 commercial and military products to the market."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A major challenge in developing air-breathing engines for high speed flight is the high temperature of the air that is ingested at high Mach numbers. Precooler heat exchangers in front of the fan have been attempted at various times since the 1960s, but none of these concepts have ever flown. SPIRITECH proposes an innovative annular precooler heat exchanger to cool propulsion system inlet air at high Mach numbers to simulate the lower temperature flow conditions associated with lower Mach flight. This innovative precooler allows use of current-technology turbojet engines to facilitate high speed flight. This system employs low temperature helium in a precooler\/heat exchanger to chill the incoming air. Unique features of the precooler include: 1) lightweight construction techniques to facilitate high internal pressures in a lightweight design, 2) counterflow flow arrangement with aspects of crossflow added to enhance heat transfer and, ultimately, precooler effectiveness, and 3) unique shaping of tube bundles to provide improved cooling effectiveness while minimizing pressure drop. In addition, use of additive manufacturing for the headers\/manifolds allows them to be integrated efficiently into the overall precooler design, which is expected to provide benefits in weight, cost, and integration.; BENEFIT: The development of precooled propulsion is a key enabler for new high Mach platform capabilities of particular interest to the Air Force. The ability to achieve high speed flight using a gas turbine engine with a precooler would be a major game-changer in high speed flight. If successful, this market could explode with demand for aircraft and missiles. In addition, technologies derived from this precooler concept could be used to replace heat exchangers on the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B), and the Sixth-Generation Jet Fighter, to name a few. Potential customers in this field include both military and commercial customers. Military customers include Air Force, Navy, Army, NASA and DARPA. Commercial customers include aircraft, propulsion, automotive, and power generation companies, as well as any company that uses heat exchangers to cool components."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) has developed a novel heat exchanger based on the mathematical concept of fractal branching. The branching structure allows the heat exchanger to discard much of the weight that other designs require for flow manifolds and structural support. The new heat exchanger is more efficient and light enough to use on an airplane engine.When used on a high speed (Mach 4) airplane, the heat exchanger allows use of current engine technology via pre-cooling. Pre-cooling is cooling of the engines intake charge to allow operation at higher speeds than would normally be possible.Initial analysis indicates that the PSI heat exchanger can reduce temperatures sufficiently to enable existing engines such as the F-119 to greatly expand their operating envelope to Mach 4. System performance is increased; development cost of a high speed engine will also be reduced by reliance on proven designs.A test article will be produced with heat transfer rate of 30 kW\/lbm, and future research could produce power-to-weight ratios of 100 kW\/lbm or more. These weight reductions are a major improvement over the 8 kW\/lbm state of the art. This advance is made possible through new numerical optimization techniques and additive manufacturing of metals.; BENEFIT: A major potential benefit of this research is for existing engine designs to be operable at speeds of Mach 4 or greater. Existing gas turbine engines are normally only operable up to Mach 2, with some advanced designs going to Mach 3.2 or so. Re-use of existing designs and design methodology would save development time and cost for high speed propulsion, and increase efficiency of high speed airplanes.The light weight geometry pursued by PSI is also applicable to recuperation of gas turbines and intercooling of internal combustion engines, two major areas of potential efficiency increase for airplanes, helicopters, and ground vehicles. The approach pursued in this research can also be applied to super-compact heat exchangers for electronics and micro engines."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Hypersonic vehicles have the capability to provide the United States Air Force with the mission capabilities needed to meet their core missions of air and space superiority, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), rapid global mobility, global strike, and command and control.Current hypersonic vehicles require a first stage to propel the aircraft to flight speeds and a second stage to maintain speed.The combination of these stages increases complexity of the vehicle and reduces the mission readiness of the vehicle.To reduce complexity, a single propulsion system that can propel the aircraft from takeoff to flight speed is required to meet this goal with turbojet engines being the most conducive to this task.However, due to the high stagnation temperature at flight speeds above Mach 2, the turbojet engine cannot sustain hypersonic flight without a precooler heat exchanger to reduce the temperature of the inlet air to the turbojet engine.Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc., in collaboration with GoHypersonic, Inc. propose to develop a compact, lightweight, precooler to enable turbojet propulsion from takeoff to hypersonic speeds.During the Phase I effort, ACT and GHI will design and evaluate the proposed heat exchanger system and its impact on vehicle performance.; BENEFIT: The proposed heat exchanger technology will provide the heat rejection necessary to enable turbojet propulsion systems in hypersonic vehicles and increase the mission readiness and capability of hypersonic vehicles for defense applications.If successful, the proposed heat exchanger technology, developed by Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc., will be licensed to GoHypersonic, Inc. for fabrication and integration into hypersonic vehicles."

(SEI) seeks government support for the development of an automated tool for generating, assessing, and optimizing traditional and novel propulsion-power-thermal (PPT) architectures with applications ranging from high-speed aviation to space access. Once fully enabled, the fast-running, multi-platform tool will utilize an expert system, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), to construct candidate PPT systems based on user-specified requirements and desirements.; BENEFIT: It is anticipated that the demand for the commercial sale of this product will be very strong. For most aerospace transportation systems, the main propulsion system is both a major cost and schedule driver. By using this tool early in the vehicle design process, aerospace companies could greatly reduce their propulsion development cost and time by identifying the most promising propulsion system cycle early in the design phase."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To engineer the next generation of aerospace systems will require investigation into novel propulsion system architectures that are designed with consideration of the power and thermal management systems.This paradigm shift from the traditional watershed design process to an integrated systems design process will be enabled by the development of new early stage analysis and design tools.PC Krause and Associates (PCKA) proposes to develop a propulsion architecture rapid synthesis and evaluation (PARSE) tool.The PARSE tool will 1) automatically synthesize propulsion architectures, 2) evaluate performance of candidate architectures, and 3) searches the design space of potential architectures to identify the optimal architecture for a given mission and set of constraints.This will be accomplished by a 2 stage co-design process which optimizes both the architecture performance and architecture design.The advantage of this methodology is that it enables the comparison of different architectures on the basis of their best case performance.To overcome the long execution time of the 2 stage optimization, PCKA will utilize their FastSim and Distributed Heterogeneous Simulation tools to enable distributed computing.For Phase I of this proposal PCKA will develop the PARSE tool and demonstrate its effectiveness through a representative simulation case study.; BENEFIT: The near term commercial opportunities targeted by this SBIR are DoD agencies and prime contractors working on next generation aerospace system design.The PARSE tool offers several benefits, including (1) a systematic process for automatically synthesizing propulsion architectures, (2) a 2 stage co-design process which simultaneously optimizes the architecture design and operation, and (3) enhanced insight into why an architecture performs the best for a chosen mission and set of constraints.Together, these features will enable designers to find novel propulsion architectures that can satisfy mission requirements, as well as constraints imposed by the power and thermal management systems.In addition to the direct benefits to the DoD, there is potential for application, with minor adaptation, to other markets, such as NASA."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Modern tactical and commercial aircraft are now dependent on the liquid fuel entering the engine as a primary heat sink for cooling critical engine, power generation and actuation components. The civilian-class fuels being used have an inherently greater variability in thermal properties such as specific heat, which can result in less cooling to critical components or degradation of the fuel itself. A critical need exists for a modeling and simulation tool that can statistically address in the design process the effect of fuel property variations on aircraft thermal management systems.CFDRC proposes to integrate an existing proven fluid flow network solver with a package of statistical and optimization tools to create the PFSS (Probabilistic Fluid System Software) package.During Phase I, CFDRC will conduct preliminary validation against relevant test data.By Phase I conclusion, collaborating with OEM partners, PFSS will have been used to simulate a simplified tactical aircraft mission.In the Phase II program, CFDRC will work with Air Force personnel to build a detailed model of components in the ARSFSS test rig and perform detailed code validation.The software tool will be the basis for future R&amp;D to incorporate additional thermal effects such as in-line oxidation and coking.; BENEFIT: Benefits to the Air Force will be increased aircraft uptime, lower maintenance costs and operation for extended periods of time in extreme temperature conditions due to better understanding of the thermal management system.Pioneering military applications will lead to future civilian work, and CFDRC will pursue opportunities with aircraft manufacturers and engine OEMs.CFDRC will work to transition the PFSS modeling and simulation approach to other aerospace applications, and even commercial industry and manufacturing environments."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Modern military aircraft have major thermal challenges as a result of significant increases to on-board heat generation combined with reduced ability to transfer heat to the ambient environment.Adaptive power and thermal management systems are being explored to mitigate the thermal restrictions. These systems rely on fuel as a primary heat sink but analysis of system performance is based on standard fluid property definitions that may contain as much as 15% error from real-world applications. The impacts of this fuel to fuel variability are not well understood at a system level and the sensitivity of system performance must therefore be explored.The primary objective of the Phase I will be the development of an analysis capability for studying the impacts of fuel to fuel variability on system level performance. This analysis capability will then be verified through integrated system studies with results documented. The outcome of these studies will include enhancement to existing integration toolsets and documentation of system level results, both of which will be disseminated to the broader community to improve industry wide analysis capability for current and future programs.; BENEFIT: The ability to analyze system level sensitivity to fuel to fuel variability offers several benefits to the Air Force Research Laboratory, including: (1) reduced cost through model-based design, (2) reduced risk through sensitivity analysis at conceptual design, (3) reduced risk when considering alternative fuel types, (4) optimization capability through understanding performance improvements as a result of fuel property variation, and (5) improved analysis capability for current and next generation platforms.In addition to the direct benefits to the Air Force Research Laboratory, there are potential customers of such capability in the aerospace community on both commercial and military platforms.The ability to understand impacts from fuel to fuel property variability at a system level provides a greater insight into the risk associated with a given design that was heretofore unobtainable. The proposed effort can be used to both identify risk and optimization opportunities on current and next generation aircraft."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A valve is needed to operate the Air Forces Ludwieg wind tunnel.The valve must open full bore without obstructions to avoid shedding vortices that would disturb experiments in the downstream Mach 6 flow field.Safes design uses the Geneva mechanism and a weight-optimized ball valve to open in 33 msec.The Geneva mechanisms input sector accelerates to a high speed before engaging the output sector to turn the ball a precise number of degrees and hold it in position.The input sector disengages from the ball and decelerates afterward.Safe has developed a detailed dynamic simulation of the valves motion to demonstrate that the opening time can be achieved with practical selections for hydraulic fluid pressures, piston areas, and other operating variables.The ball mass is validated with structural analysis showing acceptable stress when holding against the full stored air pressure.An innovative seal prevents leakage past the valve while avoiding wear during operation.The technical approach includes the required tests of a manufactured prototype.Safes team has an expert in valve design with prior experience developing fast acting valves.The commercialization strategy is flexible and has been used to commercialize past SBIR technology.; BENEFIT: The benefit of the fast-acting valve is its ability to maximize the time that can be devoted to experiments in a clean and steady field of Mach 6 flow.It can be used repeatedly for a design life of 50,000 cycles with a quick turnaround time between tests.The Air Force will be able to conduct more experiments within a given test period, where each experiment uses more of the available 200 msec test time.Aside from operating Ludwieg tube wind tunnels, the valve may find other applications where fast action is needed; for example, to rapidly dump liquid sodium coolant into a nuclear reactor for emergency shutdown, where the extra milliseconds of response time may be beneficial to safety.The valve might also aid wind blast testing, such as at NAVAIRs facility which simulates the effects of the wind on a person in an ejection seat during a high speed (600 knots equivalent air speed) aircraft ejection.The speed of items ejected from gas guns, such as carcasses for aircraft bird strike testing, depends on the opening speed of the valve. Fast closing valves (the inverse of the design to be developed here) are used in explosion containment systems in many industries."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: With hypersonic research becoming increasingly relevant, as viable technologies encroach on these speeds, heightened emphasis is being placed on effective methodologies of simulating hypersonic airflows. Specifically, Ludwieg Tubes have distinguished themselves as an effective and economical way to terrestrially produce hypersonic flow. In attempt to further increase their utility, researchers are seeking innovative valve solutions to initiate Ludwieg Tube discharge, thereby replacing traditional burst diaphragms.Mainstream Engineering proposes to develop a novel fast-actuating valve that will provide for easier operation and reduced down-time between testing. The Phase I work plan, presented in this proposal, details the fabrication and validation of a proprietary valve design for the AFRL Mach 6 wind tunnel. This valve will repeatedly seal against 600 psi air, at 450 F, while being able to fully open in less than 50 ms. Furthermore, the proposed valve will be designed to operate reliably for 50,000 Ludwieg Tube cycles. Upon successful completion of Phase I, Mainstream will scale-up its valve design in Phase II, for integration into the future University of Notre Dame Mach 6 wind tunnel. Mainstream has proven its effectiveness as an SBIR contractor with a successful track record of commercializing products over the past 30 years.; BENEFIT: Mainstreams fast-valve is a simple design that provides for increased operational efficiency of any blowdown or Ludwieg Tube hypersonic wind tunnel. Once validated in Phase I and Phase II wind tunnel applications, the proprietary Mainstream valve design can be easily integrated into any existing or future design that requires repetitive fast actuation of a high-enthalpy gas. Such industry demand could include the expanded high-speed wind tunnel community, oil and natural gas, gas gun applications, and bulk solid pneumatic conveyance."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: AOSense proposes to design, build, and deliver an atomic inertial measurement unit (IMU) for aircraft navigation. The proposed sensor will be integrated into an 8 liter physics package and delivered with a 3U rack mount controller for laboratory testing and field demonstrations. To guide the sensor design, tests will be performed in Phase I using existing hardware coupled with novel data acquisition strategies for improved long-term stability. The packaged device will be built and tested in Phase II prior to delivery to the government for independent testing and\/or a field demonstration. Such a device could greatly reduce the reliance on GPS for aircraft navigation.; BENEFIT: Inertial navigation systems are a key DOD asset for cases in which GPS is either unavailable or actively denied. Defense systems such as aircrafts, ballistic missiles, submarines, and spacecraft all rely critically on inertial measurement units to aid or provide positioning. Atom-optical inertial sensors have demonstrated superior performance over conventional inertial devices owing to the intrinsic stability of the atom and have the potential to transform precision navigation and guidance. While our target application for the SBIR is aircraft, once the technology is demonstrated, we can modify the design to accommodate a variety of SWaP and performance levels that would enable many applications ranging from missile to submarine navigation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Embedded systems vastly outnumber conventional computing platforms such as enterprise servers and personal computers. Many applications of embedded systems are critical to national security and personal safety. However, the level of security provided by the embedded systems is embarrassingly low: researchers successfully compromised embedded systems that control cars, medical devices, voting machines, smart televisions, internet phones, and many others. This lapse in security is caused, in part, by difficulties in developing and testing of embedded software: embedded platforms are much more diverse than desktop and server ones, have more stringent operational requirements, often have detailed timing constraints, and communicate with a wide range of physical peripheral devices. While the importance of functional testing for embedded systems is well-understood, this diversity makes testing for anomalous out-of-band behavior that creates security vulnerabilities much more difficult than for desktop applications.We propose a tool for conducting large-scale, massively-parallel testing of embedded-system software for security problems. The tool will combine systematic automated test generation with full-system emulation based on an industrial strength simulator. Automated test generation will systematically explore and exercise program behaviors, including unexpected behaviors that often harbor security vulnerabilities. Emulation will enable the tool to perform large-scale, massively parallel testing effectively.; BENEFIT: GrammaTechs overall vision is to provide a tool for conducting large-scale, massively-parallel testing of embedded-system software for security problems. The tool will combine automated test generation with full-system emulation based on an industrial strength simulator, identifying test runs with potential vulnerabilities. The company already markets static analysis tools, enabling teams to identify software application weaknesses, and developers of embedded system software are GrammaTechs largest market. The proposed testing tool fits perfectly with our existing static analysis solutions, extending our software assurance portfoliohelping identify issues using both static and dynamic techniques.The primary target market for the proposed technology is cyber-physical systems (CPS) and safety and security-critical software development organizations, supporting both government and commercial applications. The testing solution provides new capability required for efficient embedded software validation, identifying critical defects and vulnerabilities that could be exploited in todays highly connected embedded and machine-to-machine (M2M) devices.This is the same market space that is addressed by GrammaTechs existing software assurance products.We believe the market is in need of a testing platform that can perform large-scale, massively parallel testing without the need to acquire and configure expensive hardware, relying on sound simulations on general purpose computing clusters, such as Amazon EC2."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address embedded software security challenges found in Cyber Physical Systems, we propose to build a Detecting Embedded Vulnerabilities in Software (DEVIS) toolkit that employs dynamic binary analysis in a manner that (1) better manages the resources of the target system and software being executed, (2) determines and ranks the severity of vulnerabilities found, and (3) targets hardware instruction sets independent of the operating system. The solution uses a combination of selective symbolic execution and taint analysis to determine whether or not a specific vulnerability resides along the path to the state in question. DEVIS then employs an enhanced constraint solver) that uses the dynamic binary analysis-in-the-loop to search for paths that result in severe or high priority vulnerabilities. As results are executed by dynamic binary analysis, metrics for each path will be gathered based on the vulnerability found and the amount of memory and computing power used when detecting it. Next, DEVIS will work with the a constraint solver to determine which paths result in efficient or optimal resource allocation and the identification of the most severe vulnerabilities. Software targets from a variety of embedded processing environments will be used to test the results of DEVIS.; BENEFIT: This project will develop Detecting Embedded Vulnerabilities in Software (DEVIS), a solution for providing binary analysis for detecting security flaws in embedded cyber physical infrastructure supporting machinery and control systems. Such systems can be subverted by malicious insiders, external hackers and\/or supply chain threats. Additional security challenges include supply chain issues associated with counterfeit and foreign-developed or foreign-manufactured chipsets used in populating embedded systems. The DEVIS also addresses performance and computing resources challenges associated with the vulnerability detection process, which is a key technical challenge. DEVIS thus addresses the vulnerability management and device vulnerability assessment market segments.While this project is focused on machinery and control systems, the processes and techniques can be adopted to other Cyber Physical environments, including SCADA systems and Smart Grids. Power systems have borne the brunt of Cyber Physical attacks including the Shamoon, Duqu, Flame and Stuxnet viruses that have been used to bring down foreign power generation and refining systems. Adapting DEVIS for power generation enables us to target a fast growing market with known, well-documented problems with cyber attacks. According to a Zpryme Research study, the market for smart grid cyber is expected to grow to $7.25B by 2020. Leading vendors include BAE Systems, IOActive, IBM, Lockheed Martin, ABB Ltd., Siemens, Schneider Electric, Honeywell, Rockwell Automation, GE, and Invensys. RAM Laboratories already has working relationships in place with several of these organizations."

AM also provides the ability for combined parts manufacture and the ability to include additional functionality into parts.For example, parts will be fabricated with high-Z materials to improve the radiation shielding effectiveness of systems as well as materials to improve the EMI\/HPM shielding effectiveness. Finally, parts can be fabricated as a single unit as opposed to multiple pieces\/materials which require assembly. Complete single component end item manufacturing provides savings by reducing labor and materials costs while offering operational benefits by reducing maintenance through lower parts count, easier acquisition of spares, and reduced system weight."

Finally, at the end of Phase I the research team will produce an ICBM component with integrated radiation shielding, provided by Lockheed Martin, to complete a hardware demo of our functionally graded alloy system on a part relevant to ICBM programs.; BENEFIT: This project will create new additive manufacturing (AM) processes for producing high temperature ICBM components with integrated radiation shielding, via selective laser melting (SLM).Benefits include:1) High-to-low-Z graded alloy AM for the first time, via SLM and in situ alloy development.2) Lightweight materials graded to refractory metals create high-temperature structural parts with integrated radiation shielding.3) Reduced mass and cost of ICBM components through the elimination of added radiation shielding.4) Assemblies normally manufactured as separate components can be built as a single unit.5) Reduced maintenance through lower part count6) Spares can be manufactured in an on-demand basis.7) Cross-cutting technology can be used for other DoD applications, such as shaped-charge liners, and for medical devices.Future research (Phase II) will see the graded alloy AM process automated with a multi-material hopper system for powder delivery to the build point.This process is also easily portable to larger commercial style SLM systems, so commercialization is likely.The graded alloy fabrication developed here may also be useful for reverse-engineering and building improved ICBM components on current platforms. Commercial applications of this technology are very promising.Our current proposal has two letters of support from different commercial partners.First is Lockheed Martin who plans to use this technology for their ICBM systems.The second is Battelle, a prime contractor for the Army who produce shaped-charge liners for explosive munitions.They are highly interested in this technology, they plan to build functionally graded shaped charge liners to improve armor piercing capability, thus improving the capability of the American warfighter on the ground.A third promising application is medical device, here there is significant interest in using functionally graded alloys to improve arterial stent delivery, as well as other uses.Resonetics, a subcontractor on this project intends to commercialize this technology for this purpose."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Next generation satellite communication systems must be robust to hostile jammers which degrade link budget and desensitize reception. A proposed solution is to use frequency hopping techniques to communicate in a spectrum space free of hostile jammers and an all digital radio in which the agility and robustness is provided by the data-converters. To this end, broadband high dynamic range data-converters are needed to cover the broad-spectrum of interest allowing for frequency hopping. To meet this demand, MaXentric proposes to implement the L-band data-converters in a RADHARD SOI process (such as Honeywell or STmirco) meeting stringent space radiation specifications. The ADC will use time-interleaving for speed enhancement, low-jitter clock generation for improved ENOB, and linear sampling techniques with calibration to meet SFDR. For the DAC, previous expertise in high-speed high power digital envelope tracking PAs will be leveraged creating a dual technology based DAC (CMOS-SOI and GaN) for speed and output power.; BENEFIT: All digital approaches for transceivers in which the design performance is mainly leveraged on the data-converters are becoming wide-spread for various applications. The technology developed under the L-band Data-converter program has various applications, not just for DoD. In particular, all digital radar and phased arrays for imaging in auto-motive collision avoidance has become a high topic of interest and leverage an array of high speed data-converters for each antenna element. Future 5G technology, moreover, will likely heavily depend on digital phased array technology to increase data rates, the number of users, and improve link budget. All of these techniques require high speed, high ENOB, high SFDR, and low power data-converters. An identified potential costumer of the L-band data-converter technology developed would be NXPa leader in development of RADAR automotive chipsets."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Recent advancements in commercial high-speed Analog to Digital (ADC) and Digital to Analog (DAC) data converters have enabled increasingly capable microwave communication architectures, including efficient, fast-hopping digital receivers and transmitters.These new communication architectures can perform direct digitization of the entire L band, providing significantly greater speed, precision, and flexibility of frequency-hopping due to the ability to digitally down-convert and discriminate many multiple bands from a single wideband RF signal.In addition, these architectures provide significant reduction and simplification of exotic and expensive analog RF system components.Although commercial devices exist that may meet the electrical requirements of the program, these devices are designed, fabricated, and\/or sold by foreign owned companies.Our partner, Honeywell Aerospace, a DoD Trusted supplier, is chosen specifically to address tamper and counterfeit device concerns.We propose to develop a high speed, radiation-hardened ADC to be implemented in existing fabrication processes and produced on-shore in a trusted semiconductor foundry to meet the data conversion needs of the Air Force and other military\/aerospace system developers.The capabilities described in this SBIR proposal will provide direct, significant benefits to satellite communications and other space-borne applications by addressing the demanding requirements on performance, size, weight, and power.; BENEFIT: Successful completion of the three-phase efforts briefly outlined in this proposal will result in a fully qualified, radiation hardened 12 bit, 2.4 Gsps L-Band ADC device from a trusted supply source to satisfy system needs for signal processing.Within the radiation hardened electronics user base, there is a ready market for technology innovations that offer advanced, capable, and reliable radiation hardened devices to address critical component requirements for a wide range of defense, aerospace, and space science applications.This device will have relevance to defense, aerospace, and space science markets with significance to satellite (including micro\/nano-satellite), missile defense, and other strategic defense systems.Specific applications for this device will include flight and ground uplink\/downlink terminals, as well as navigation, communication, command and control, and data acquisition for interceptors, defense and commercial satellites, other space flight systems, and radar\/antenna arrays.Scientics commercialization strategy seeks to leverage Honeywells unique marketplace position and knowledge, as well as their integration, fabrication, and distribution expertise to establish a market basis for development and fabrication of the proposed ADC.This approach has particular advantage with respect to risk reduction, product financing, market penetration, market credibility, manufacturing, production, and distribution.Upon successful completion of this program, Honeywell will be the primary source of production for this device.Honeywell has the capacity to produce and deliver thousands of devices per year.Members of our team have successfully developed numerous advanced radiation hardened devices for space and strategic applications in the past, including a 12 bit, 20 Msps ADC currently used to support Trident and multiple other programs, a 14 bit, 125 Msps ADC currently undergoing QML qualification, and a 10 Gbps multi-protocol SerDes transceiver.Our team is currently working to develop a radiation hardened 12 bit, 4.8 Gsps direct digital synthesis (DDS) DAC under an AF phase I SBIR.We intend to leverage the knowledge and appropriate technology developments gained during that program to support the DAC efforts proposed herein.Commercialization will also be enhanced by both Honeywells and Scientics experience in the radiation hardened technology market.Both corporations routinely participate in and support defense and industry conferences, seminars, and symposia which serve to highlight ongoing research efforts and advances in technologies. The Scientic\/Honeywell team will seek to enhance community awareness by presenting at these conferences as progress warrants.Scientic personnel, along with our technology partners, have extensive experience in the DoD market area.This experience has been gained over many years while working at this and previous corporations, both large and small, bringing sophisticated technology to the defense marketplace. For example, working in close cooperation with organizations such as Honeywell Aerospace, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Aeroflex, and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), we have developed and brought to market a number of radiation-hardened electronic devices.In addition Scientic personnel have established working relationships with defense component suppliers such as Kearfott for IMU technology and Rockwell Collins for missile defense interceptor communications applications.Scientic personnel currently support and have historically supported organizations such as the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC), US Navy, and others.As we proceed, we will seek to determine potential applications\/needs within these organizations which could be satisfied by our proposed technology.With this in mind, and where warranted, a portion of Phase III support may be sought from other Government sources which are determined to have requirements that could be satisfied by this technology."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Interleaving ADCs and DACs is a common method to achieve high conversion rates. Interleaving is traditioinally accomplished through high speed switching within a single integrated circuit. Using electrical engineering theory and digital signal processing, circuit taps can enable external interleaving to be accomplished in the time domain. This circuit tap approach permits lower speed converters to be connected to high speed signals without sacrificing signal integrity while enabling the lower speed parts to convert the high speed signals.; BENEFIT: This research will create a conceptual design that can be immediately applied in the characterization of a novel AFRL payload. This SBIR would advance existing plans and provide a new capability in the small satellite community. This hardware also has obvious applications in alternate markets such as satellite ground stations and antenna measurement and test."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Detecting and locating Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammers is a vital part of navigation warfare (Navwar), comprising the major thrust of Navwar Electronic Support (ES).The objective of this SBIR effort is to develop a ground-based GNSS Jammer Location capability capable of estimating the position of a GNSS jammer within 100 meters, and estimating jammer position within 10 meters when networked with other sensors.Under this effort we shall develop a design for a networked GNSS jammer locator suitable for detecting jammer signals operating on any of the GNSS frequencies which leverages fielded tactical radios in ground vehicles for data collection and networking.We shall investigate methods of creating observations that can distinguish between direct and multipath signal paths between the SDR units and the jammer to allow for precision geolocation of jammers and shall demonstrate through simulation the ability to provide precision jammer location using a combination of collaborative data sharing, within the bandwidth constraints of a tactical network, and onboard processing of the jammer signal. A plan will be developed to build and test a brassboard prototype GNSS jammer locator under Phase II for testing in laboratory and controlled field environments.; BENEFIT: Effective jammer detection and location 1) enables alternative means to mitigate jamming (such as kinetic attack), 2) supports mission planning, and 3) increases situational awareness.The proposed collaborative jammer location (JLOC) solution provides a ground-based mobile capability to effectively detect and locate GNSS jammers at the tactical edge greatly increasing an operational teams ability to deter jamming attacks.The GNSS JLOC network technology is designed to transition into operation as a software application running on fielded tactical radios providing GNSS jammer situational awareness throughout mission execution."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Civilian and military systems worldwide have become dependent on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). Hence, the detection, identification, and geolocalization of jammers that disrupt GNSS signals have become increasingly important for electronic protection (EP) and electronic support (ES) measures. While multipath has traditionally been an enemy of GNSS signals, it also has the potential to assist in geolocalization and enabling single-receiver systems in locating jammers without external assistance, thereby lowering the required resources to localize radio-frequency (RF) emitters.During this proposed effort, Toyon will leverage our direction-finding and multipath-mitigating hardware to harness multipath for the purpose of geolocating RF emitter sources, particularly in the L band. During the Phase I effort, Toyon will develop the required algorithms and models, conduct experiments with actual hardware, and verify simulated experiments with measured data. A prototype system design will be developed during the Phase I effort, and fabricated and demonstrated during the Phase II program.; BENEFIT: The ability of a single receiver to geolocate GNSS jammers will significantly reduce the resources necessary to locate RF jammers. A system that is capable of multipath-exploitation to improve localization performance, together with the ability to provide direction-finding (DF) and position, velocity, attitude, and time (PVAT) can be used by both civilian and military operators. The system can be used for both navigation and for jammer hunting and has applications under the FAA and FCC, as well as for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) where there is a growing concern of the disruption of our nations power grid due intentional interference."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the Air Force need for a cognitive UHF radio for enhanced Global Positioning System (GPS) crosslinks, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Cognitive Radio-Based UHF\/VHF Crosslink Enhancement for Satellites (CRUCES). This proposed CRUCES solution is based on a novel architecture incorporating POCs dynamic spectrum access (DSA) techniques with wideband radio frequency (RF) interference mitigation and spectrum sensing capabilities. Specifically, the CRUCES network architecture will enable GPS inter satellite data transfer with an average data rate up to 2 Mbps using existing UHF\/VHF non-directional antennas. Wideband UHF\/VHF spectrum sensing and interference mitigation techniquesspecifically designed to operate in a congested, contested RF environmentprovide the basis of a dynamic frequency selection (DFS) approach that will ensure that the GPS crosslinks do not interfere with other users in the band, which directly addresses the Air Force requirements for an advanced VHF\/UHF inter-satellite radio network for GPS autonomous navigation and real-time command and control (C2). In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of a CRUCES architecture, operational concept, and preliminary design, through modeling, simulation, and experimental test setups. In Phase II, POC will demonstrate enhanced UHF\/VHF crosslinks with brassboard hardware and simulated interference environment.; BENEFIT: The primary application of CRUCES will be to low size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) crosslinks for military and commercial satellite networks. In addition to the future GPS satellites, other potential military platforms for the CRUCES technology may include the Mobile Objective User System (MUOS), Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF). Numerous civilian satellite networks, such as Iridium, could benefit from the CRUCES crosslink technology. The CRUCES technology can be extended beyond crosslinks usage to provide enhanced uplink and downlink rates to ground users once regulatory bodies relax the restrictions on secondary users operating on a non-interference basis throughout the UHF\/VHF spectrum. The CRUCES technology may also be readily adapted to non-space applications. Femto-cells in cellular networks can benefit from the CRUCES versatile, high throughput, spectrally-efficient capability to maintain high-bandwidth data transfer in spectrally-congested environments. Local law enforcement, first responders, and rescue units can benefit from integration of the CRUCES technology into multiband radios, ensuring reliable communications between team members in emergency situations."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The accuracy and robustness of the GPS satellite constellation is tied to the ability of the satellites to communicate among themselves via their crosslink intersatellite network to implement Autonav functionality and to propagate commands and updates from the ground control segment.The current UHF-based crosslink suffers in performance due to interference from terrestrial UHF spectrum users, and the GPS constellations status as a secondary spectrum user.Application of innovative spectrum sensing techniques combined with efficient frequency-agile spectrum allocation protocols can make optimal use of current UHF frequencies without generating interference for primary spectrum users.Emerging digital radio frequency (RF) technologies, including latest space-capable field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and wideband data converters, can be leveraged to implement this dynamic spectrum access capability affordably in a small size, weight, and power footprint.Trident Systems (Fairfax, VA) proposes to leverage our strong background in programmable FPGA-based wideband digital RF transceivers, advanced self-forming data networks, and space-oriented architectures to develop a Dynamic Spectrum Crosslink Transceiver (DSCT).With support from key industry partners, Trident will implement a DSCT prototype capability through a comprehensive Phase I program of requirements analysis, modeling and simulation, and preliminary design, followed by prototype implementation in Phase II.; BENEFIT: The successful implementation of the Dynamic Spectrum Crosslink Transceiver will enable a more robust crosslink capability for current- and next-generation GPS satellites without requiring complete replacement of UHF-based RF signal chains and antennas.This will in turn lead to more accurate and reliable autonomous navigation performance of the GPS constellation, as well as more reliable propagation of command segment updates.Tridents modular approach to DSCT implementation will also make the proposed solution applicable to alternate crosslink frequency bands and RF front ends, as well as other space-based data communications network applications requiring high reliability and high performance."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In this work we propose an integrated Finite Set Statistical (FISST) and hierarchical reasoning filtering solution to enable rapid catalog processing and object characterization for threat indication and warning. The solution relies on defining a hybrid discrete-continuous relational state between an asset and all potentially threatening space objects, and then applied to all assets. Given existing representative catalog, and raw sensor and other soft data, FISST allows for the extraction of the most amount of information contained in the data. This allows for a more accurate catalog processor leading to more rapid object assessment and characterization. Such accuracy and rapidity aids in faster and more accurate threat indications and warning. The proposed solution is probabilistically rigorous, scalable and can be implemented in real-time.; BENEFIT: This Phase I effort will be foundational to future work efforts by establishing a working prototype that exercises a variety of new probabilistically rigorous and scalable hybrid filtering techniques for threat indications and warning.It will begin with the divergence from the standard paradigm, where catalog processing is completely divorced from object characterization and vice-versa, into a functioning, scalable and rapid tool for threat indications and warning.This paradigm change is essential to evolve to higher levels of rapid object characterization and potentially orders of magnitude improvement in threat indication and warning.The prototype developed in this effort will demonstrate how to effectively implement the innovative FISST methodology in an ARCADE SOA environment.The inherent capabilities of FISST and hierarchical reasoning, in regards to probabilistic and confidence calculations, may then be exercised within the ARCADE and intelligence community counterparts to evaluate how they can influence operational commanders perspective on SSA.Finally, this work would demonstrate a viable set of SOA-available inference algorithms that are sensor and data type agnostic, real-time responsive, and scalable enough to support the massive new data rates of systems (e.g. Lockheed Space Fence) that the JMS will acquire in next few years.This project would set the ground work for a series of technologies that could significantly increase the capabilities of the JSpOC\/JMS to help achieve their missions in SSA, Force Protection, and Combat Identification."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: According to the U.S. National Space Policy, &quot;The United States will invest in space situational awareness capabilities and launch vehicle technologies; develop the means to assure mission essential functions enabled by space; enhance our ability to identify and characterize threats; and deter, defend, and if necessary, defeat efforts to interfere with or attack U.S. or allied space systems.&quot; To identify and characterize threats, the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) must maintain custody of current space objects, as well as characterize and catalog new objects as they are launched.Large upcoming constellations of satellites planned by commercial entities make the pace of space population unprecedented.As multi-payload launches become the norm, robust tracking, correlation, cataloging and identification is more critical than ever.Without an automated system, valuable indications and warnings (I&amp;W) cannot be issued to protect U.S. and allied assets from environment and adversary threats.There are multiple algorithms that correlate observations to ballistic objects.However, the ability to autonomously associate measurements across multiple days with maneuvering spacecraft is still an unsolved problem, let alone coupling this software with apriori information for I&amp;W alerts.To meet this need, ExoAnalytic Solutions intends to develop C3PO:&quot;Correlation and Characterization for Catalog Processing.&quot;; BENEFIT: ExoAnalytic&apos;s C3PO effort is significant because it will provide the ability to rapidly and autonomously correlate objects and provide I&amp;W using commercial and SSN observations and Intelligence data on High-Interest Objects (HIO).ExoAnalytic intends to bring correlation of maneuvering spacecraft, initial orbit determination, and I&amp;W alerts together in a single autonomous software suite.The benefit to the warfighter is giving a JSpOC user more information about potentially volitle space objects in a much more timely fashion than ever before.While the user may continue to perform analysis by hand prior to adding object to the catalog, the user will have access to more data about the object to begin their analysis.C3PO will alert the JMS operator by an appropriate number and severity of I&amp;W messages to prevent user overload and high false alarm rates, allowing the user to prioritize and focus on threat concerns by likelihood and consequence.With the overwhelming amount of data that comes from the SSN and new non-traditional sources, algorithms that minimize manual human interaction will better support timely awareness and Course of Action (COA) decisions with regards to threats to critical space assets.The commercial application of C3PO is to integrate with the JSpOC Mission Systems (JMS) after successful demonstration within the Air Force Research Laboratory&apos;s (AFRL) Advanced Research, Collaboration, and Application Development Environment (ARCADE).Aside from integrating C3PO into JMS, ExoAnalytic would anticipate this effort would open the door to opportunities to support JMS on Increment 3 activities.Additionally, this technology would also be useful to domestic and international commercial space owners and operators.While spacecraft operators usually have good awareness of their spacecraft during normal operations, anomalous activities (e.g., space weather event, debris collision, on-orbit failure) with their asset or neighboring spacecraft leave them with very poor space situational awareness.C3PO can also support customers that are part of a multi-payload launch, since early knowledge of nearby objects is typically minimal."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes to develop a novel, and significantly lower cost approach for manufacturing lightweight thermal management solution to address the high heat flux and temperature of next generation GaN power amplifiers or phased arrays. Current power amplifiers are limited in output by the heat flux and temperature capabilities of the overall thermal management system. In order to enable higher output devices it is critical to reduce the heat flux on the thermal management system by spreading the heat efficiently across a larger area. The use of high-temperature electronics such as the next generation of GaN power amplifiers allows operation up to 150 C with adequate higher radiator temperatures and significantly smaller radiator size\/mass, due to the biquadratic nature of radiation heat transfer for heat rejection. A lightweight high temperature thermal management concept is proposed to minimize the resultant temperature drop such that the radiator size will further decrease, since the required thermal radiator panel size will be reduced at higher rejection temperature.; BENEFIT: All satellites will benefit from high temperature electronics by utilizing the biquadratic nature of radiation heat transfer to reduce radiator mass\/size such as systems that utilize phased arrays. Also, commercial spacecraft, aircraft, and ground vehicles will benefit through increased bandwidth and higher heat load\/power payloads. The proposed thermal management solution by ACT will permit the use of these high temperature electronics, which will be greatly simplifying thermal system design."

Key technical challenges will be identifying start-up, steady state and shutdown conditions for varying geometries and working fluid combinations. Successful research will conclude with high temperature prototypes that are thinner, lighter and of higher heat capacity than status quo thermal control technologies used in satellite systems. Lastly, the research team will work with agency and prime contractor subject matter experts to ensure Phase I designs and results are applicable to real-world satellite systems and operating conditions.; BENEFIT: This technology aims to relieve the thermal constraints that currently face high power density power amplifiers in space-based systems; however the results and findings will be useful to a wide range of military and commercial systems including radars, electronic warfare, broadband and telecommunications.

The jitter suppression utilizes an innovative algorithm for online robust background estimation which has been successfully demonstrated on OPIR data. Tracking is done using Arets proven Bayesian track-before-detect methodology, currently in operational use in a range of Defense and Intelligence applications. These algorithms are well-understood and known to be parallelizable. The proposed effort will produce an initial parallel implementation for GPU architecture in order to predict real-time computational performance in Phase II.; BENEFIT: The proposed algorithm suite leverages previous Government investments in detection, tracking, data conditioning, and pre-processing techniques for OPIR data to rapidly achieve the desired capability at low risk. In Phase I and Phase II, the advanced algorithms proposed here will be demonstrated in increasingly realistic settings. This validation will pave the way for integration into existing persistent infrared systems (e.g. NASICs ATEP II program) and future systems such as the AFRL \/ SMC WFOV payload and the next generation operational OPIR system. Other applications include image stabilization and tracking small objects in wide area motion imagery (WAMI) such as from unmanned aerial vehicles in defense and surveillance industries."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Toyon Research Corporation is proposing to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a suite of real-time algorithms for front-end exceedance generation for WFOV OPIR data. Persistent monitoring from infrared surveillance and staring systems is necessary for battlespace awareness and technical intelligence. However, persistent OPIR surveillance produces massive amounts of WFOV image data. To detect and track events of interest to the Air Force the data must first be pre-processed to remove focal plane array (FPA) noise, remove sensor motion jitter, remove background clutter, and reduce false alarms. Pre-processing is necessary for both automated and\/or man-in-the-loop analysis methods. Additionally, it is vital that pre-processing be performed in real-time to enable the Air Force to respond to potential threats. Large-format data collected for persistent WFOV applications poses a greater challenge for real-time processing. Toyons proposed algorithm suite includes novel, GPU accelerated, implementations for jitter suppression, clutter suppression, noise suppression, exceedance formatting, image windowing, and buffering and thresholding. The accelerated algorithms take advantage of parallelizable components in each process. To further increase efficiency, improvements in feature detection and tracking algorithms that make use of OPIR data constraints and accelerated versions of state-of-practice clutter suppression routines are proposed.; BENEFIT: The successful completion of this research and development effort will result in advanced, real-time algorithms for front-end exceedance generation of large-format image data. A direct application will be the insertion of these algorithms within baseline OPIR software for real-time processing at Air Force ground stations (such as Space and Missile Systems Center&apos;s Falcon Shield algorithm research facility), or technical intelligence labs (such as NASIC). The benefits of the proposed R&amp;D effort would be a comprehensive pre-processing algorithm suite which would increase the efficiency of detecting and tracking targets of interest as well as shorten the timeline needed for detecting and reacting to threats observed with OPIR sensors. This software could also be optimized for implementation by other agencies that use satellite sensors for surveillance to detect and locate new classes of potential threats in real-time. Furthermore, the algorithms described have the potential to be used onboard future platforms carrying SWIR sensors for persistent surveillance."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Etegent is proposing development against two algorithm areas from the solicitation, jitter suppression and clutter suppression.For the jitter suppression Etegent is proposing to apply their subpixel-resolution, scene-based cross correlation technique to measure in-scene jitter, combined with an image-filter based technique to reproject the images to a common alignment with minimal pixel spreading.Both techniques have performed well in past efforts and are highly optimized in the Matlab environment, but will require expansion to a GPU implementation and may require additional capability enhancement.For clutter suppression Etegent will apply a principal components background suppression (PCBS) algorithm.This too will be expanded to a GPU implementation, along with a number of candidate approximations to render it suitable for a real-time processing budget.Of course, these proposed techniques are a starting point; actual algorithm development will be guided by the needs of the furnished data sets and may change during the work.; BENEFIT: The research conducted under this Phase I effort will lay the groundwork for the fuller integration and testing of a set of real-time processing algorithms at the Space and Missile Systems Centers Falcon Shield algorithm research facility.These algorithms will be well vetted and should readily lead to real-time operation on off-the-shelf workstation class machines with advanced GPU capabilities.These algorithms will address two significant portions of the real-time processing chain, taking nearly raw sensor data and providing a cleaned up data stream with jitter effects mitigated and static background scene content removed.Etegent also sees potential for broader application within the intelligence community (e.g. NASIC, NGA) and in their own commercial software for nondestructive inspection data management (NLign)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The past decade has seen a proliferation of computing devices. A landscape once dominated by single core microprocessors has given way to a plethora of competing technologies including multicore x86, ARM, and Power-family processors, graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), Xeon Phis, DSPs, and TILE architectures, among others. Further complicating matters, each of these architectures often requires its own toolchain to work with. This makes it difficult to not only develop software that works across different devices, but to even determine what hardware would be best suited for a particular application. EM Photonics is currently developing a toolchain to address the first issue, namely the creation of programs that can be written once and targeted to different architectures. In this project, we propose expanding on this technology to allow the developer to work with a wider range of hardware devices as well as provide complementary analysis tools to help determine which hardware devices would be best suited for their applications. We will also create a new Matlab-like frontend for our toolchain to ease the burden on programmers already familiar with that paradigm.; BENEFIT: The tools developed in this project will be complementary to our effort in building tools that make it easier for the programmer to access the wide array of hardware that is now available. The work in this project will result in three specific benefits: 1) Make our cross-platform toolchain accessible to developers accustomed to working in Matlab, 2) In addition to current hardware options such as x86, ARM, GPU, etc., allow users programs to target more exotic architectures such as TILE, and 3) Provide additional tools that help the developer chose which hardware option is best suited for their application. Our target market for this work is developers looking to access the power of the multitude of available processing devices without having to learn and rewrite their software for each one. Instead, we are providing a toolchain that allows a program to be written one time in either a Matlab-based or C\/C++-style language, use analysis tools to project how it will perform on various devices, and build binaries for the platforms of interest. These tools will be marketed to the same user community we are approaching with the other development tools we are providing."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Efficient High Performance Embedded Computing (HPEC) benefits from a heterogeneous approach by leveraging a combination of CPUs, FPGAs, and GPUs.The challenge is trying to figure out which mix is optimal for a given application and developing re-useable code to take advantage of different processor combinations.A tool suite and design process is needed to assist a user with creating heterogeneous computing platforms.This methodology can either work to upgrade an existing system and\/or help the user create an entirely new high-performance computing platform optimized for a given application (such as OPIR).It provides a way to develop a solution meeting performance demands by modeling algorithmic performance on a heterogeneous platform.Colorado Engineering Inc., through its strategic partnerships with industry leaders in the commercial processor market as well as through its strong past performance in the heterogeneous HPEC discipline, is uniquely positioned to research and develop integrated code base technology and tools that can generate high-performance, hardware platform-specific code for advanced heterogeneous computing architectures.; BENEFIT: CEI has developed software and hardware technologies for a variety of government programs, and the team has transitioned over 37 products to production for use in DoD and Government systems.CEI also has experience commercializing technology developed under Government-funded programs.Products are packaged as COTS items, listed on a catalog price sheet, supported with technical application notes and marketing materials, and made available for sale to both the commercial and Government markets.CEI will promote technologies developed under this effort as part of its standard commercial product marketing and sales activities.CEI has a robust business development group, sales\/distribution channels, and formal agreements with strategic partners relevant to this project such as Altera, Intel, and NVIDIA.Further evidence of CEIs SBIR commercialization success is demonstrated in its Company Commercialization Report (available online at the DoD SBIR website) and its receipt of the prestigious Tibbetts Award at the White House.This award is presented to small businesses that represent excellence in achieving the mission and goals of the SBIR and STTR program, stimulate technological innovation, and increase commercialization of Federal research.Beyond helping architect heterogeneous HPEC systems and accelerating calculations consistent with the topic focus, general commercialization of this technology is driven by an emerging market for high-performance computing solutions across commercial and defense that mix CPUs, FPGAs, and GPUs that not only increase performance but reduce SWaP footprints.The FPGA market is over $5B and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 9% through 2020.GPU shipments are easily over 50 million units per year.Opportunities for technology to help developers efficiently harness these technologies for efficient HPC are therefore significant.The toolkit technology that would be developed under the proposed program phases will enable heterogeneous computing architectures mixing CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.Prime contractors in the DoD space will also greatly benefit from such technology.Simulation infrastructures are facing computing challenges as requirements and models increase exponentially.There is a need to adapt to new technology paths that will outpace the complexity of the models required to run in the environment.The technology developed here enables an HPC solution for modeling and simulation using a mix of cutting-edge processing technology as well as an open path for future technology inserts.It supports an infrastructure that is capable of technology upgrades based upon GPU and FPGA roadmaps.Prime contractors have stated their interest in CEI&apos;s proposed work on this topic to help address future modeling and simulation challenges.CEI will pursue such relationships as the project matures to position the technology for transition as it moves to Phase II and beyond."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: For miniaturization of low-aberration optics in imagers, sensors and other instruments, Nanohmics, Inc., proposes to develop an ultra-thin, light-weight, high-transmittance, broadband flat lens based on microfabricated metasurfaces.The flat lens metasurface comprises an engineered array of highly efficient resonant sub-wavelength microstructures fabricated with standard materials and CMOS microfabrication techniques, to reduce costs and provide a rapid route to commercialization.Such a flat lens could be an order of magnitude smaller in size and weight, and need less bulky support structures.In Phase I Nanohmics will demonstrate the feasibility of a high-transmittance, broadband flat lens metasurface by designing, microfabricating and testing a proof-of-concept (PoC) flat lens operating in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) band, with TRL 3.Phase I laboratory tests results, and modeling and simulation, will strengthen our design for a visible-band (VIS), high-efficiency, broadband flat lens metasurface to be fabricated in a Phase II program.The Phase II will advance the to a TRL 6 visible-band prototype, which will be laboratory tested and made available to the Air Force sponsor for independent testing.The Phase II prototype will be based on VIS-band dielectric materials, and will achieve higher transmittance and increased immunity to incident polarization.; BENEFIT: Refractive optics provide high-quality imagery but have a number of drawbacks that make them less than ideal for applications involving aircraft or satellites.The substantial size and weight of refractive optics and their supporting structures add to cost and propulsion load.The high-transmittance, broadband flat lens metasurface technology proposed by Nanohmics will enable rapid innovation and commercialization of ultra-thin optical applications with low size, weight and power (SWaP) constraints.Further development will expand the operational bandwidth of the metasurfaces to cover the entire visible, MWIR, or other custom spectral band.These advanced capabilities and features will make metasurface flat lens extremely valuable to a wide variety of applications and customers. Many large and small markets, including the military, industrial, energy, medical, and consumer sectors will benefit from this technology.Ultra-thin metasurface optics, for example, will be very valuable in space vehicles such as observation satellites for situational awareness.Whether airborne or in space, reducing the size and weight of optical systems will accelerate the development and deployment of advanced, compact, affordable, multi-mission payloads.For production of these low-SWaP metasurface optics, Nanohmics will partner with a large contractor, as it has successfully done for many of its recent developments in advanced optical materials and systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The topic requests proposals to develop scalable, flexible lower SWaP-C GPS crosslink capability that allows future operational systems to forego significant dependence upon ground clock and ephemeris refresh with concurrent support of real-time command and control and age of data. The development of this capability will improve the reliability and robustness of future GPS satellites by providing continuous ephemeris updates and terminal control. Future spacecraft will require higher data rate services than those supported today with improved SWAP and other performance criteria.Complicating the environment in which these technologies operate is the shortage of available radio spectrum and the need for interference management.While incremental advances in equipment design and performance in these bands may meet some of these future needs, MaXentric believes that developing equipment to provide high bandwidth communication services in a yet underutilized spectrum, such as the Inter-Satellite 59-71 GHz band, offers a higher potential return on investment and a more significant capability enhancement. In this proposal MaXentric suggests revisiting the utility of these frequencies for space based high data rate communications by developing and demonstrating a high data rate transceiver for the range 59-71 GHz.; BENEFIT: The technology developed in this project results in a cost effective, high performance inter-satellite crosslink. This design can be marketed not only to the DoD, but also to other SATCOM service providers. Below we list applications\/benefits of the system: High bandwidth inter-satellite communications, short-range\/cluster-flight satellite communications, cable replacement &amp; wireless structural health monitoring (SHM), CubeSat science experiments, lunar\/extraterrestrial communications, terrestrial cellular backhaul &amp; Last Mile telecommunications, terrestrial high data rate and covert communications, and other mmWave SATCOM services. Furthermore, the technologies developed during the implementation of this project will be applicable to the creation of many other mmWave based communications links"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The objective of this SBIR effort is to develop a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) augmentation network to provide secure PNT with less than 10 meters horizontal accuracy to ground users in a GPS-denied environment.Prior GPS augmentation concepts have focused on broadcasting GPS-like signals (pseudolites) from ground or airborne transmitters to overcome jamming.Under this effort we propose to develop a pseudolite solution that leverages the proliferation of digital radio networks to provide both tactical communications and PNT, while avoiding jamming altogether through low detection.Under this effort, we shall develop the LPI PNT Augmentation system architecture which will include the pseudolite, control, and user segment.We shall study alternative LPI waveforms that could be used for PNT augmentation and evaluate their timing\/ranging performance, their area of coverage provided for PNT augmentation, and their ability to remain undetected and, therefore, unjammed, in a tactical environment. A high fidelity simulation will be used to demonstrate the expected performance of the LPI PNT system.We shall develop a design for a Phase II prototype based on an operational tactical radio which will be used to demonstrate that the LPI PNT system meets the system objectives.; BENEFIT: Accurate and reliable situational awareness is paramount for successful execution of covert missions. The LPI PNT augmentation network technology is designed to transition into operation as a software application running on fielded tactical radios providing back-up PNT under GPS denied conditions.All U.S. and allied military services are potential customers for our teams product.Our first target market will be Battlefield Airmen, the special operations force of the Air Force, who provide worldwide forward presence, engagement, information operations, precision strike, and rescue operations. We will work with AFRL to identify special operations forces requirements and assure that the Phase II demonstration aligns with a typical CONOPS.We shall also pursue commercialization opportunities with the US Army and Marine Corps who also conduct missions in GPS-challenged environments.NAVSYS LPI PNT system solution also has commercial applications to provide quality indoor location service in critical situations for first responders including police, firefighters and emergency medical personnel."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Echo Ridge proposes to design and performance characterize an LPI\/LPD PNT augmentation system (including beacons and user equipment) using a hybrid frequency hopping, spread spectrum signal-based waveform which we believe can achieve compliant performance in ground applications.We have chosen this waveform class for its unique combination of PNT performance and low probability of intercept.We will build upon an existing Echo Ridge signal-based PNT waveform where we have demonstrated compliant location accuracy.This waveform has been analyzed by outside experts for LPD\/LPI performance.In addition to PNT and LPI performance, a key criteria in our design is operational utility measured in terms of flexibility\/lack of constraints and SWaP-C.For operational flexibility and low cost, it will include battery and prime-powered beacons, and vehicular and dismount user equipment.The LPI PNT augmentation will include the ability to take advantage of partial GPS availability, and transparently and seamlessly maintain PNT performance.Both the beacons and user equipment will be based on SDR technology, allowing PNT and communications functionality to be hosted economically on a common platform.In Phase I and Phase II, existing Echo Ridge SDR platforms will be used for proof of principal demonstrations, and lab and field-based performance characterization.; BENEFIT: This effort will develop Navwar technology for an LPI PNT augmentation system which can provide horizontal location accuracy to less than 10 meters of error to ground users in GPS-denied environments, while simultaneously minimizing detectability by adversaries operating in the environment.The capability will be designed to be SWaP-C compatible with mission and equipment constraints for mounted and dismounted warfighters.The technologies proposed solve routinely identified problems in both the military, other public and commercial marketplaces (unreliable PNT in challenging environment (indoors, urban canyons, jamming)).Rebroadcasting GPS\/GPS-like signal from other platforms\/localities has been the traditional approach.This has been principally driven by the established confidence in GPS waveforms with respect to PNT performance, and the availability of hardware\/software to effectively repeat\/generate GPS\/GPS-like signals.A GPS re-broadcast is easily detectable by all standard techniques, and therefore easily jammed by adversaries.It is therefore not an optimal solution for operational scenarios where adversaries are present.Technologies and operational considerations are changing that create the opportunity for alternatives to GPS\/GPS-like waveforms for pseudolites.These include the proliferation of digital radio networks (including SDR-based) which provide communications facilities between users, and between users and the control segment.They also provide the ability to program new functionality (including sharing the radio resources between multiple functions) into the radio network.These digital radio facilities can therefore be used for traditional communications, passing PNT-related information (such as key distribution, ephemeris\/almanac, etc.), and generating\/receiving PNT ranging waveforms."

During Phase I PSI will assess complementary testbed designs utilizing its patented microwave driven torch (MIDJetTM) technology and the capabilities of the Laser Hardened Materials Evaluation Laboratory (LHMEL) facility. A test facility will be assembled with a 5 kW MIDJetTM torch during the Phase I effort and used to assess heat loading on test samples to demonstrate the feasibility of simulating reentry conditions with 30005000 C air thermal plasmas generated with the torch. Advanced ceramic matrix composite materials will be exposed to the simulated reentry environment and optical diagnostics will be implemented to detect emission from the products of material erosion. A Phase II testbed design(s) utilizing the MIDJetTM and LHMEL facilities will be developed and reviewed with the government. A revised testbed design incorporating government feedback will be implemented in the Phase II program and used to test materials of interest to the Air Force.The acquired test data will be used to validate predictions of CFD-based reentry models and guide signature model development.; BENEFIT: The proposed research and development effort will provided the department of defense (DoD), NASA and DoD prime contractor organizations with a hypersonic materials research testbed that will be utilized to test and validate critical, advanced CFD-based codes utilized to evaluate materials and system designs for orbital or sub-orbital re-entry vehicles. The models that will be supported by the testbed facility resulting from this work are relied upon to assess designs of mission critical materials and components related to a broad range of tactical assets. Finally commercial space enterprises may also benefit from the capabilities of the proposed technology as they rely on reentry models to assess their system designs."

Baseline material properties will be measured and used to support the part design process.SI2 will then validate the process to a TRL\/MRL 3 level by designing, manufacturing and verifying the performance of a demonstration article, such as an embedded x-band array.Work in Phase II will concentrate on refining and optimizing the additive manufacturing materials and processes.Additional baseline material testing will augment the database developed in the Phase I effort and include new materials and more comprehensive material characterization.SI2 will work to identify other parts and part types that could be manufactured via the SI2 developed multi-materials additive manufacturing process.A demonstrator part will be downselected and multiple copies of the part manufactured and characterized to show the accuracy and precision of the manufacturing process.Characterization in the Phase II will include functional and environmental testing.It is anticipated that the Phase II project will result in a TRL 6\/7 for the process and manufactured component. Other DoD high volume applications include low cost x-band SATCOM for Army BFT-3. Commercial applications include low cost x-band antenna and arrays weather monitoring, air traffic control, maritime vessel traffic control, and vehicle speed detection for law enforcement."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A multi-material additive manufacturing (AM) approach that uses space compatible material to produce spacecraft components is proposed here. AM is an alternative to traditional fabrication methodologies that reduces led-time and improve quality for commercial entities that consider this technology for rapid prototyping and manufacture of critical time sensitive components. Metallic parts fabricated using current, conventional Directed Energy Deposition (DED) technologies are known to have high residual stresses, inconsistent density characterized by localized defects and anisotropic microstructure due to complex thermal history and variable cooling rates. There is a lack of methodology for quantifying and certifying mechanical properties due to their anisotropic nature and variability in AM machines\/processes which is delaying the widespread adaption of AM technology for part fabrication\/repair. There are no software packages currently available that are capable of efficiently modeling\/simulating the AM process. For metal AM process this team offers revolutionary integrated physics-based design\/analysis software with Selective Laser Melting manufacturing. For polymer reinforced plastics the team offers a 3D print computational tool that includes material characterization, machine G-code data processing, mesh generation from G-Code, STL file smoothing, assessment of distortion, residual stress, deflection, and damage\/fracture evolution using coupled thermo-mechanical solution.; BENEFIT: The key benefits of this proposed innovation is that it would provide higher level process control for precision manufacturing, controlled results to ensure additive properties meet or exceed wrought properties and a way forward to ensure as-manufactured parts are equivalent to as-designed. A successful application of this innovation would follow two directions. The first would be towards continued development in the laboratory where processes defined in this research would be extended and perfected to address on-going concerns of process control and feedback in additive platforms. The second direction would be to develop software and feedback control to make a product for the immediate real-term needs. This effort will lead to meet the combined needs of government agencies, large corporations, small dynamic corporations, entrepreneurs, hundreds of industries and thousands of potential large scale end-users. From medical devices to aerospace components, application would only be limited by the imagination of the developers."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the DoD need for resilient spacecraft power generation, Roccor has partnered with SolAero to propose the Flexible-Substrate Resilient Array (FSRA).Like Lockheeds venerable Flexible Substrate Solar Array (FSSA) flown on the MILSTAR satellites, the proposed design utilizes a simple structural architecture with a single central beam and a tension-supported blanket.Unlike FSSA, FSRA carries tension through cables which support individual thin solar panels rather than carrying tension through the cell substrate itself.This enables the panels to remain decoupled so that they can be rapidly rotated much like Venetian blind blades for avoidance of man-made threats such as a laser attack.The central beam is a simple telescoping tube which can reliably retract the array into a protective housing to further protect the array against the broadest possible range of threats.While exhibiting a high level of resilience, the efficient FSRA structural architecture combined with folding of the two sub-arrays against the central beam when stowed for launch, also results in competitive performance metrics including a specific power of 200 W\/kg and a stowed volume efficiency of 73 kW\/m.; BENEFIT: The Air Force Space and Missile Commands (SMC&apos;s) mission is to provide resilient and cost-effective Space and Cyberspace capabilities for the Joint Force and the Nation.Various man-made threats are emerging in the space arena, such as directed energy weapons (i.e.: lasers) and kinetic anti-satellite (ASAT) kill vehicles.Being large and relatively fragile, solar arrays are a potential target for hostile action.The proposed FSRA will acheive SMC mission success against emerging man-made threats through high-rate de-pointing for agile threat avoidance and low-rate retraction for more broad threat avoidance.Commercial applications may include avoidance of space debris or meteorite strikes in commercial telecommunication satellite solar arrays."

It is necessary to monitor the structural health of the satellites throughout their life cycles, and it is critical that the monitoring system be robust to the hazards of space deployment. These hazards include extreme temperature, radiation, and charging.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: SHM hardware is needed to meet AFSPC needs for resilient bus technologies.All components attached to space systems are required to be securely fastened in order to provide a good thermal conduction path, and ensure they will not become a hazardous projectile during launch. This requirement is enforced through a limited number of periodic manual spot checks on fasteners, and typically a single mechanical (shock and vibration) and environmental (temperature under vacuum) checkout. This however, leaves a lot of opportunity for the system to change unexpectedly and inadvertently during other periods of the life-cycle. There is also no current capability to do this inspection during or post launch. The MD7-Pro system provides a self-contained, comprehensive guided wave inspection capability. This hardware will be able to be used for an automated, remote, on-demand checks for loosened fasteners and thermal gaps anywhere in a space structure, without disassembly, even in inaccessible locations. During the proposed work, MDC will work to determine an optimal configuration to minimize SWaP for a representative satellite structure, conduct a trade study on risk reducing approaches for surviving space environment and finally produce a small-scale demonstration using embedded algorithms to detect degree of faster loosening.; BENEFIT: Once successfully demonstrated through a Phase II effort, there exists a broad commercial market for this SHM method.One of the key success factors for this technology is its versatility; the ability not only to be integrated into new applications, but to be retrofitted into an existing asset designs. Initial relevant markets would include space applications, but the technology could easily proliferate into any DoD asset, ranging from fixed wing to rotorcraft to ships and ground vehicles, to aid in condition based maintenance. Once demonstrated in defense applications, comparable commercial opportunities exist, particularly for aircraft and potentially buildings and civil infrastructure once the production cost has been driven low enough.MDC will work through strategic partners to license the technology for production and deployment."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The objective of this work is to expand short wave infrared (SWIR) measurement capabilities to ground-viewing radiometers (GVRs) designed, developed, tested, and deployed by the University of Arizona Remote Sensing Group (RSG) to validate the radiometric calibration of sensors onboard Earth-observing satellites. The current version GVR operates at the Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS), a well-understood vicarious calibration facility in use by the RSG for over 10 years. RadCaTS instrumentation includes four multispectral ground-viewing radiometers, a meteorological station, and an AERONET Cimel sun photometer. A satellite uplink allows for near real-time processing. Surface reflectance and atmospheric characterization determined by RadCaTS instruments are used as inputs in MODTRAN radiative transfer code to predict top-of-atmosphere spectral radiance (or reflectance) for the time of overpass. Results validate the radiometric calibration of the sensors under test. RadCaTS currently provides NIST-traceable radiometric calibration data, without the requirement for on-site personnel, to government and commercial satellite organizations such as NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), RapidEye, and DigitalGlobe. The purpose of this work is to validate the lifetime radiometric calibration of geostationary satellite sensors that operate in the 4002500-nm spectral range.This approach is independent of any onboard calibration systems.; BENEFIT: Military, government, and private entities could benefit from the vicarious reflectance-based satellite imager calibration products that could be delivered by VIS\/NIR\/SWIR GVRs as a result of this SBIR.With Phase II resources, an advanced reflectance-based vicarious calibration system could be configured which could have the following attributes: 1) ruggedized, self-contained, and portable for rapid deployment; and 2) provide for remote, unattended operation anywhere satellite links and power constraints allow. As satellite imagers increase in spatial and spectral resolution, and the need for quick response (temporal resolution) is ever greater, the value of advanced vicarious calibration systems is of increasing importance."

Using conventional powder processing techniques ALON components with very complex geometries has been demonstrated. For the program, Surmet will demonstrate absorption of selective wavelengths in either the visible or IR region by addition of dopants to a matrix of ALON Transparent Ceramic. For the purposes of providing ballistic resistance and shielding from high energy microwaves, Surmet will demonstrate a robust doped-ALON material and also demonstrate the adaptability of its advanced technical concepts to form transparent and conformal components.With success in the Phase I program and a follow on Phase II program, Surmet will scale up the process to produce a minimum of two large doped ALON window blanks.The exact dimensions and shape will be mutually agreed upon with the government. Transmission, absorption (at selected wavelengths) and mechanical properties (flexure strength, ballistic response) of the material will be evaluated using well-polished specimens."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Capability and flexibility for interconnection of advanced weapons and other payloads on aircraft combat platforms is significantly limited by the available data throughput paths and associated capacities of the legacy data and signal transfer technologies in current platform\/payload interfaces.Reserved fiber optic provisions in these interfaces offer promise to enhance platform\/payload interconnectivity by orders of magnitude.This would bring payload interconnectivity in line with evolving trends in platform avionics networks, and facilitate a number of useful new operational capabilities that cannot currently be supported.While some preliminary work has been accomplished toward definition of a fiber optic interface capability, applied resources to date have been limited and significant work remains to be done to define and prove feasibility of a practical fiber optic payload interface.The Phase I effort proposed here would establish a requirements baseline for a fiber optics based advanced platform\/payload integration capability and associated networking, investigate candidate implementation technologies and approaches for practical realization of this capability, and define a recommended networking concept for follow-on prototyping and demonstration.A program plan for accomplishment of the recommended prototyping and demonstration under a subsequent Phase II effort would also be documented, along with potential commercialization opportunities.; BENEFIT: The technology developed under this effort will facilitate greatly enhanced integration of payloads with airborne carriage platforms, significantly improving mission effectiveness and operational flexibility of future platform\/payload systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In response to Air Force SBIR topic # AF161-102, Signature Research, Inc. proposes to develop a low-risk technically sound approach to providing a High Fidelity Algorithm to Model the Statistical Variations of Ground Target Signatures. The specific goals of our Phase I proposal include three major efforts. First, we will characterize the multi-spectral signature variability observed in empirical data for a series of T-72 Main Battle Tanks that have been measured with calibrated multi-spectral instrumentation over the past 10 years. Second, we will investigate alternative approaches to implementing target signature variability within the current Model and Simulation framework. Third, we will implement automated algorithms (based on a selected approach) to impose the desired variability using current modeling approaches. Finally, we will demonstrate the utility of the automated algorithm by generating synthetic multi-spectral signatures and comparing the synthetic signature variability to empirical variability.; BENEFIT: At the end of our Phase I effort, SGR develop a Preliminary Software Development Plan and a Signature Variability Model Validation Plan that will lay the foundation for a transition into a Phase II development. By carrying our Phase I program to this level of maturity and demonstration,we believe that the cost-realism of our Phase II implementation and demonstration effort will be very sound. Beyond the prototype, SGRs approach will support commercialization of the system in three key areas:1) Identification of additional DoD simulation applications for the Signature Variability Model (digital, hybrid, and HITL simulations).2) Application of the High Fidelity Signature Variability Model to the War-Gaming industy.3) Application of and adaptation of the High Fidelity Signature Variability Model to energy management of commercial and industrial building using IR modeling."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This SBIR research program aims at addressing the low radar cross-section (RCS) ground target detection and tracking problem under size, weight, and power (SWAP) restrictions. We propose to develop an innovative multi-channel long coherent processing interval (CPI) approach. Its multi-mode operations include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, ground moving target indication (GMTI), and high range resolution (HRR) profile acquisition.It can significantly enhance the low-RCS target detection\/localization\/tracking performance, can detect targets moving slowly in arbitrary directions, and can uniquely determine the target locations, velocities and headings.Moreover, we propose to extend the long-CPI SAR\/GMTI technique to a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar system. The proposed MIMO radar can be used to double the virtual array aperture. Hence, it can significantly enhance the slow moving target detection\/localization\/tracking performance, while retaining the small SWAP advantage.The merits of the proposed solution will be verified by further developing a small and light weight Ka-band hardware radar system, together with real-world data collection and demonstration using the hardware system.; BENEFIT: A successful Phase I effort will result in innovative long-CPI SAR\/GMTI algorithms, and will significantly enhance the detection, localization and tracking performance of low-RCS and\/or low-speed targets, under the SWAP restrictions. It can also advance the state-of-the-art of the moving target detection and imaging technologies. It will be incorporated into a small and light weight Ka-band hardware radar system for data collection and demonstration. Our algorithms and hardware system can also be adapted for civilian applications in areas such as: wide-area search and rescue operations; maritime counter-drug operations; coastal and harbor surveillance; and damage area survey after a natural disaster such as an earthquake. Our small SWAP long-CPI SAR\/GMTI technology will be competitive in both the military or commercial marketplace, due to their improved performance and efficiency."

This will provide the capabilities of radar to new markets that were not achievable with previous radar designs.The low-SNR radar will be a sensor for weapons, manned aircraft, and UAS.Applications include UAS navigation, collision avoidance, weather\/environmental monitoring, law enforcement, etc."

Based on Lunas distributed fiber optic sensing technology, and leveraging recent developments in data acquisition hardware miniaturization, the proposed system will be compact, easily portable, and battery-powered. Virginia Tech, led by Dr. Green, will work with Luna to ensure proper coupling of the optical fiber sensor to the ground being interrogated, optimize the system design, and conduct system testing. The resulting technique and system implementation will provide an attractive alternative to the dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) test, which is mature and widely-implemented but has a prominent acoustic signature, is time-consuming to perform, and requires bulky apparatus. Phase I will focus on system development and demonstrating the feasibility of using this fiber optic sensing approach to assess the load bearing capability of representative ground. Phase II will optimize the system, demonstrate its use on additional ground types, and work with the U.S. Air Force to ensure results are presented in the desired format. During Phase III, Luna will perform final system calibrations and transition the technology to the Air Force."

        "abstract": "McQ proposes to develop a California Bearing Ration (CBR) measurement system to determine the soil bearing strength at remote airfields for safe aircraft operation at these sites. A standard soil strength measurement is CBR. McQ has developed wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) for an AFRL project to communicate sensor data from a buried munitions test unit. The RF propagation through the earth can provide the CBR soil strength data based on propagation parameters associated with the signal traveling through the dirt. McQ will take advantage of the WUSN research performed for AFRL and adapt the electronics to measure CBR using an algorithm developed under this SBIR. McQ will develop under this SBIR the portable, small tool kit that can quickly perform each measurement, record the information on an Android tablet, map the soil strength data over 30 measurement points and collect associated terrain and obstacle imagery to assess the potential airfield usage. McQ has an existing test facility for WUSN measurements to support the development and testing of the proposed system. McQ will use specialized electronics designed for the munitions data retrieval system to develop the CBR algorithm and provide a demonstration at the end of the Phase I effort."

        "abstract": "The challenge of developing effective optical concepts for short wave infrared (SWIR) detectors goes beyond just understanding optical design. The SWIR spectral band provides significant opportunity for implementation of different capability into various platforms.The goal of both day and night operation makes the challenge of compact, dual field of view (DFOV) or multi-field of view (multi-FOV) optics significant.Understanding the con-ops is a key component to developing next generation SWIR and visible\/NIR\/SWIR (VNS) lenses.Low-light level performance requires fast f\/number optics (generally f\/1.4 or faster) making the optics more complex, larger in volume, and often with compromised performance. This challenge is compounded when trying to implement into small, compact, lightweight volumes as are found with small gimbals and weapon sights.This SBIR effort has two primary goals: to develop a dual FOV VNS lens that meets the design goals of the solicitation, and to develop new design solutions that can make significant advancements in lens design for both the SWIR and VNS spectral bands. This will involve both investigating materials and design forms and identifying which will apply well towards fixed focal length lenses and which can be utilized for multi-FOV approaches at an acceptable production cost."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The result of this project will be integration of an advanced high-fidelity hydrocode into the MS Windows-based DoDEndgame Framework infrastructure through use of a flexible, open-source application integration infrastructure developed and supported by Illinois Rocstar. To perform the work, Illinois Rocstar will develop an extension to the MEVA application that allows for general couping to high-fidelity modeling tools through Endgame Framework. In the future, this capability can readily be extended to include other modeling tools currently in use by DoD designers and OEM engineers and can be used to provide multiphysics coupling among these tools. This capability will enable the generation of complex, software-specific input data, and will structure software output data in formats that are intuitive to the weapons planner. This development will minimize the need for expert-level user knowledge to generate results with these high-performance modeling tools. The multiphysics integration infrastructure used to integrate the EPIC hydrocode into Endgame Framework will require minimal, if any modification to the EPIC code, and will provide capabilities for future enhancements to the system. The infrastructure is cross-platform (Linux and Windows) and supports parallel codes on cluster computers for capability expansion when needed.; BENEFIT: The direct benefit from the project will be increased simulation abilities within the DoD suite of simulation tools for use in performing weapons simulations. These improved capabilities will allow for improved performance information to be developed, which ultimately results in improved lethality and perrformance for the warfighter.In terms of Commercial application, Illinois Rocstar uses and supports the open-source Rocstar Simulation Suite (rocstar.org). We are currently in the process of developing &quot;Rocstar Multiphysics&quot; from this already-multiphysics-based code, with a goal of a wide variety of pluggable open and closed-source physics module. Any application that is connected to our multiphysics integration toolkit will ultimately be available within Rocstar Multiphysics, producing a broader application base for the tool, and a wider potential clientele. In addition, from a commercial standpoint, we anticipate, given a successful integration of EPIC into Endgame Framework, we will be able to produce revenue from further government support work, adding further capabilities, and supporting the integration framework for others to add capabilities to Endgame Framework as well."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A 9-month Phase I Small Business Innovative Research feasibility study aimed at implementing the EPIC hydrocode as an Endgame Framework (EF) module that can be used in MEVA (Modular Effectiveness \/ Vulnerability Assessment) and other EF-based applications is proposed.A three-tier development strategy will be employed to support a successful implementation of EPIC into MEVA, with the Phase I effort consisting of tier one and the second and third tiers being completed in Phase II.During tier one, a detailed software implementation plan complete with strategies to model the weapon and target to varying levels of fidelity will be created.Additionally, two-dimensional calculations in EPIC will be performed to demonstrate the communication flow between EPIC and EF.At the end of Phase I, a detailed integration plan for MEVA\/EF, including verification and validation requirements, and a prototype meshing\/discretization tool for both the target and penetrator will be provided to AFRL as Phase I deliverables.; BENEFIT: The EF architecture that this product will utilize will make for a strong commercialization potential in both the DoDs analysis and assessment\/weaponeering tools.Analysis tools like MEVA that use the EF architecture are used in AoA studies, which affect all stages of the acquisition life-cycle.MEVA is therefore seeking increased accuracy to manage program costs.The JMEM Weaponeering Software (JWS), which is currently planned for transition into the EF architecture, is a weaponeering tool that needs results from response modules to be rapid, and sufficiently accurate to be used for military planning.Most of the tools employed in both MEVA and JWS, especially for penetration, use empirical tools like PENCURV that have known limitations. As computer speeds improve, the EPIC module developed under this SBIR project will become a viable alternative to PENCURV, which will increase capability to prosecute various current and emerging targets and countermeasures, with increased accuracy.We envision two stages of commercialization for this tool. The first stage of the transition\/commercialization strategy we envision would be focused on completing a fully capable penetration effects capability for MEVA\/EF: (1) extending the tool for a wider range of targets and weapon, and (2) performing a detailed verification and validation of the tool. This would facilitate accreditation for use in analysis tools like MEVA and even weaponeering tools like JWS. The second stage of the transition\/commercialization strategy would focus on extending the capability to model penetration, blast, fragmentation, and structural response effects, using physics-based codes, all called and handled by MEVA."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In recent years, the defense industry has seen innovative development of smaller, lighter-weight, higher-performance and lower-cost munitions.While this innovation is set to continue into the future with more platforms, the size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of terminal-guidance seekers has not kept pace.Current seeker technology is still very limited by the architecture and method of implementation. Specifically, current state-of-the-art systems require significant total volume and high power consumption at a very high price.FIRST RF proposes a highly innovative approach to reducing the SWaP-C of these seekers by using a non-traditional beamforming approach which eliminates the discrete phase shifters and\/or time delay mechanisms used in modern seekers.By so doing, much of the expensive and complicated beam steering control is eliminated.As a further benefit, this technology provides unprecedented scalability to multiple physical sizes and frequency bands, thereby enabling straightforward adaptation to a wide variety of platforms and beam-steering modes.; BENEFIT: Successful validation of the proposed FIRST RF solution will eventually lead to a lower overall price point for high-performance munitions.Additionally, because of the elimination and\/or minimization of several supporting power and control functions, more volume would be freed up in the highly constrained munition.This may be used for incorporation of additional warhead, fuel, operational functions or lighter weight.Due to the scalability of this technology, it would also have benefit on other SWaP-C constrained platforms, such as UAS.Due specifically to the extremely low-cost potential, it could be extended to all forms of active electronically scanned array (AESA) phased array antennas."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the Air Force need for innovative, cost-effective techniques for antenna electronic beam steering feasible for use in small missile radar seekers, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new electronic Beam Steering Enhanced Antenna Array (BEAST). The BEAST requires only one phase shifter for an N-element antenna and will take advantage of POCs barium strontium titanate (BST) technology. The innovation in BEAST enables reliable, low-SWaP, (size, weight, and power), inexpensive electronic beam steering with limited constraints on the small missile radar seeker. The antenna elements of BEAST are monopole, multiband conformal antennas that are optimally designed for 17 GHz and 34 GHz. Phase I focuses on conceptual design of the innovative cost-effective low-SWAP beam-steering techniques; POC will perform system design, and will evaluate the techniques against factors such as beam forming capability, gain, size, weight, power, cost (SWaP-C) and radiation characteristics such as field of regard (FOR), instantaneous field of view (IFOV), beam width, spectrum, and pattern tuning. In Phase II, POC will develop and demonstrate the technique through a prototype antenna and relevant drive electronics. POC will also prepare a transition plan and evaluate BEAST in a representative platform environment at TRL-5\/-6.; BENEFIT: The BEAST can be used in a broad range of civilian commercial applications, such as automotive collision avoidance radar or adaptive cruise control technology, emerging gigabit wireless personal communication systems for high-bandwidth data transfer of multichannel streaming video, graphic imagery, medical imagery, voice, and sensor data. It can be used in base stations to enhance the signal coverage in a particular area while minimizing interference to other areas. Furthermore, it can be mounted on trains and other vehicles for wideband communication such as WiMax, digital TV, and satellite communications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The overall goal for this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a methodology to develop advanced cumulative-damage models that predict time-dependent deflection, spalling, breach, secondary debris generation, and the incremental damage state for structural components of urban structures subject to multiple weapon detonations.This effort builds on previous work conducted by K&amp;C and ACTA in (1) analytically modeling the behaviors of walls to multiple hits and (2) developing a High Fidelity Physics Based (HFPB) fast-running model (FRM) for modeling cumulative damage resulting from multi-hits scenarios.In this proposal an urban cumulative damage FRM (UCD-FRM), incorporating the complicated physics involved in multiple loadings leading to local and global failure of structural components will be developed.The methodology proposed to develop the UCD-FRM is general in nature and can be readily extended to other structural components or systems and for loadings other than blast and fragmentation.The broad methodology developed under this effort will provide a rational approach for the stochastic consideration of accumulated or cyclic damage and has broad applicability across a range of industries where consideration of accumulated damage and the associated requirements for repair, maintenance and replacement is critical, such as the energy, utility and transportation industries.; BENEFIT: As a science and engineering consulting company actively involved in a multitude of government and private industries including building construction, defense, anti-terrorism, petrochemical plant safety, and nuclear plant and infrastructure safety, K&amp;C is in an excellent position to market, commercialize, and transition the technologies developed under this project. These clients, especially related to their overseas operations, have particular concerns related to the risks engendered by blast and fragmentation loading as well as cumulative damage effects in a fast-running engineering tool, as well as the application of techniques to account for accumulated or cyclic loading in a stochastic manner.The U.S. defense community is another clear market for this technology, which also has interest in the resilience of structures and having the ability to evaluate the effects of cumulative damage. In this regard, the stochastic approach to be taken to modeling cumulative damage will be especially of interest since the probability of a particular outcome in a cumulative damage targeting problem should reflect the uncertainties involved if it is to be useful."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: As the need for engaging targets in difficult environments grows, ultra-wideband and structurally integrated antenna architectures have gained interest.However, these antenna architectures must conform to the limited size and overall outer-mold line of the weapon platforms.Next-generation seekers must perform frequency agile radar and communication waveforms, which will require ultra-wideband apertures. These structurally integrated and conformal antenna arrays may also allow for extended field of regard than traditional nose mounted seekers. Utilizing the surface area typically larger than the missile cross-sectional area, additional antenna gain and thereby longer acquisition ranges can be achieved.Under USAF SBIR topic AF161-110, Ultra-Wideband Structurally Integrated Antenna Architectures, ultra-wideband structurally integrated antennas suitable for the next generation of radar seekers are to be designed. Wang Electro-Opto Corporation (WEO) will leverage its deep and broad knowledge, technology, and experience in this topic to propose a Phase-I research to look at the feasibility and attainable performance of an ultra-wideband structurally integrated architecture for use in a small radar seeker.Identification of technology barriers, trade-off analysis and simulation of critical performance parameters, as well as empirical study with breadboards on critical paths will be performed in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design approach.; BENEFIT: The commercialization of the present technology, Ultra-Wideband Structurally Integrated Antenna Architecture, will be considered a major part of the broad commercialization effort at WEO. In the field of missile seeker antennas, Raytheon is now commanding a predominant market position. Therefore, WEOs commercialization efforts will first focus on Raytheon, as well as other major contractors. It is expected for AFRL to obtain delivery of the prototype for independent assessment. Potential global market for WEOs broadband phased array technology in the private Telecommunications Industry is likely to be more than 10 times larger than that of military applications. WEO has recently launched a high-profile promotional effort with a series of ads in IEEE Microwave Magazine, IEEE Antennas Magazine, and Microwaves and RF Magazine, etc., starting in December 2015."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: SI2 Technologies, Inc. (SI2) will enable next generation RF seeker capability on Air Force (AF) weapons systems with our innovative ultra-wideband, conformal, structurally integrated array aperture. The extremely low profile array will provide an expanded field of regard while maintaining beam shaping capability across a wide instantaneous bandwidthto support evolving software defined radar seekers using frequency agile waveforms. The proposed aperture is based on SI2s proven wideband array architectures and novel antenna miniaturization techniques. Our proposed solution uses the axial length of the platform body for integration, thereby leaving the nosecone area undisturbed and available for other functions.In PH I, SI2 will simulate and optimize aperture performance. We will also simulate the achievable performance on a representative platform, and develop a manufacturing and structural integration plan for the conformal RF seeker aperture technology. SI2 will validate our design and manufacturing approach via fabrication and test of a proof of concept hardware demonstrator to demonstrate TRL 4 at the conclusion of the PH I program. In PH II, we will refine and optimize performance of the ultra-wideband structurally integrated aperture and will also work to integrate it with a next generation RF seeker to develop a full system solution.; BENEFIT: Evolving AF fifth- and sixth-generation weapons platform RF seekers will be software defined and capable of performing multiple missions using frequency agile radar and communication waveforms. These systems will require ultra-wideband apertures; importantly, these apertures must be capable of being structurally integrated and conform to the extremely limited size and outer mold line (OML) of the weapon platform. In addition, an extended field of regard may be required while still maintaining beam shaping capabilities. SI2s proposed innovative ultra-wideband structurally integrated aperture technology is a key enabling technology for next generation RF seekers.Besides the focus on Air Force weapons platform here, there is great demand for small, lightweight, RF seeker systems on other missile platforms, small unmanned air systems (UAS), aircraft and other volume constrained platforms. Additionally, demand for radar seekers for the commercial automotive market is expected to increase in the near future."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The proposed Shape Extraction and Equivalent KEy Recognition (SEEKER) program will perform Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) of small targets (e.g. vehicles) from airborne LIDAR point clouds using a new method of recognition based on topological techniques. Recent years have seen rapid progress in the data collection abilities of airborne surveillance plat- forms. Key challenges remain in recognizing medium and small sized objects, such as vehicles, from both overhead or non-overhead (oblique angle) LIDAR data. SEEKER applies mathematical techniques used for processing n-dimensional data in big data and natural language applications to object recognition. The approach is noise resistant, invariant to rotation, reflection and scaling is- sues, and supports multi-scale classification. By exploiting features in the mathematical structures and real-world physical constraints, the algorithms support operation in a SWaP constrained envi- ronment. The technology transfer plan includes both commercial and U.S. Government customer targets.; BENEFIT: SEEKER is applicable to two broad transition paths, commercial and government. Com- mercial applications include infrastructure, agriculture, and public safety. Government applications include vehicle based ATR as well as terrestrial applications in intelligence analysis and visualiza- tion."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In this project we proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel analysis techniques to produce fingerprints for authentication and reliability monitoring of ICs die before DER, after DER, and while in operation. The proposed technique is based on Power Fingerprinting (PFP) technology, which is an integrity assessment approach based on analog side-channel analysis (e.g. electromagnetic emissions or power consumption) already used to detect counterfeit ICs and hardware Trojans. The ability of PFP to detect counterfeit electronic parts has been demonstrated on a number of platforms and devices. For this Phase I effort we will enhance current PFP implementation to support multiple sensors from multiple domains in order to improve counterfeit detection performance; validate the ability of PFP to detect potential damage to the die suffered during the DER process, while remaining robust to the changes in the side-channels potentially introduced by the new packaging; and evaluate the ability of PFP to leverage predictive modeling techniques to predict end of life for the test platforms.; BENEFIT: The proposed project leverages over eight years of technology development, including side-channel feature extraction, analytical tools to extract baselines, detector and classifier design, and more. The final goal is to transition PFP technology into a complete deployable solution to perform agile, non-destructive inspections of electronic parts in a production environment and test labs across the Department of Defense.This project will provide a proof-of-concept tool to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. More importantly, this project will identify a scalable architecture based on COTS components and the necessary technical requirements for the different configuration to achieve the expected performance metrics providing a solid foundation for Phase II and beyond."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Global Circuit Innovations (GCIs) die extraction and reassembly technology(DER) generated initial interest in and demand by the commercial industry through demonstrating the value of remanufacturing an original integrated circuit (IC) from a plastic component into an environmentally hardened ceramic component, typically for the high-temperature oil and gas drilling service sector.Another unique benefit of this capability is to address military obsolescence IC component issues by locating equivalent donor ICs in undesired packages\/substrates (when possible), extracting the die from the package, and assembling it into the target package or footprint.Thus, although the target device is truly obsolete, there may be sufficient stock of the desired IC in other packages to solve the end customer requirement.GCI proposes an in-depth effort to focus this solution on additional complex analog and digital high performance military ICs (e.g., radar devices) for the specific purpose of evaluation of assembly yields, IC performance stability, and long-term reliability.Additional component testing and\/or increased quality and reliability testing at the very least could qualify additional part types for military use, as well as provide data for continued qualification efforts of the entire process.; BENEFIT: The evaluation of additional components through the DER process will necessarily qualify these specific components and provide a solution for any program requiring these devices. Therefore, the initial component selection should be strategic. Additionally, this study would provide a more thorough examination of the process and final product, particularly as screened to the demanding test specifications of Mil-Std 883.Depending on the ability of this study to attract more funding, any number of products could be sufficiently validated, with the final goal of qualifying the DER process across the board for any\/all extractable IC devices. Ultimately, a significant percentage of current and future electronic obsolescent solutions could be resolved at the component level, rather than at a system level.The net effect of moving in this direction would be the ability to save tens of millions of dollars and decrease the solution lead time from years to months."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In this Phase I, Nokomis will knit together its unique and state of the art Radiated Electromagnetic Emissions (REME) Analysis capabilities enabled by its Hiawatha sensor to generate data that substantiates the ability of DER ICs to be used for DoD applications and will develop a framework for the corresponding Test and Evaluation protocols that would be used to certify DER ICs. Specifically, Nokomis will combine Hiawathas unparalleled sensitivity, demonstrated acuity, and embedded software capability with Nokomis unique understanding of REME Analysis to 1) distinguish between known good and counterfeit, altered, or damaged devices that would be used as starting points for a DER IC, and 2) utilize the evolution of the devices predicted RUL throughout the DER process and post-DER qualification as an diagnostic and predictor of performance stability and long-term reliability (PS\/LTR) for the devices.This will allow Nokomis to demonstrate how to select an IC as a viable candidate for DER, and to, once selected, certify the DER process for that particular IC. The results of this Phase I will demonstrate that with a process that includes REME analysis, DER ICs will become a viable and useful component of existing and future Air Force programs.; BENEFIT: This Research and Development will pave the way for an expanded and generalized DER analysis toolset, along with more nuanced prediction and assessment techniques. These tools and techniques will then be leveraged to assess and qualify a wider range of DER IC candidates that would then be integrated into platforms that to fulfill critical mission requirements in both the military and commercial spaces. As parts specifically designed for extreme conditions become less and less available for legacy systems and a smaller percentage of the commercial electronics market, being the pre-eminent intellectual property holder of DER assessment tools, techniques, and knowledge allows Nokomis to effectively capture significant market share. Further, by developing a comprehensive and well-established process, Nokomis positions itself well as a developer of certification processes. This opens the doors to many commercial opportunities when a need is established that requires the procurement or integration of a DER enabled IC. In addition, the proposed technology uniquely addresses the ability to test, evaluate, and certify DER parts as well as continue to monitor them throughout their lifecycles to allow for condition based maintenance such that initial certification would not be the only commercial revenue steam."

Current systems can search, track and target enemy aircraft and discriminate between multiple aircraft at intermediate to long ranges better than many traditional radar systems fielded today. The unique capabilities of IRST technology is now driving the demand to provide the same capabilities for a variety of different tactical aircraft by improving performance and reducing size, weight, and power (SWaP). A key element to this approach is to move from a steered, small focal lane array (FPA) to a staring, large-format FPA. By eliminating the requirement for bulky mechanical stabilization and pointing hardware, a high-performance, low-SWaP, flexible IRST system can be realized. The challenge to developing such a system is in performing image stabilization in the presence of full aircraft kinematic movement. Toyon in partnership with Lockheed Martin Santa Barbara Focalplane, proposes a solution that uses IMU-based stabilization and innovative infrared search and threat identification algorithms to exploit the rich capabilities of LM-SBFs latest nBn sensors. The proposed system will result in a low-SWaP, wide-field-of-view (WFOV) staring IRST capable of long-range detection and tracking of targets in cluttered environments.; BENEFIT: At the end of the Phase I effort Toyon will have developed an approach for providing non-mechanical image stabilization for a staring WFOV IRST sensor. The Phase II work will lead to the development of a prototype staring IRST sensor based on the design approach established within the Phase I effort. Such a system will result in a high-performance, low-SWaP, WFOV IRST sensor with the flexibility to be installed on a variety of different tactical aircraft. In addition to being deployed in Air Force tactical networks, the main commercial prospect is in the field of commercial surveillance."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Image stabilization is a requirement for high performance imaging, particularly on mobile platforms.Electronic image stabilization systems are lightweight, compact and inexpensive since the stabilization is performed electronically rather than mechanically. Despite advancements in image registration algorithms in recent years, real-time processing in embedded systems remains a significant challenge, particularly for airborne IR applications. As an alternative to this approach, Black Forest Engineering (BFE) proposes to perform frame averaging in a memory array to solve the image stabilization problem. Data from the pixel array is read at a high frame rate and accumulated in the memory array using address offsets to compensate for the shift of the target scene in the pixel array. The result is a frame averaging operation where the location of the accumulated frames in the memory array shifts with each translational vector input to compensate for movement of the scene across the pixel array, producing a stabilized image. These translational vector inputs are calculated from sensor data collected on the aircraft. The required ROIC functionality builds on BFE&apos;s digital pixel architecture and implementation involves straight-forward modifications to existing circuitry currently being designed by BFE for other IRST applications.; BENEFIT: The development of advanced DROIC technologies by Black Forest Engineering will allow increased utilization of large format, fast frame, single and dual-band imaging. The development of low power DROICs will provide high performance in small pixels, enable more low SWAP applications, and increase cryo-cooler life (reduced cryo-cooling power)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Air Force is seeking a compact, wideband aperture for direction finding (DF) with a broad field of view, polarization discrimination, and an operating bandwidth of 2 to 18 GHz.FIRST RF Corporation proposes a breakthrough multi-port antenna design that provides broadband pattern and phase center stability that is comparable to a spiral antenna, but from a greatly reduced form-factor that provides an improved field of view, better efficiency, and provides unprecedented polarization discrimination capability from a single aperture. Moreover, the antenna is tailored to interface with next-generation multi-channel receivers by eliminating the need for beamforming hardware that has previously burdened both the size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) and the efficiency of the legacy systems. The wide field of view spans at least 120 in both azimuth and elevation and the pattern stability allows a reduced look-up table for simplified calibration and improved platform independence. FIRST RF has also introduced two innovative broadband frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs) to incorporate into the design to further optimize the antenna patterns.; BENEFIT: In the last several years, the concepts of operation (CONOPS) for virtually all airborne battlefield operations have grown to intimately rely on the electromagnetic spectrum availability. As a result, there is an unprecedented urgency to ensure that our militarys Electronic Sense (ES) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities provided in part by direction finding systems can reliably and efficiently provide the awareness needed to protect the spectrum. As recent technological developments continue to systematically drive down the size and cost of the electronics supporting direction-finding sensors, there is a growing demand for lightweight and conformal antenna systems to enable these breakthroughs to be applied to a broader range of airborne platforms, including 5th generation fighters through small UAVs. Unlike electronics, however, antennas do not follow the principals of Moores Law, as their size and bandwidth are governed by fundamental physical limitations.Given the unique discriminators of FIRST RFs approach, including the improved efficiency, wide bandwidth, large field of view, and compact form-factor, these technologies are anticipated to play a critical role in advancing the capability of modern direction finding systemsincluding not only those systems used for military applications, but also in an emerging number of commercial applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: SI2 Technologies, Inc. (SI2) will enable next-generation direction-finding capability on Air Force (AF) platforms with our innovative ultra-wideband, conformal, dual-polarized antenna aperture. The extremely-low-profile antenna will provide an expanded field of view while maintaining angle-of-arrival accuracy across a wide instantaneous bandwidth to support evolving software-defined direction-finding systems. The proposed aperture is based on SI2s proven wideband antenna architectures and novel antenna miniaturization techniques. Our proposed solution uses a single, conformal aperture to meet the platform requirements.In PH I, SI2 will simulate and optimize aperture performance. We will also simulate the achievable performance in a direction-finding system, and develop a manufacturing plan for the conformal direction-finding aperture technology. SI2 will validate our design and manufacturing approach via fabrication and test of a proof of concept hardware demonstrator to demonstrate TRL 4 at the conclusion of the PH I program. In PH II, we will refine and optimize performance of the ultra-wideband dual-polarized aperture and will also work to integrate it with next-generation direction-finding electronics to develop a full system solution.; BENEFIT: Evolving electronic threats faced by the AF require direction-finding platforms that are able to detect over a broad frequency range and with polarization diversity. Key to achieving this performance is the development of antenna technology that provides ultra-wideband, dual-polarization performance over a wide field of view, in a form factor that is appropriate for airborne applications. SI2s proposed innovative ultra-wideband structurally integrated aperture technology is a key enabling technology for addressing the next generation of RF threats.In addition to integration onto AF airborne platforms, there are many other military applications for a compact, low-profile, ultra-wideband direction-finding system. As an example, US Navy submarine direction-finding ability is currently limited due to lack of space for upgraded platforms that would require larger antennas. Military operations requiring covert or low-observable operation (such as SOCOM) could also benefit from enhanced direction-finding ability in a small package."

The antenna developed on this program will support missions in the 2-18 GHz frequency range, and the general components demonstrated in the PolyStrata technology can be extended to millimeter wave frequencies.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: QuinStar Technology proposes to develop a low noise amplifier (LNA) for SATCOM downlinks operating at 71-76 GHz with an optimized noise figure (NF), enhanced linearity, and reduced power consumption. We will accomplish this by utilizing a combination of state-of-the-art device technology and innovative circuit techniques. First, we plan to utilize advanced sub-100nm gate InP HEMT or mHEMT device technology to realize a MMIC noise figure of 1.5 dB at 76 GHz. This 1.5 dB noise figure is necessary to account for packaging losses and temperature effects. While we have been working with leading semiconductor foundries, during Phase I we will evaluate their status and select one as our Phase II partner. Secondly, we are proposing to utilize a cascode circuit configuration to improve the amplifier linearity, and bias the amplifier stages in series (current reuse) to reduce power consumption. Neither one of these techniques has been attempted before at these frequencies. Simulations described in this proposal indicate that with these innovative techniques, we can simultaneously improve the amplifier linearity while reducing the power consumption. In fact, simulations indicate that we can reduce IM products by 20 dB or more with a total power consumption of only 25 mW.; BENEFIT: Anticipated Benefits:The primary application for this technology is the E-band military communications system currently under development by the Air Force. This system is required to handle the large amounts of airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (AISR) data, command and control information at high data rates, and a large number of communication channels in support of many aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are envisioned in the future. Specifically, the low noise amplifier technology described in this proposal is in support of ground-based SATCOM receivers operating at 71-76 GHz for this communications system.Commercial Applications:In addition to ground-based SATCOM applications, this low-noise technology can be applied to space-based applications, including broadband RF cross-link communications in constellations, as well as airborne, including very high altitude long duration reconnaissance UAV, and terrestrial applications. Specific examples include the Joint Arial Layered Network (JALN), the ICD effort from STRATCOM and AISR. Further, this low noise MMIC technology can be readily applied to other military missions at adjacent frequencies, such as W-band (75-110 GHz). QuinStar is currently producing the mmW front-end for the AARGM missile, and the low noise technology developed on this program is directly applicable to the AARGM program. Other applications include V\/E\/W-band low noise front ends for aircraft\/helicopter radar landing systems, NASA Earth science applications, UAVs, and various military communication systems. Current technologies (primarily GaAs based) cannot produce the low noise performance and\/or the linearity that these systems require."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Low Noise Amplifiers covering the 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz bands with ultra-low noise figures of less than 1.5 and 1.7 dB at the MMIC level, and 1.8 and 2.0 dB at the modules waveguide flange level, respectively, are proposed. This represents a reduction of nominally over 1.0 dB over one newly announced MMIC, and over 3 dB reduction relative to all other commercial LNAs. V-band ground terminals are the near-term application. In addition there is a continuing need for front-end components to exploit the available 5 GHz bandwidth for both space and terrestrial government and commercial communications links. The LNAs will be compact, have minimal power consumption, and be producible. They will be operable over the -40 to +80 Deg. C range, and can be expected to have very low noise temperatures when operated at cryogenic temperatures. The proposed technologies, 50 nm InGaAs MHEMTs grown on GaAs or 35-50 nm InP HEMTs, will have a path to space-qualification i.e. high reliability and radiation-hardened (81-86 GHz uplink). Additional circuitry such as on-MMIC limiters, linearizers, and attenuators will be simulated as improvements in survivability, dynamic range and gain-control. The noise figure, gain, power consumption and dynamic range, and other characteristics will; BENEFIT: The near-term, driving, application of the ultra-low-noise amplifiers is V-band ground terminals. In general, government and military applications include satellite downlink and uplink reception of spectrally efficient waveforms, satellite-to-satellite links, full-waveguide bandwidth weather and ice-coverage observation, radio astronomy (low-power consumption cooled and cryogenic LNAs), battlefield communications, and secure communications. Dual-use applications include easily-licensed small-antenna full-duplex links with 5 GHz bandwidth, licensed on a link basis rather than a broadcast basis. The technology is transferrable to communications applications in general."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Air Force seeks a trade study into a GPS M-Code Acquisition engine that utilizes the M-Prime version of the M-Code signal to provide the ability to operate more effectively in contested environments where high levels of jamming of the GPS system are to be expected. RRC will leverage the considerable advances in silicon technology and improved insights into computational algorithms that have occurred since the inception of the GPS modernization program to design a highly jam-resistant GPS M-Code acquisition solution with rapid TTFF. RRC plans for direct acquisition of the M-Code signal without reliance on C\/A-code or other less resilient waveforms. The proposed approach uses a frequency-domain algorithm with a cross ambiguity function (CAF) processor to efficiently implement high processing gain with a large search space in delay (ITU) and Doppler (IFU). RRCs proposed architecture achieves a very high level of dynamic range and both coherent and non-coherent processing gain to meet the performance specifications.; BENEFIT: In this study, we identify a full GPS receiver implementation and SDR-based architecture that provides low cost and flexibility to support custom and unique GPS receiver applications with benefits to a variety of customers in the Federal marketplace. The study bolsters RRCs ongoing commitment and investment in GPS technology, including current efforts to develop a software-defined GPS receiver using an embedded ARM processor on a Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC). A portion of our effort in Phase II and Phase III is the development of an acquisition engine architecture that readily integrates with an SoC type architecture for the software-defined receiver. An important output of the study determines whether the acquisition engine is a standalone ASIC that operates as a co-processor or as an accelerator as part of a multi-chip solution, or if the acquisition engine is integrated as part of the SoC itself. This study represents an opportunity for RRC to commercialize a complete GPS receiver solution based on the critical technological advances developed under this SBIR."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Tanner EFI chip assembly, mass fabricated in batches of 1800 devices on a 4-in PC-board substrate, was tested at LANL with recorded slapper velocity exceeding 4000 meters\/sec. The high-fill factor is coupled with a PC-board process that allows protruding header pins to be soldered into plated blind vias eliminating wire bonds completely. This contact architecture provides a robust electromechanical connection able to withstand high G-force exposure. The EFI chip is manufactured using a MEMS process that is intimately coupled with industry standard PCB manufacturing.This MEMS process enables a lithographically defined barrel which can survive high G environments due to its 100 micro-gram mass.The Tanner EFI chip assembly is fully customizable during fabrication allowing for the adjustment of important design parameters to vary output performance, including: slapper density\/speed, height of barrel stand-off, and foil consistency\/resistance. In the proposed Phase I, Tanner will develop and demonstrate structural simulations designed to portray the improved shock survivability of this highly integrated monolithic EFI chip design, and to fabricate and test preliminary high-G robust EFI device.; BENEFIT: Improvements in the fundamental EFI chip assembly mechanism can be reliably optimized in a highly stressing G-force environment. High-G characterization of the PCB manufacturing process will enable better understand of high-G shock survivability and failure modes of accompanying EFI fireset PCB substrates, and ancillary electronics.The FR4 PC-board substrate, being less dense than typical EFI substrates, provides a mass with significantly lower susceptibility to shear-stress concentration. With the two header pins partially embedded into the EFI chip assembly, the mechanically strength of the Tanner design is much greater. Most importantly, our design avoids any wire-bonding that is fragile and unable to reliably transport fast-rise time high current to efficiently activate an exploding foil."

The monolithic design also reduces the susceptibility of the EFI to high shock loads.While the monolithic EFI shows promise, the design requires refinement to enhance manufacturability and optimize reliability in high shock environments.In this proposal, a hybrid DHD EFI is presented which incorporates a variety of potential bridge materials deposited using an inexpensive, reliable, low temperature deposition method capable of depositing inorganic and organic materials including metals, ceramics, and polymers. The use of reactive bridge materials deposited via GDCS could further enhance the reliability of EFIs by increasing the flyer velocity and increasing the amount of solid phase reaction products.; BENEFIT: Increased flyer velocity, improved manufacturability, improved reliability"

The system will utilize techniques to keep it self-powered for up to 20 years. The Phase I effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of this goal.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Air Force needs an external, self-powered, non-invasive, RFID-like status monitoring device to track the handling and environmental factors experienced by missile armaments during its lifetime. Few current missile armament monitoring systems have the capability to monitor environmental conditions and use that data to determine time spent in storage, on the flightline, on the aircraft, or in the air. The developed system would need to be extremely low power to ensure extended lifetimes with limited power sources, include on-system intelligence for distinguishing between different armament statuses, and utilize small, wireless, low-profile, reliable, inexpensive sensing technologies that enable ease of integration into existing storage weapons systems. Lunas proposed solution will consist of a sensor system that will provide on-device analysis of the G-loads, Temperature, Humidity, and Light Intensity for the duration of asset storage, handling, and deployment. The embedded intelligence will use the aforementioned data set to correctly quantify armament status state and amount of time spent within each state.; BENEFIT: The proposed sensing system will be beneficial to all military applications concerned with armament storage monitoring. Armament status monitoring sensor will be applicable to any wooden round, not just missiles, for monitoring storage and handling practices and degradation due to external or environmental forces during the entire life cycle of an armament. The armament status monitoring sensor will decrease time spent on monitoring, evaluating, and logging missile armament inventory. End user can make predictive assessments on health of armament so preventative measures can be taken before missile armament gets damaged beyond repair. Revenue will come from any party interested in monitoring their storage and handling methods and the effects it causes upon their products. The armament status sensor will be marketable towards all military branches and prime integrators of missile armaments such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. The sensing system could also be applied to more commercial markets that are concerned with current storage and handling procedures such as the medical field with sensitive pharmaceuticals or biotechnological products."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Maintenance and sustainment are critical to structural integrity and availability of US Air Force aircraft.The first line of defense against corrosion is coatings and protection systems that provide barriers to the environment and inhibit corrosion of structural alloys.There are currently no methods or monitoring techniques to assess protection system condition, corrosive ingress into airframe structures, and nucleation of corrosion damage, other than the visual observations of corrosion.Advances in electrochemical and impedance based measurements, passive flexible electronics, and embedded sensor networks provide the means to address the critical need for direct measurements of protection system condition and corrosion of complex multilayer aircraft components.Impedance based measurements provide the capability to quantify barrier properties, coating cracking, and other coating mechanical damage that would allow environmental ingress into the airframe.Electrochemical measurements provide a means for assessing moisture, amount of inhibitor, and active corrosion.To support Air Force objectives, Luna proposes the development of a passive powered, embedded, micro-electrode sensor array that can be interrogated using a walk up, handheld reader that provides immediate read out of coating condition including barrier properties, amount of remaining inhibitor, and subsurface contaminants, and corrosion.; BENEFIT: A successful product development effort will result in a robust, accurate, and reliable on-aircraft coating and corrosion measurement system.The ability to measure and monitor coating condition including barrier properties, remaining inhibitor, contaminants within the structure, and corrosion throughout the aircraft lifecycle will allow for enhanced maintenance and sustainment practices to optimize total ownership costs and aircraft availability. Though designed specifically for integration with Air Force aircraft, the system will be applicable for use in other military assets as well as commercial applications in aerospace, oil and gas, chemical process, and transportation industries.The system will be valuable to government and industry organizations that maintain and sustain infrastructure and assets that are exposed to harsh environments.The direct measurement systems will enable more efficient maintenance practices to achieve the optimal balance of costs and availability while contributing to structural integrity."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: TRI\/Austin will develop and validate a sensor for detecting the initial stages of coating breakdown testing based on TRIs patented Embedded Environment and Loads (EEL) sensor (U.S. Patent No. 7913570). This sensor design is well suited for implementation in miniature using thin film sensors as well as integration into a larger test coupon. The EEL provides a number of key capabilities to support the sensing requirements: It provides real time, continuous measurement of corrosion activity, not corrosivity. It supports additional environmental sensors (temperature, humidity), and supports bare or coated structure. The sensor electronics are separable and reusable for cost effectiveness.; BENEFIT: There are a number of families of sensors that have been proposed as corrosion sensors, but actually measure environmental parameters like humidity. Many of these are 20 years old or more. TRI\/Austins EEL sensor actually measures the electrochemical activity of corrosion, not a parameter that implies corrosion. The EEL sensor package can also be implemented in a thin film, allowing insertion into restricted access environments or into layered structures. The EEL sensor could be integrated into a package and used for local monitoring of structures from aircraft to bridges to storage tanks; its inherent simplicity and low cost make it a promising candidate for use in a variety of applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Vibrant proposes the application of Process Compensated Resonance Testing (PCRT) as an alternative wheel and bolt inspection. PCRT uses the collection and analysis of a parts resonance frequencies to perform PASS\/FAIL NDI, process monitoring and control, and part life monitoring for a wide range of critical aerospace components including wheels and bolts. In commercial wheel and bolt inspections PCRT has demonstrated sensitivity to defects and material conditions of interest, including those that cannot be detected by MT and PT. PCRT systems automatically collect resonance frequencies and analyze them with statistical scoring methods, returning a PASS\/FAIL result that requires no operator interpretation. PCRT does not require extensive cleaning of components or strip and recoat of wheels. PCRT generates no hazardous waste and uses relatively simple equipment. PCRT inspections are very fast, typically requiring less than 30 seconds for a PASS\/FAIL inspection. In this Phase I project, Vibrant will acquire wheel and bolt sample parts, collect resonance data from them, and develop PCRT inspections that detect the conditions of interest. Vibrant will perform feasibility demonstrations of the sorting capability. The work performed in this project will lead to the creation of a robust prototype system for high throughput testing in Phase II.; BENEFIT: Successful application of PCRT inspections to in-service wheels and bolts will yield significant benefits to DoD and commercial customers. PCRT will improve safety of flight through accurate detection of defects and material conditions that cannot be found by legacy MT and PT methods. PCRT inspections are fast and automated, dramatically reducing inspection time and cost. PCRT reduces human error by producing an automated PASS\/FAIL result that requires no interpretation. PCRT tests do not require stripping and recoating of wheels, further cutting inspection costs and removing another source of inaccuracy in PT testing. The elimination of wheel strip\/recoat, coupled with no generation of hazardous waste, gives PCRT a much smaller environmental and regulatory footprint than legacy methods."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Achieving desired bondline temperatures is critical to ensuring proper wetting, flow and cure when repairing composite structures.A novel method for measuring\/managing cure temperature in the bondline is proposed, using patented amorphous microwire temperature sensors placed permanently within the bondline and read remotely via low-frequency electromagnetic interrogation. The interrogated microwire sensors provide a sharp, distinguishable voltage pulse to a remote antenna whose integrated area is directly proportional to sensor temperature.More than one microwire per sensor provides self-calibration and signal normalization. Preliminary development of the microwire sensors and reader system prove its ability to remotely measure the temperature of a sensor permanently embedded within more than one inch of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer.Furthermore, testing has shown that the sensor does not present a critical flaw in the composite structure.For this USAF Phase I project we propose to show the feasibility of integrating our novel microwire temperature-measurement system into a hot bonder system to provide closed-loop feedback temperature control based upon temperatures within the bondline. The microwire-enhanced bonder system\/repair process will not only benefit USAF applications but will improve broader aircraft industry and automotive repair processes while also enhancing commercial infrastructure repair processes within the civil engineering field.; BENEFIT: A critical element for controlling the production rate, quality, and cost of composite structures is the management of temperature within the structure during the curing cycle.Unfortunately, no current temperature sensor system can be embedded within aerospace CFRP parts or on the bond line of CFRP repairs to measure this critical temperature and remain in the part post-cure without causing a structural flaw.Our patent-pending microwire temperature sensing (MTS) technology can do this.Furthermore, innovative composite curing processes that require instantaneous temperature information to allow high power transfer rates to the resin without overcooking it (say, for instance, microwave heating, induction heating, or ultrasonic heating) may become feasible for production processes with real-time feedback from embedded MTS sensors.This new technology will be of significant and direct benefit to key USAF and other military applications.The high curing rates that these innovative processes allow will bring down the cost of composite manufacturing so that other industries such as the automotive industry can take advantage of composite materials high strength\/weight ratio to make more fuel-efficient vehicles. Furthermore, the improvements to composite repair processes enabled by MTS technology will make infrastructure repairs such as bridge repairs safer and more cost-effective.Finally, MTS technology holds promise for improving the vehicle tire curing process and for a host of potential applications not yet discovered."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: METSS will design and fabricate a battery-free wireless sensor to monitor the temperature of the bondline region during the vacuum curing of a composite material on the damaged region of an aircraft.The sensor will be designed for placement directly into the region to monitor and transmit a signal to a reader outside of the vacuum bag.The sensor, smaller than the pre-determined critical flaw size, will include a thin film epoxy substrate, chemically etched copper antenna, and semiconductor based temperature sensing material.METSS will formulate a novel substrate material that directly incorporates itself into the composite matrix, reducing any loss of mechanical properties.The copper antenna, an electric-inductive-capacitive resonator, will interact with the electromagnetic waves broadcast from the reader and generate a corresponding temperature based signal due to the electrical response of the metal oxide sensing material.METSS will measure the sensor response with techniques similar to those found in the commercial sector of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags.; BENEFIT: METSSs work with the sensor development will parallel collaboration in the commercial sector to adapt the current hot bonders used in the field for the vacuum bagging technology.The target is to develop a sensor platform that can be directly incorporated into the current temperature control system, minimizing the time from lab-bench to the flight line.Further development of the technology will result from the design and manufacture of a low cost handheld reader for the sensor.METSS will utilize commercial partnerships to transition the sensor platform into industry displacing a segment of wireless temperature monitoring."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The current Phase I program is focused on the development of an affordable test method to extract local crack growth data for cracks propagating through Microtexture Regions (MTRs) occurring within a titanium material, and to assess the viability of the method for crack growth characterization.Per the solicitation, emphasis will be given to near-threshold cold dwell crack growth conditions where the crack tip constraint may be considered to be plane strain.Under these conditions, the crack growth acceleration due to the presence of MTRs is believed to be maximized.; BENEFIT: In Titanium, crack growth rates in MTRs are estimated to be 10x-100x that of the bulk material.This phenomenon has contributed to a number of turbine engine incidents over the past 40 years yet a great deal of uncertainty remains. Thus, a more detailed assessment of the impact of material texture and microtexture on material performance is required.In a broader context, it is anticipated that the methods developed herein could potentially find future use in quantifying local crack growth properties not only in MTRs, but other constituent particles of interest in multi-scale material model development."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: SA Photonics will leverage its experience using high-frequency surface currents to interrogate the physical parameters of very small fatigue cracks growing on titanium alloys as they propagate through regions of varying microtexture. In some regions, clusters of grains with similar crystallographic orientation persist over millimeter length scales, and affect fatigue crack growth in complex ways. During Phase I, we will evaluate a technique based on these principles: (1) high-frequency stimulation to achieve much smaller skin depth than the micro-crack dimensions, (2) highly repeatable current injection points and parasitic electromagnetic loads, (3) multi-position interrogator instrumentation that is retracted from the test piece during fatigue cycling and (4) mixed analytic\/numerical crack shape determination from interrogator data. Thus, the measurements we will carry out in Phase II will allow us to use standard fatigue cycling methods and cost-effectively track the crack tip propagation near and below the surface without intervention. The reduced cost of gathering data will enable much more complete characterization of fracture dynamics in materials with varying microtexture.; BENEFIT: The proposed instrumentation and technology will enable detection of cracks and measurement of crack shape parameters during fatigue cycling. This will substantially reduce the cost of acquiring extensive data on crack propagation and fracture mechanics, which will be critical to determining the performance limits of specialized materials used in very high-stress, high-temperature applications such as jet engines. The great expansion of data will give engineers the confidence to produce new designs that push closer to the materials&apos; physical limits and achieve heretofore unrealized performance."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Metallic high pressure compressor (HPC) blades are a critical component in all jet engines and can incur erosional and impact damage during normal operations. During an engine maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) cycle, these blades are routinely removed from the engine, cleaned, inspected, and either repaired or replaced based on the type of damage and the repair capability available. A common repair technique is the use of high speed grinding to carefully blend out surface damage such as gouges, nicks, scratches, etc. primarily located on the leading and trailing edges of the blade. This is a time consuming and labor intensive process and is highly reliant on the skill level of the individual maintainer. There is a need for an improved process that can more quickly, reliably, accurately, and repeatably inspect and repair these blades. Cybernet specializes in improving such processes through the targeted application of automation. In the proposed effort, we will design and develop an automated workcell that can identify and categorize surface defects on HPC blades and then perform high speed grinding\/blend repairs on these blades based on defect size and location.; BENEFIT: The proposed technology will create an automated system for inspecting and repair surface defects on high pressure compressor blades. This technology will support maintenance, repair, and overhaul of turbine engines for both military and commercial entities. It will lead to a significant increase in the quality and repeatability of the repair process while increasing the speed at which repairs can be conducted."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Integrally bladed disks (IBDs) are highly desirable from a performance perspective and as such are now used in the fan and compressor sections of state-of-the-art military turbine engines. IBDs are unique in their design as the airfoil and the disk to which they are attached is of one piece construction. Unfortunately, they are also large, complex, extremely expensive, long lead items, which are subject to foreign object damage (FoD), making IBDs difficult to maintain affordably. Efficient sustainment of engines employing IBDs requires that damaged airfoils can be repaired.This proposed SBIR project will demonstrate IBD blade repair methods that have the capability to achieve 90 percent or greater of the parent metal properties and will be affordable for implementation at the military engine repair and overhaul depots.; BENEFIT: Successful completion of this proposed SBIR will position the repair technology for application to the repair of integrally bladed disk airfoils at military depots as well as for large repair houses having the capability to repair such components.The technology will also be useful to the engine OEMs for in-process repair of IBDs during their original manufacture."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Integrally bladed disks (IBDs) are critical components of jet engines that must be replaced at great cost if they experience any damage. The Air Force has begun a push to repair IBDs, rather than replace them, and requires a non-destructive inspection method to confirm there are no structural defects associated with the repair and that the microstructure of the repair has been properly blended with that of the bulk.To address this issue, TRI\/Austin will leverage previous research and using a combination of highly focused, non-contacting polyvinylidene floride (PVDF) ultrasonic (UT) transducers and high gain amplifiers to perform ultrasonic backscattering measurements to identify signals corresponding to the grain structure in Ti6Al4V. This will be combined with more traditional UT inspections to identify internal and external structural flaws in the repair.TRI\/Austin will team with the University of Texas at Austin for metallurgical expertise and fabrication of Ti6Al4V specimens to demonstrate this technology in Phase I.; BENEFIT: Ultrasonic systems, such as the one proposed in this work, are non-contacting, safe, and are a widely adopted means to perform non-destructive inspections in many industries. The ability to be able to inspect and quantify the surface microstructure (size, shape, micro-texturing, etc.) is invaluable to the end user of a component. In the case of the Air Force, the proposed technology will assist in ensuring better part quality, tighter controls on inspection of repairs, better life predictions for repairs, and better supplier and manufacturing controls, such as fewer unnecessary purchases of replacement integrally bladed disks.Additionally, quantified C-scan images and datasets for any repair will fit neatly into the Air Forces Digital Twin initiatives to digitize inspection records, CAD files, repairs, etc., associated with each individual airframe. Other potential adopters of the final product from this proposal would include any military branch operating turbine powered aircraft engines that is in the process or has made the change from individually installed blades to integrally bladed disks, such as those used on U.S. Army rotary winged aircraft.Development of an ultrasonic based inspection system, such as is required for this SBIR effort, will translate very well to the titanium welding industry, both in terms of microstructural examination, and inspection of structural defects within welds.Civilian uses for titanium welding, and therefore, potential commercial customers for an NDI system such as this range from aerospace, marine, chemical plants, process plants, power generation, oil and gas extraction, medical technology, and sports equipment."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This Phase I SBIR program seeks to develop a new EBC system with high temperature bond coat increasing engine operation temperature as well as alleviating surface recession of SiCf-SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMC). Oxidation and water resistance of the new bond coat alloy, along with a thermal shock resistance, will be explored. EBCs have been applied to the SiCf-SiC CMCs hot sections of aircraft turbine engines to mitigate an active oxidation, and increase fuel efficiency and to extend the life of CMC components; however, there remain the issues related to upper temperature limit and the material recession in the presence of high temperature water vapor. These issues are closely linked to low thermal stability of the bond coat in SOA EBC systems and the active oxidation.Due to this fact, current efforts are focused on developing new bond coat alloys with use temperature up to 2700oF or higher. We propose the development of new, high temperature (&gt;2700oF) bond coat compatible with SOA EBC systems to achieve a high fuel efficiency and a longer lifetime.; BENEFIT: EBCs are used for the SiCf-SiC CMCs hot sections of the aircraft engines but limited by unpredictable lifetimes and poor reliability. A new bond coat compatible with SOA EBC systems could significantly increase use temperatures and fuel efficiency, and reduce surface recession. Full incorporation of advanced EBC with a new bond coat alloy into the military aircraft and commercial turbine engines will be expected."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Incipient thermal damage (ITD) of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites cannot be detected by common nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods, such as ultrasound or visual inspection.ITD, however, can reduce matrix dominated mechanical properties of composites and thus requires detection and evaluation to ensure the integrity of composite structures that may be subjected to thermal exposures.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is an established technique that has shown promise for NDE of ITD.The purpose of this work is to develop methodologies using FTIR to detect thermal damage of BMI carbon fiber reinforced composite with ITD.: The FTIR works by measuring chemical changes to the polymer matrix as a function of the time and temperature of exposure, which can be correlated with matrix dominated mechanical properties such as short-beam strength (SBS). A model that uses FTIR spectra to predict the level of damage based on the FTIR measurements will be developed. Additionally, a complementary technique of using Fringing Electric Field Dielectrometry sensors will be integrated with FTIR scans in order to achieve an unprecedented diagnostics capabilitybeing able to combine sensor signals from the surface and from the bulk of the material for a comprehensive damage evaluation.; BENEFIT: The proposed project will advance progress towards a powerful and versatile non-destructive sensing technology widely applicable to aircraft technology as well as naval and automotive fields, as composite materials are used increasingly commonly in these fields.This approach offers several advantages over current NDE, including more sensitive detection of incipient thermal damage. Successful development of the proposed methodology maylead to the determination of depth of damage, as well as surface damage."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: There is an urgent need for a light weight and low power technology that can provide anti-icing and de-icing capability for the MQ-9 reaper. The Lynntech team proposes to use a proprietary technology based on Pulsed Plasma Jet actuators (PPJ) to generate high impulse and elevated temperature jets that disrupt ice formation on the MQ-9 wings, tail and engine intakes. Lynntechs Pulsed Plasma Jet (PPJ) actuators are lightweight, simple to build and install onto the MQ-9, and do not require access to the bleed air from the MQ-9 engine. Lynntech will prove the efficacy of the PPJ system for anti icing through a combination of experimental testing and computational simulations. The Pulsed Plasma Jet (PPJ) technology has been thoroughly investigated by Lynntech in the past for several aerodynamic applications including stall delay and skin friction reduction. The proposed anti icing technology when applied in the appropriate configuration could have the added benefit of reducing aircraft drag and thereby increase the MQ-9 flight range.; BENEFIT: The light weight and low power PPJ technology can provide effective protection for various UAV and aircraft platforms under a variety of ice forming flight conditions. In addition to being a effective anti-icing technology, the PPJ actuators have been demonstrated to assist in delaying aircraft stall as well as reduce aircraft drag.Therefore the PPJ technology can have a multi faceted benefit on aircraft safety (both anti-icing and stall delay) and can significantly reduce fuel consumption or increase payload.Either will make aircraft operation more safe and profitable. Reducing fuel consumption will also reduce emissions, including aircraft-produced CO2."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter uses metal nutplates to secure fasteners in areas that have no backside access at the time of installation.These nutplates are attached with a two-part adhesive which currently requires a 24 hour cure at room temperature.This long cure time negatively impacts the aircrafts availability if an aircraft comes back to the depot and they have a disbond of a nutplate that requires repairs.The Air Force desires quick repairs to get the aircraft back in the air and in missions within 5 hours.To achieve this goal new methods are needed for an accelerated adhesive cure for nutplate repairs.Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc (TRI\/Austin) will establish technical feasibility by demonstrating the accelerated adhesive cure system for nutplates on the F-35 will meet the operational and environmental requirements.The technical hurdles will be addressed with laboratory environment testing and performance characterization through experimentation.The accelerated cured nutplates will be tested to critical shear strength, peel strength and impact strength and compared to the 24 hour cured adhesive.The accelerated curing system will also be required to meet explosion proof criteria as jet fuel vapors may be present during the repair.; BENEFIT: The team will develop a business case analysis and transition plan to ensure that this new accelerated curing system will be available to the military as well as the commercial market.The immediate benefit is increasing the F-35 availability by reducing nutplate repair time.Production and repair of military aircraft as well as future military air vehicles will benefit from this technology. The commercial aircraft industry will also find this technology useful in the joining of composites."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Air Force platforms utilize nutplates to attach components when fasteners access is limited. Damaged nutplates require timely replacement and approved repair techniques mandate the use of certified adhesives, typically requiring a lengthy 24 hour cure at room temperature. Therefore, Air Force repair depots are faced with the difficult situation of performing high volume, timely nutplate repairs using materials initially optimized for long working time. Adhesive cure can be accelerated with the application of supplemental heating, but improper heating effects material properties and reduces nutplate performance. Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) proposes to develop an accelerated adhesive cure cycle and localized, controlled heating system capable of maintaining nutplate performance in restrictive repair environments (e.g. on-aircraft). During Phase I, CRG will develop cure profiles and a rapid heating system, leveraging commercially available components, to demonstrate feasibility through lab demonstrations. Phase II will result in fabrication of a refined prototype accelerated adhesive cure system that will be evaluated during field repairs. Phase III will focus on transitioning the technology to Air Force repair depots and commercialization of the rapid cure system.; BENEFIT: Operational Benefits:(1)Optimized cure cycle reduces MRO costs and down-time(2)Localized, controlled heating improves bondline reliability(3)Automated compensation for substructure reduces complexityCommercial Applications:(1)Aircraft manufacturing and MRO(2)Automotive and composite manufacturing(3)Adhesive and hardware distributors"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the Air Forces need for a self-referencing position system for 3D non-destructive evaluation (NDE) handheld tools of fifth-generation fighter aircraft, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop the new Aircraft Contour CorrElation SyStem (ACCESS). It is based on novel integration of COTS sensors combined with POC-developed algorithms running on real-time embedded hardware that can be easily attached to the existing handheld NDE tool and is co-aligned with its line of sight with a minimum impact to current application and process. Specifically, the innovations in ACCESS will enable the system to accurately determine its position in space and orientation (pitch, roll, yaw) at 30Hz in the aircraft coordinate frame. Hence, this low cost clip-on device offers the flexibility to use in a flightline environment during day or night and directly meets the requirement to capture precisely positioned measurement sets with an accuracy of 1 mm for use in change detection. In Phase I, POC will develop a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate its feasibility and a technology transition, integration, test, and validation plan. In Phase II, we will improve the prototype for an operational demonstration, update the transition plan and business case assessment, and finalize the integration and test\/validation plan.; BENEFIT: Military applications of the ACCESS system will include assembly, maintenance, and inspection of military aircraft and spacecraft to support accurate registration of inspection data to actual part locations. In addition, ACCESS can be integrated with metrology tools and incorporated by the U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin into the F-35 production, which will benefit from the increased tolerances for composite parts manufacturing, accelerated assembly process, and reduced rework needed for fitting parts into the aircraft. The ACCESS technology can be used for commercial airborne vehicles, in shipbuilding industry, in automotive industry and for many other applications where the high precision inspection and the automatic fitting process will reduce the overall cost of the products assembly. Furthermore, with minor modifications and optimizations, the ACCESS system can be positioned in the global non-destructive evaluation\/testing (NDE\/NDT) market as an augmentation for noncontact NDE\/NDT systems for inspection of large nonuniform structures with complex geometries."

Current coatings in use are based on polysulfide chemistry, contain chrome inhibitors, and do not consistently meet flexibility requirements of MIL-PRF-32239A. Luna will develop a next generation chrome-free flexible primer based on a unique hybrid resin chemistry that has been demonstrated via previous Luna efforts to offer epoxy-type rapid reactivity and good adhesion combined with excellent erosion, flexibility, weathering, and chemical resistance typical of polyurethane systems. The primer will be formulated to consistently meet 60% GE reverse impact requirements both pre- and post-Xenon arc testing, and will utilize high performance non-chrome based inhibitors. The final primer will be compatible with existing non-chrome pretreatments and topcoats already on the market to enable a a complete non-chrome aircraft outer mold line. The primer will below-VOC and non-HAPS to ensure compliance with EHS regulations.; BENEFIT: The nonchrome flexible primer will benefit the safety of Air Force and DoD personnel, commercial industry, and the environment.Because of increasingly strict regulations, demand for more environmentally friendly coatings, specifically chrome-free coatings, will continue to grow.The military has taken the lead in demanding complete chrome replacement and greener coating technologies, and the demand for greener coatings is growing in the commercial sector, too.Lunas nonchrome flexible primer is positioned to meet both demands for corrosion control and environmental acceptance.The coating will find use across the Air Force on large airframes such as the KC-46, C-17, C-130, or LRSB where high mechanical flexure has historically resulted in coating system failure. Reductions in corrosion across these structures will result in greater operational readiness and reduced sustainment costs over the platform life.Other commercial applications include numerous DoD aircraft anda wide variety of civilian passenger and transport aircraft."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Chromated polysulfide primers provide excellent corrosion protection and the high degree of flexibility required at seams and fasteners. However, hexavalent chromates are known carcinogens and their use is strictly regulated.In addition, polysulfides are highly viscous and the solvents used to reduce viscosity are regulated due to their impact on air quality.An ideal flexible aircraft coating would provide the elongation of a polysulfide primer, corrosion protection without adding chromates, and would have intrinsically low viscosity without high levels of solvents (VOCs).To meet these requirements new innovative materials are required. TDA Research, Inc. has designed a new flexible resin to provide the needed balance of flexibility and chemical resistance in a fast drying, VOC-compliant formula.Furthermore, TDA has developed a class of corrosion inhibitors that can dramatically increase corrosion protection performance through a targeted extended release mechanism.In this SBIR project, TDA will develop a flexible, yet chemically and water resistant primer using a new, proprietary low-viscosity starting material, combined with existing commercially available epoxy and amine compounds, and TDAs chromate-free inhibitors. We will work with a major coating manufacturer to combine our chromate-free inhibitors with the novel flexible resin, and formulate a flexible primer to meet MIL-PRF-32239.; BENEFIT: The VOC compliant, chromate-free flexible coatings are applicable to commercial as well as military aircraft.Further, the non-chrome corrosion inhibitor additives developed in this project can be added to other military and commercial primers and coatings wherever corrosion protection is required.They can be employed to protect metals from corrosion in a wide range of applications, including automotive, aerospace, bridges and building.They will provide effective corrosion protection without the health and environmental hazards of hexavalent chromates and without needing high levels of VOCs."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This proposal develops materials processing and fabrication techniques for the heterogeneous integration of compact magneto-optical isolators. Commercially available magneto-optical materials will be tested and evaluated. The magneto-optic materials will be qualified to meet project metrics of less than 1 dB\/cm bulk optical loss and Verdet constant at least -40 Rad\/T.m. Both ion slicing and mechanical processes will be explored for production of magneto-optic films no more than 300 micron x 50 microns x 10 microns. Magneto-optic materials will be attached to silicon wafers to demonstrate suitability for heterogeneous integration with silicon photonics. Design and simulation efforts will focus on efficient coupling of light between attached magneto-optic films and the photonic substrate. A particularly compelling aspect of this proposal is the exploration of latching magnet-less film that do not require any external magnetic field. Magnet-less isolator device structures have the potential to be simpler and more compact relative to devices that require attachment of permanent magnets. We anticipate that the materials engineering technologies developed during this effort will be transferable to a foundry at a national facility for integration into standard silicon photonics processes.; BENEFIT: Optical isolators are used in high-speed transmitters used in long haul communications and laser based systems used in defense and aerospace applications. Optical isolator products used in todays defense and commercial systems are discrete components that are difficult and tedious to harness and maintain in the field because of the high number of optical fiber interfaces and the associated number of optical couplers and connectors. To fully enjoy the benefits of photonics technology, it is critical to integrate the various components into a single substrate to reduce size, power consumption, and cost. Heterogeneous integration of optical isolator in a silicon photonic circuit enables high level of integration, improved interconnect density and longer distance links, while making use of the mature silicon semiconductor foundry process."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This proposal aims at developing an integrated approach for process and performance modeling in layered fibrous composites. It focuses on two critical issues in the manufacturing of fibrous composites: (i) modeling of voids, and (ii) modeling of wrinkles. Both aspects of micromechanical damage that get embedded in the morphology of the material at the time of its manufacture are known to have profound effect on the interfacial strength and fatigue life of the composite structural components. Process modeling part is concerned with the transient initial phase of the manufacturing of the material until the cure cycle is completed and it employs a two-pronged approach: A discrete micro-level (fiber-matrix level) approach, and a locally-homogenized macro-level (ply level) approach. Process Modeling effort is coupled with the Performance Modeling effort to investigate fatigue integrity of composites with embedded voids and wrinkles. A unique feature of our computational method is seamless and uniform coupling of the various hierarchical models in a variationally consistent fashion. A combined modeling, analysis and experimental validation program is envisioned for the calibration of theoretical and computational models as well as for sensitivity analysis of modeling parameters.; BENEFIT: This effort will result in a cost effective ICMSE based modeling and analysis tools for optimizing the processing technologies in the manufacturing of fibrous composites. The new methods developed under this project will be implemented in modular form so that they can be easily integrated into the research and commercial finite element analysis packages via User Defined Modular Interconnects typically provided by such programs. High end graphics tools will be integrated into the overall computational framework for easy comprehension of the intricate stress and interface fields that develop during the processing of composites. It will thus help material designers speed up the process design cycle for efficient manufacturing of fibrous and layered composites with very well calibrated properties."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This SBIR will model the effects of voids\/wrinkles on interlaminar strength and fatigue, detecting defect locations, testing curved specimens; and develop void\/wrinkle generation models for contoured composite structures to improve their integrity and reduce rejection rates.Accordingly, the target contribution of this effort has been summarized as understanding the effects of void and wrinkling defects on structural integrity such that useful accept\/reject criteria can be developed leading to reduced conservatism; and understanding generation of the critical defects including their location, size and shape; and possibly developing practical engineering criteria quantifying the critical defects.Phase I effort will determine the technical feasibility of the proposed concept to meet the Project objectives.During Phase II, a modeling and testing program will assess flaws versus change of strength\/fatigue performance of thick, curved composite structures.Testing will be of a scope to provide validation within the program budget, and may be limited to void or wrinkle flaws. The model will compare location of the critical flaws, quantify uncertainties in properties, and predict performance of the curved test specimens.; BENEFIT: The design and analysis tools capturing the effects of the manufacturing irregularities on structural integrity of contoured composite parts, implemented into commercial-off-the-shelf finite element analysis software, will create a huge impact on certification modeling of composites for engines and structures.Furthermore, quantifying the critical defects composite parts from cure-process simulation could be essential for closing the loop on effective control of the manufacturing process to prevent formation of the critical defects.The tools developed in this effort will enable effective integration of design, manufacturing, and certification of composite parts.The ability to design and build critical composite parts right the first time has been desperately needed by industry.For example, rotorcraft OEMs currently about 40% of the budget to design a new part is already spent before starting fatigue qualification.As a result, the part cannot be redesigned after problems are found; and the design can only be patched.The analysis tools enabling accurate structural strength and fatigue predictions for composite parts must capture their manufacturing complexity and variability to avoid costly trial-and-error iterations.Based on the feedback provided to Team Members, the Rotorcraft Industry and research labs are anxious to acquire the tools developed in the proposed effort for immediate applications in the new designs including CH-53K, CSAR, JMR and FVL aircraft as well the current and future design upgrades.Similar feedback has been received from the fixed-wing aircraft OEMs and the engine manufacturers.Also, naval and offshore applications including oil and gas industry markets, increasingly utilizing thick and curved thermosetting polymeric composite structures, are extremely interested in the enabling technology.We expect to capture these markets by 2020 if the proposed effort is funded."

The scanning Kelvin probe is a non-contact, non-destructive instrument designed to measure the surface work function difference between a scanning probe reference tip and sample surface, and can be directly correlated to the surface condition. In Phase I, Faraday and UDRI will demonstrate the ability to differentiate between a polyurethane rain erosion coating and an epoxy primer coating system using the scanning Kelvin probe, differentiate between a degraded and non-degraded polyurethane coating, epoxy primerand polyurethane\/epoxy primer stack up coating system under a high humidity, high temperature environment, and accelerate the transition toward a fieldable probe with preliminary design activities. In Phase II we will validate and deliver to the US Air Force a prototype field probe system that successfully maps out the coating system integrity on a stack of four representative outer mold line coating materials.; BENEFIT: The anticipated benefit of this SBIR program is the demonstration, development and deployment of a non-destructive evaluation technology for assessment of outer mold line coatings using a Scanning Kelvin Probe. This probe system will be portable, fieldable, and able to map out the condition of a variety of coatings across different structures. Commercial applications will be addressed after the Air Force applications have been advanced to a prototype stage and include application to military needs, commercial marine industries, as well as to the development of scanning Kelvin probes to identify a variety of corrosion issues in the aircraft and automotive industries."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the U.S. Air Force need for enhanced and augmented scanning Kelvin probe (SKP)-based techniques for the characterization and quantification of protective coating degradation and detection of corrosion, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Outer Potential Scanner (OPS) technique. It is based on the direct measurement of electric charge in the immovable, vibration-less electrode: Specifically, a new combination of additional electrodes and a novel induced charge transducer to measure the localization of charge on the tested surface as well as across the coating layer. As a result, OPS technology offers high sensitivity and unique capabilities in the design that allow field application. In Phase I, POC plans to demonstrate the feasibility of OPS technology to quantitatively measure coating degradation and detect corrosion in multilayer structures by building a single-probe conceptual prototype and evaluating it extensively under laboratory conditions, thus reaching TRL-3. In Phase II POC will design, build, and evaluate a prototype OPS multiprobe system to reveal the degree to which AFRL goals have been achieved and to validate meeting detection and quantification levels established in Phase I, reaching TRL-5. The prototype will be delivered to AFRL for further evaluation.; BENEFIT: Corrosion is possibly the most important factor in the inflation of life-cycle costs of military vehicles and structures. Therefore, effective life-cycle supervision of military assets requires an efficient health monitoring program to prevent, detect, and control corrosion. In this respect, nondestructive testing (NDT), nondestructive evaluation (NDE), and nondestructive inspection (NDI) can play important roles in this effort, particularly by monitoring, detecting, and reporting the early stages of corrosion before the damage becomes significant. It is of particular importance for the military, due to the long operational life cycle of military vehicles and structures. Being fast, noninvasive, and sensitive, the OPS technology and equipment are exact matches to this purpose. Corrosion monitoring, detection, and remediation are important not only for the military but for civilian vehicles and structures as well, where corrosion results in the loss of investment and short lifetimes of machinery and equipment."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Fully Adaptive Radar (FAR) has emerged as a key potential enabling technology to address a plurality of challenges facing the Warfighter in highly contested operations including Anti-Access, Area-Denial (A2AD). The ability to adapt all radar functions on-the-fly, including transmitter and receiver functions, while affording unprecedented new capabilities for spectrum dominance, immediately gives rise to a major systems analysis challenge since conventional radar modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools cannot support such a complicated system. Under this research project Information Systems Laboratories, Inc., (ISL), will develop a new Advanced Adaptive Radar M&amp;S (AARMS) tool to support all aspects of FAR development and M&amp;S and features; BENEFIT: The new M&amp;S tools developed under this effort will facilitate the development of advanced radar modes and capabilities needed to support missions in highly contested operations including Anti-Access, Area-Denial (A2AD). The tools will significantly reduce the cost of developing these new capabilities by avoiding extensive and costly data collection and flight test campaigns."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The goal of this project is to develop a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) capability for distributed, fully adaptive radar (FAR) that will enable algorithm development and testing on simulated, previously collected, and real-time streaming data.The foundation of the distributed sensor simulation is a previously developed M&amp;S tool for generating ground moving target indicator (GMTI) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar clutter samples using a sophisticated a physics-based bistatic scattering model (PBSM) capable of predicting the dynamically varying clutter patch statistical and spectral properties.A real-time experimental sensing capability is provided by the Cognitive Radar Engineering Workspace (CREW) in the Cognitive Radar Lab at The Ohio State University, one of the first cognitive-enabled research test beds in the world. The M&amp;S architecture will allow for transparent switching between the data sources, as well as between FAR algorithms that drive the sensing.In Phase I, we will develop the architecture, the application programming interface (API) layers for simulated and experimental data sources, and a basic distributed FAR algorithm to control the sensing, and demonstrate the real-time operation in the Cognitive Radar Lab.; BENEFIT: Radar systems are crucial for robust surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance in all weather conditions and over wide ranges of interest.Anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) environments are especially challenging, therefore it is necessary to develop innovative signal and data processing techniques to provide the next level of sensing capabilities to the warfighter.Distributed radar and fully adaptive radar (FAR) systems seek to exploit all available degrees of freedom on transmit and receive in order to maximize radar system performance and thus offer much promise for improved sensing as well as the creation of new sensing modalities.Modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) and real-time experimentation play a critical role for FAR algorithm development due to the need for dynamic generation of representative scenarios. A key gap in the Air Forces previously developed radar M&amp;S tools is the lack of a comprehensive, dynamic distributed radar scenario generation capability. This project will develop a fundamental M&amp;S capability for distributed, fully adaptive radar that will enable algorithm development and testing on simulated, previously collected, and real-time streaming data.The M&amp;S architecture will allow for transparent switching between the data sources, as well as between FAR algorithms that drive the sensing.The ability to easily interchange sensing and processing modules will enable collaboration between researchers in industry, academia, and the Air Force for development of improved radar sensing capabilities."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the U.S. Air Force need for a low-profile multiband airborne satellite communications antenna, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Optically Scanned Conformal Aperture-limited, Antenna Array (OSCAR). This device is based on a multiband, low-SWaP (size, weight, and power) conformal antenna design utilizing a dielectric polymer substrate. Specifically, the innovation in the probe feed of the antenna will allow more antenna elements to be placed in a small area. Optical beam forming of array elements will enable the OSCAR to perform wideband, beamforming and steering without detrimental beam squinting as the frequency increases. POC anticipates low-profile multiband (X\/Ka\/Ku\/Q), high-gain equivalent isolated radiated power &gt;45 dBw, which is consistent with deployment on Group-5-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and minimally affects aerodynamics. In Phase I POC will develop and test a low-profile multiband conformal antenna through simulation, analysis, prototyping, and trade-space analysis of key performance parameters (frequency, gain, physical footprint, beamwidth, weight, and cost). In Phase II, POC plans to optimize OSCAR for USAF UAVs, quantifying performance metrics and enhancing the design through optimization, prototype fabrication, and validation testing cycles in a representative environment to reach TRL-5\/-6. Finally POC will prepare a transition plan for OSCAR.; BENEFIT: OSCAR will be a high-gain conformal antenna with design flexibility for many size-constrained systems. The proposed technology can be applied to wireless communication and electronic warfare, as well as tagging, tracking, and location identification of different targets for border control. Its compact design can provide an excellent feed system for a wide range of civilian and commercial radiating elements. POCs OSCAR system can also be applied commercially, where it will find use in transmitters and receivers for telecommunications, sensors, and other applications requiring long-range data transfer, e.g., satellite uplink and downlink antenna systems; and for broadband data links for aircraft and radar in commercial airliners. The conformal structure of the OSCAR can be applied to antenna transmitters on water towers, buses, trains, and vehicles, for high-bandwidth data transfer such as WiMAX, and for wireless USB. POCs OSCAR also has applications in SATCOM on the move (SOTM) for TV and radio transmission and reception systems."

(SI2) will enable low cost electronically steered multiband SATCOM capability on aircraft and Group 5-sized UAVs with our innovative phased array technology. The low profile array will provide full transmit and receive operation over multiple commercial and military satellite bandswith full azimuth and hemispherical elevation coverage. The proposed array aperture is based on SI2s proven array technology, which enables excellent scan beam scanning performance over very wide bandwidths.In PH I, SI2 will design a conformal electronically steered antenna aperture. We will also simulate the achievable performance on a representative UAV platform, and develop a manufacturing and structural integration plan for the multiband phased array technology. SI2 will validate our design and manufacturing approach via fabrication and test of prototype arrays to demonstrate TRL 4 at the conclusion of the PH I program. In PH II, we will optimize RF performance of the conformal array and thoroughly test its performance. The most economical designs and manufacturing methods will be used to minimize cost.; BENEFIT: The Air Force has the urgent need for transmitting and receiving BLOS data updates during mission execution. These mission data updates include lower data rate transmission of Air Tasking Order (ATO) updates, target position updates, imagery intelligence and streaming video. Currently the most common technology used for military and commercial SATCOM is a parabolic reflector antenna on a gimballed mount that points the antenna at the satellite of interest. While this solution is practical for ground-based operations, it is bulky and cumbersome to implement on airborne platforms, particularly UAVs where SWAP requirements are very stringent. This array will enable multiband SATCOM capabilities on UAVs in a conformal and aerodynamic profile and eliminate the need for large mechanically steered reflector antennas.This conformal phased array technology can be applied to any commercial manned or unmanned platform where it is desired to eliminate bulky SATCOM antennas. The anticipated low cost of the conformal arrays will make it an attractive option for commercial aircraft."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Agile RF Systems LLC has proposed a new breakthrough in conformal phased array technology through a new hybrid scan antenna architecture. This approach combines the advantages of conventional phased arrays with pragmatic low cost mechanically actuated subsystems to realize a very low profile two-dimensionally scanned antenna. Through this combination of technologies, a much lower system cost can be realized while eliminating performance degrading drag from the aircraft. As UAS platforms get smaller and become more capable, low cost and low profile solutions are even more critical to operate these systems autonomously and beyond line of sight. Furthermore, the inherent reconfigurability of the design lends itself to multiband SATCOM realization. The building blocks all scale to support each of the bands while active feed networks can share space in order to minimize the overall installation size.; BENEFIT: As the deployment of UAS becomes more and more ubiquitous, the need for conformal communication antenna technologies that support either line of sight or in particular beyond line of sight (through use of SATellite COMmunication networks) becomes increasingly critical to UAS wide spread utilization. This low profile antenna breakthrough is a great fit for all airborne (manned and unmanned) SATCOM antenna needs because it eliminates flight endurance degrading drag. By offering a multiband, low cost and low profile alternative antenna to gimbaled SATCOM antenna solutions requiring substantial height, future UAS designs can take advantage of optimal aerodynamic shaping to achieve maximum flight endurance and efficiency for USAF and civil communication services."

Cyan Systems proposes a compact high definition IRST with small pixels to make possible advanced tracking error on both passive and active type sensing modalities. Cyans small pixel technology makes it possible to reduce the size of the optics dramatically while still providing dramatic resolution at longer ranges that existing larger pixel IRST technologies. Cyans key innovations allow a much smaller HD format array which results in a reduction in the size of the optic (IFOV = dpix\/fl) so that the resolution improves with smaller pixels. At the same time the smaller sensor uses less detector materials and results in a size reduction in the sensor package as well as the optics.; BENEFIT: 1. High Definition, high resolution Digital IR Sensors for compact and lightweight WFOV IRST with better performance than current generation IRSTs.2. Increased NEP from small pixels, leading to increased detection range, reduced false alarms and better stand off ID and recognition range.3. Advanced real-time multi-target tracking with symbology and ability to track target deeper in clutter with small pixel pooling\/correlation tracking.4. Improved circular error probability on fine tracking such as plume hard body aimpoint and related complex tracking of dim fast moving objects.Spatial and temporal oversampling to insure good well capacity and frame rates at the same time.5. Refined image processing algorithms that are both effective at detecting low observables suitable for implementation in compact FPGA and GPU processing modules6. Specification for both a prototype compact WFOV\/Panoramic lens and compact optics."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the Air Force need for a deployable lightweight upper air sensing system, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Portable Air Data LIDAR (PADL). It is based on a compact and modular LIDAR design consisting of a tri-wavelength miniature pulsed LIDAR module with control, power management, and signal processing hardware and software components. The novel system design will enable the ground-based weather sensor system to measure critical weather parameters in a completely integrated package, unlike current portable weather systems, and is employable at any remote location due to its lightweight portability and low power requirements. As a result, this technology offers a reliable means to seed military weather forecasting models with more reliable local data from global locations and to provide actionable data from which to improve tactical decisions in the field. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate feasibility of the PADL by determining the optimal system design, factoring in system size, weight, and performance requirements. Trade-offs between system parameters will be analyzed according to the DoD priorities, and a final system design will be prepared for Phase II implementation. In Phase II, POC will build and optimize the PADL prototype, reaching technology readiness level (TRL)-6.; BENEFIT: The development of PADL will benefit government and commercial sectors in many ways. For the government it will provide a man-portable, reliable, small-size, easy-to-deploy LIDAR technology to accurately measure multiple weather parameters in the upper air column for successfully conducting various military missions. PADL will also help the military take and disseminate local observations and provide mission-tailored global forecasts, and assist civilian aviation by providing weather briefings, forecasts, and warnings. Commercial benefits include wind flow monitoring near civil structures and other buildings, wind flow monitoring near wind turbines, and analysis of rotor downwash on personnel and parked aircraft at airports and building helipads. The proposed PADL, with minor modifications, can be used as a research tool to study the lower atmospheric phenomena and develop new weather models and forecasting methods."

        "abstract": "This study addresses a parametric analysis of technology alternatives resulting in the design of a wideband dual polarized HF antenna covering 3 to 30 MHz supporting transmit and receive functions with an instantaneous bandwidth of 10 MHz. A benchmark will be developed of conventional large size antennas to determine the best possible performance unconstrained by size. These candidates will then be reduced in size (1 to 10 feet) to determine tradeoffs compared to the benchmark antennas. Various technologies willbe applied in both receive and transmit to expand performance including: Receive - active circuitry; Transmit -fast switching antenna tuners - lossy impedance matching; a hybrid method using both lossy matching and switching in lumped elements to provide wider bands of coverage. A combination of computational electromagnetics software, numerical electromagnetics code, and advanced design system software will be used for antenna and circuit modeling. Matlab will be used for the Pareto optimization. The resulting design is an antenna with a few bands that would need to be switched with the antennas being truly instantaneous inside each band. A commercialization strategy is provided demonstrating how the resulting antenna design can be used in governmentand commercial systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Toyon Research Corp. proposes to develop innovative cognitive processing algorithms to perform ultra-fast identification and classification (uFIC) of structural information directly from 3-dim LiDAR point-cloud data. The proposed algorithms are based on a model of human cognition, which involves coarsely processing data to identify regions of interest (ROI), and subsequently increasing the granularity of detection to resolve objects and patterns. Like the human visual cortex, our algorithmic cortex is composed of several layers, which filter and interpret local point-data correlations at different scales using simple geometric models. Multi-scale point and group associations are stored in efficient membership structures, which are built at each layer and refined with low complexity updates. The resulting system is highly tunable, via a number of objective- function parameters, and adaptable to various object geometries and signal modalities. Furthermore, the system is capable of real-time performance, with immediate extensions employing massively parallel GPU and distributed CPU architectures such as OpenMPI.; BENEFIT: The tool will provide an intuitive user interface for visualizing, searching, and annotating 3-dim LiDAR datasets in real-time. The prototype will be based on a geographic information system (GIS) framework with a graphical user interface, 3D environment models, terrain and overlay visualizations, import\/export of standard data formats, and accompanying CAD tool to generate synthetic models for training. The recognition algorithms will consist of low-level geometry extraction codes coupled with a trainable software stack (modeled on human neural anatomy and deep learning architectures) that can exploit training data. The resulting tool will enable an analyst to load up a point-cloud file, automatically find geometric objects from a training set, and visualize them using in a scene using simple shading and wireframe models."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the Air Force need for Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capability that uses Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Highly Parallel LIDAR-based Automated Target Recognition (PLATR) system based on an innovative combination of target isolation, target pose estimation and target recognition methods that can be computed in a parallel manner. Specifically, the innovation in efficient and parallel point cloud data processing for ATR will enable the PLATR system to reliably detect military ground vehicles in a variety of landscapes. As a result, this technology offers high probability of detection and real-time operation in a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) processing hardware, which directly address the Air Force requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the PLATR system by developing a Technology Readiness Level (TRL)-3 prototype. In Phase II, POC plans to build a TRL-6 prototype implemented in a low SWaP processing hardware.; BENEFIT: The quick automated sensor analysis offered by the PLATR system will not only save costly expert analysis, but will also be extremely valuable in time-critical mission scenarios in which human lives are at stake. After successful integration with a unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and once deployed, the PLATR technology will warn the warfighter of potentially hostile enemy vehicles in a timely manner. The proposed technology also has significant commercial applications, including for law enforcement, border control, and traffic management."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Our goal for a successful Phase 1 and 2 SBIR effort is to develop a design and measurement methodology for RF microelectronic components which enables real time, non-invasive authentication and reliability determination. Our unique and innovative approach will authenticate components using statistical analysis of characteristic electromagnetic and functional fingerprints exhibited at external nodes. Specifically, this proposal describes an approach to uncover variation sensitive circuit nodes in state-of-the-art Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs), Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCOs), and Active Mixers. We outline configuration methodologies that amplify process differences to statistically enhance the process differences without resulting in significant performance or circuit area penalties. We also propose evaluation of these methodologies for their ability to exhibit transistor wear characteristics over the circuits operational lifetime. Finally, we propose measurements of existing state-of-the-art fabricated VCOs in multiple technology nodes to determine out-of-the-box measures of performance variation for comparison. These measurements consist of EM signal injection into various circuit nodes to observe the statistical variation produced from parts from the identical fabrication run.; BENEFIT: The BRC-OSU team anticipates that the circuit authentication technologies developed under this effort will have high commercialization potential in the private sector supporting both DoD and commercial customers. Our team recognizes the need for a circuit authentication and reliability determination technology that is able to rapidly and non-destructively evaluate the authenticity and reliability of whole production lots of microelectronic components with sensitivity to advanced counterfeit, subversively modified and aged devices and will tailor the technology developed under this program to these unique needs of the high reliability commercial and DoD market. Our team anticipates that this unique approach will be of high interest primarily to DoD end users (prime contractors and armed services) as well as original component manufacturers. Our team envisions offering a product for sale only to DoD end users and original component manufacturers to ensure the integrity of the measurement system against reverse engineering by foreign entities."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In this Air Force SBIR program Alphacore, Inc. proposes to develop and implement integrated circuit (IC) design and analysis techniques for authentication, identification, and reliability monitoring of radio frequency (RF) microelectronics.The specific devices under test (DUTs) targeted in this work are configurable low noise amplifiers (LNAs), voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), and active mixers.The developed techniques provide less than 20% area and less than 15% performance overhead in key parameters (e.g., gain, noise figure, phase noise, IIP3, P1dB etc.) as compared with state-of-the-art performance at equal power.The techniques provide greater than 90 percent confidence in authenticity and greater than 99 percent unique identification.The developed techniques will provide non-destructive evaluation to determine unique chip identifiers (UIDs) for authentication as well as monitor for degradation and flag an impending failure.BIST and DUT will be co-designed during the design phase to alleviate any negative performance impact while achieving high characterization accuracy. UIDs will be generated by digitally coding performance parameters that are characterized by the BIST circuit. Multiple supply (Vdd) states will be used to sensitize the circuit performance to process, thereby increasing the hamming distance (HD) of the UIDs generated.; BENEFIT: The total cost of the employment of counterfeit electronics can be estimated as 100 billion U.S. dollars per year. The issue of counterfeit electronics is growing and while there is a critical need for solutions in the DoD supply chain, the need is also imminent for other high-reliability electronic industries, such as medical, aerospace and automotive industries.The results of this work are built-in self-test (BIST) IP blocks for RF electronics, including LNAs, mixers, and VCOs. These BIST circuits monitor the performance of the device under test (DUT) periodically to predict the remaining lifetime. The readout from the BIST circuit will also be used to generate an unclonable unique ID (UID) for authenticating, identifying, and tracking chips in the supply chain. Cloned, recycled, or unauthorized excess chips can immediately be flagged using the UIDs that are not in the vendor database."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of designing, implementing and producing novel low-cost, easy to use, microsystems for authentication and end-of-life prediction of integrated circuits undergoing a die extraction and reassembly (DER) process.The significance of this proposal is the possibility of developing novel solid-state nanoionic based Combating Die and IC Recyclingstructures and devices that will be available to provide enhanced trust in the electronic supply chain of devices undergoing DER in the DoD but also for common microcircuits in the DoD and in any supply chain that requires enhanced trust and security for its microelectronics circuits, i.e. avionic, space, automotive, medical.The proposed\/envisioned solution takes advantage of nanoionics properties of chalcogenide materials, and will be implemented as a novel nanoionic solid state microsystem to be inserted in the cavity of a microelectronic package with another die\/IC that underwent DER in order to be inserted in a military approved package. Such nano-ionic microsystem will be able to let the user of the microcircuit know, once repackaged, if it has been used (powered-ON) and also for how long it has been used since DER by a simple electrical test\/query of dedicated test pins on the package.; BENEFIT: Anticipated control of the growth-rate of the electrodeposits will be of immediate use for implementing CDIR circuits for ICs undergoing a DER process within the DoD supply chain, but also for other industry supply-chains requiring anti-counterfeit solutions. The phase I effort not only will demonstrate the capability of creating CDIR stand-alone microcircuits, but will also open the possibility of integrating such structures in new designs as the materials and processing techniques allow for integration on CMOS processes. Additionally, there are also application beyond the integrated circuit application: they could be used for CDIR and run time estimation of PCB used in electrical system, and also in additional systems in industry as the chalcogenide material have been shown to be implementable on flexible substrate, which would allow them to be implemented around pipes or other structures.The Phase I study will already result with significant progress in meeting the overall objectives of the program since both controllable electrodeposit growth-rate andmobile\/bench-top characterization system will be demonstrated in actual laboratorytests. This level of progress is not typical for a SBIR Phase I study.The progress expectations are based on the facts that Alphacore and ASU already have developed and fabricated similar fully functional nanoionic components, and are experienced in tester system design.The total cost of the employment of counterfeit electronics can be estimated as billions of dollars in the USA alone. The issue of counterfeit electronics is growing and while there is a critical need for CDIR devices in the DoD supply chain, the need is also imminent for other high-reliability electronic industries, such as medical, aerospace and automotive industries."

The Phase I study will analyze and evaluate the HiMAE architecture and demonstrate its feasibility to meet the Air Force SBIR program objective.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In navigation warfare (Navwar), it is imperative for military GPS receivers to possess a high-performance engine for fast direct acquisition of GPS military codes (i.e., the M-code and\/or P(Y)-code on L1 and\/or L2) under a combined jamming and spoofing attack in order to provide an assured position, navigation and time (PNT) solution for critical missions. To this end, we propose to develop a software-defined radio (SDR) approach for the development of a direct joint acquisition of M-code and Y-code in quadrature (DINAMYQ) engine. Four enabling techniques are set forth, namely, (i) simultaneous search over multiple code phases, (ii) simultaneous search over multiple frequency bins, (iii) post-correlation coherent integration with data bit removal for anti-jamming, and (iv) coherent I and Q combining for joint M- and P(Y)-code acquisition, together with an optimized reconfigurable FPGA and embedded processor implementation. In Phase I, we will develop the DINAMYQ mechanization and optimize its performance using the M Prime-code generated by an RF signal simulator to meet the targeted time to first fix (120 seconds) under 51 dB jamming over signal power ratio. The Phase I effort will also develop a prototyping approach for Phase II demo.; BENEFIT: When successful, the proposed DINAMYQ technological approach will enable fast direct acquisition of military GPS signals in the presence of jamming with improved continuity, availability, and accuracy in GPS-challenged environments, which is significant for practically all military applications. For the civilian market, the largest commercialization potential will be achieved when the proposed technology with fast acquisition\/re-acquisition capability is applied to enable lane-level accuracy in automotive safety applications for connected cars and self-driving cars particularly in urban canyon environments where GNSS signals are severely blocked but are briefly available at intersections intermittently."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: QuinStar Technology proposes to develop a 45 W, high-efficiency solid-state power amplifier (SSPA), operating over the 43.5 to 45.5 GHz band, for low-cost SATCOM ground terminals. This will be accomplished by employing two major innovations. First, we plan to utilize wide bandgap Gallium Nitride (GaN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) device technology to fabricate our high-efficiency MMICs. Operating at a higher voltage (typically 28 V versus 4 V for GaAs), GaN permits higher power densities which results in lower matching and cell combining losses, making these MMICs more efficient. Secondly, we are proposing to utilize a switching mode of operation (inverse Class-F) to enhance the device efficiency. While this method has demonstrated efficiencies of 80% at 2 GHz, these levels have not yet been realized at Q-band frequencies. Computer simulations indicate that by using this method, device PAE levels of 60-65% are possible at 44 GHz. Finally, MMIC simulations at Q-band frequencies indicate that even with circuit losses, we can still maintain the chip efficiency above 40%. The preliminary layout and performance of this MMIC is included in the proposal, together with the overall SSPA configuration (including the combiner) and projected performance.; BENEFIT: Anticipated Benefits:Currently the efficiency state-of-the-art for power MMICs is in the range of 15% at Q-band frequencies. With packaging, combining networks and power conditioning, the amplifier efficiency rarely exceeds 10%, and is often in the single digit range. Our approach will result in a power amplifier with an efficiency of 35% or better. The impact on system prime power and waste heat is illustrated by the following example: With todays technology, using 10% and 45 W for its DC-to-RF efficiency and output power respectively, the SSPA will require 450 W of DC prime power. However, with this new amplifier technology (35% DC-to-RF efficiency), the SSPA will require only 129 W of DC power, a savings of over 300 W. In addition to this substantial reduction in prime power, this high-efficiency SSPA approach will greatly reduce the load on the waste heat removal system, and thereby reduce its cost. Furthermore, with a more efficient amplifier, we anticipate less self-heating and therefore improved reliability. Due to the exponential relationship between temperature and lifetime, this reduction in dissipated power, and thereby temperature, can result in a lifetime improvement of 100 times or more.Commercial Applications:Applications for high-efficiency Q-band amplifiers abound in the commercial market segment as well as DoD.These include Q-band SATCOM applications for the Army to radar applications for all military services in the adjacent radar bands (33 to 38 GHz). Clearly, once demonstrated, this high-efficiency technology can be easily transferred to lower frequencies. For radar, high efficiency is particularly important for airborne applications, such as UAVs and fire control radars, where the prime power is limited. In the commercial segment, a massive market exists for high-efficiency SSPA to replace aging tubes in SATCOM terminals. Additional markets include airborne terminals for commercial airlines using SATCOM, emerging communications applications in the 38-39 GHz range, weather and environmental monitoring radars operating in the 34 to 36 GHz band, aircraft landing systems to enhance or replace Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) with EVFS at 35 GHz, Security and Surveillance radars for commercial, industrial and municipal applications and helicopter collision avoidance radars for brown-out and obstacle avoidance.Further, this technology is scalable. By using power combining technology, we can provide SSPAs with output power levels well beyond the current goals of this program. For example, with the proposed 8 W chip and a 16-way combiner, power levels above 100 W are readily attainable."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: 3D model generation from long-range ISR video is an important part of Special Forces operation planning. The current workflow is highly manual and time consuming. Existing automated algorithms for 3D reconstruction from high- and variable-zoom FMV are fraught with failure due to both practical issues (e.g. metadata handling) and algorithm limitations that result in poor quality models. Kitware proposes TeleSculptor: Semantic 3D Scene Modeling from High Zoom Reconnaissance Video. Telesculptor builds on Kitware&apos;s established software tools (Burn-OUT, MAP-Tk, Super3D) that provide per-frame metadata burn-in detection, erroneous KLV handling, camera calibration for high-zoom FMV including planar scenes, and dense surface estimation. Telesculptor breaches the algorithmic barriers by incorporating semantic reasoning into 3D reconstruction. It will segment the video frames into semantic regions like ground, wall, door, window, and vegetation using the latest advances in deep learning. It will use these image segmentations to jointly estimate a 3D surface and a segmentation of that 3D surface into semantic categories. The semantic labels allow local geometric constraints that improve 3D model accuracy. Our proposal will enable fully automated reconstruction of high quality 3D models, saving countless man-hours. It will enable 3D exploitation of hours FMV that would otherwise sit idle in the archives.; BENEFIT: The primary benefit of the proposed work is a solution to problem of automated 3D scene reconstruction from high zoom aerial reconnaissance video. Our software will directly benefit mission planning at AFSOC, for example. In the time it takes one user to build a model from video, our system could build thousands of models from thousands of videos automatically. This could change the way video is collected and used for mission planning. In addition to military applications, the same technology applies to commercial and humanitarian applications in the budding commercial UAS market. 3D models from video can be used to measure material displacement in mining and damage in disaster recovery operations.A secondary benefit of the proposed work is that all of the developed technology will be releasedas open source. The existence of the open source solution will benefit the research community, and the research community will, in turn, enhance the software at no cost to the program. The open source toolkit will also directly benefit Kitware by creating more consulting contracts surrounding the technology."

This reconnaissance is often completed with passive full motion video with the platform flying an orbit. While high-fidelity automatically-generated 3D models of the viewed scene would greatly benefit analyst understanding of the environment, frequent zoom changes and switching between color, electro-optical, and infrared sensing greatly complicates model generation. Neya Systems proposes to develop a 3D scene model generation capability that is not hindered by frequent zoom changes or changes between color, electro-optical and infrared video. A performance model will be developed that characterizes expected accuracy of the reconstruction.; BENEFIT: The benefits of three-dimension (3D) context for tactical and ISR missions are widely recognized and range from providing the spatial awareness to the Warfighter during tactical operations to providing the common spatial representation for multi-INT data fusion during manual and\/or automated ISR exploitation. By providing this 3D information regardless of the video characteristics used to generate the information, our solution greatly increases the scenarios within which this capability can be used."

(VSI) proposes to develop automated 3D reconstruction techniques from narrow field-of-view video imagery.Such imagery presents multiple challenges:limited ground coverage, variable image resolution, and limited viewpoint diversity.STR and VSI have developed a voxel-based reconstruction framework called Belief Propagation Volumetric Reconstruction (BPVR) which excels at reconstructing detailed 3D models from aerial imagery.This technique simultaneously optimizes constraints from all data sources to produce a single composite 3D model, and works particularly well in challenging textureless areas.However, one current weakness of this algorithm is its dependency on viewpoint-rich orbitsthe 3D model quality degrades with low viewpoint diversity.Stereo-based 3D reconstruction approaches, on the other hand, perform well with limited viewpoints.The downside to stereo approaches, such as Semi-Global Matching (SGM), is that they output depth maps for each image and not a single 3D world.We propose to combine the performance of stereo under low-viewpoint diversity with the principled integration of the BPVR framework to generate an accurate and robust composite 3D scene model from narrow field-of-view video.; BENEFIT: The goal of this SBIR program is to provide users, such as Special Forces analysts, with high-precision 3D models for mission planning purposes by providing them with automated 3D reconstruction tools that replace their current manual model building pipeline.Our 3D reconstruction capabilities will be designed and validated to process practical sources of scene imagery such as narrow field-of-view video from unmanned aerial vehicle platforms.In particular, our tool will be robust to limited coverage area, variable image resolution, limited viewpoint diversity and variable image quality.In addition to developing a valuable tool for DoD image analysts, the robust 3D modeling capability has commercial applicability for drone security and geospatial data analysis problems.Commercial applications thus include drone system plug-in modules as well as geographic information system tools."

The technology will be evaluated for compatibility with MWIR wavelengths and the IRCM mission.For Phase I Boulder Nonlinear Systems and our teaming partners, Exciting Technology and LC Vision, propose to build wide angle beam steering components and demonstrate steering two separate MWIR wavelengths to the same spatial position. We will also investigate the feasibility of developing modified ferroelectric liquid crystal mixtures for MWIR applications.Efforts to mitigate wavelength dispersion will be explored and different switches for the beam control system will also be investigated. Finally we will design a prototype beam control system to be implemented in Phase II.; BENEFIT: The effort proposed here represents an improvement to IRCM systems in that it has the potential to replace existing mechanical systems with a low C-SWaP non-mechanical broadband beam steering solution. Several DoD and commercial airborne platforms could benefit from a low C-SWaP IRCM beam control system. In addition, other MWIR applications such as passive sensing would benefit."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Optical beam steering has a wide range of applications in optical memory, optical communication, and free-space interconnections. A variety of techniques to implement optical beam steering have been reported by means of electromechanical, acousto-optic, and electro-optic effects. Optical phased-array beam steering implemented in lithium tantalate, lithium niobate crystals, and liquid crystal were reported. Fontus Applied Technologies proposes to develop a novel MWIR beam steering system, which is based on a novel design to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several critical areas.; BENEFIT: Success in the Phase I effort will lead to the commercial fabrication of new generation of MWIR beam steering system. This advanced device will offer the potential for significant performance improvements in military and commercial applications. These advanced devices will have great applications in military, space, industrial, and consumer sectors. Examples are military target designator."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Current approaches for advanced multi-sensor feature-aided kinematic tracking, including distributed multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT), cannot contend with informative but sparse information that arises from some classes of physical sensors as well as from human input to the fusion process. The difficulty stems from the fact that, to deal with this multi-INT fusion challenge, computationally intractable hypothesis tree depths are required, even with efficient distributed MHT solutions.Graph-based tracking (GBT) methods have shown significant promise in providing scalable multi-sensor tracking solutions. Unfortunately, existing methodologies are not directly applicable to the multi-INT fusion challenge.Under this effort, STR will leverage and extend MHT and GBT technology to address the multi-INT fusion challenge. Additionally, we will introduce solution refinement and uncertainty representations via advanced machine learning technology. The refinements are based on efficient track-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.The STR multi-INT data association solver (MIDAS) will exploit and advance the complementary nature of MHT, GBT, and MCMC solution paradigms, yielding an effective and scalable tool for large-scale forensic surveillance. Testing will be based on simulated scenarios and several multi-INT scenarios of current interest to AFRL.; BENEFIT: Under this effort, STR will develop the multi-INT data association solver (MIDAS) that will provide an innovative fusion capability that significantly extends the state-of-the art in MHT-based, graph-based, and machine-learning algorithms. MIDAS will enable fusion over large temporal and spatial datasets, over a wide range of sensor types with highly disparate data flows."
