        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Hypersonic flight environments can include vibration with high frequency spectral content that is difficult to simulate.This high frequency vibration may adversely affect the accuracy of guidance and control sensors, so it is very important to the Air Force Research Laboratory to be able to recreate the vibration in a way that allows sensor performance to be evaluated.Motion platforms such as the KHILS ISTAT facility have been built for this purpose, but current technology only partially addresses this need.Present frequency capability is limited to about 500 Hz, while 1000 Hz bandwidth would ideally be available.Dynamic Structures and Materials (DSM) believes that these needs can be met through a high frequency motion simulator that uses a parallel kinematic actuator (PKA).High performance linear motors will be used with a novel approach to construction of the joints to provide high performance, reliable motion simulation.This actuator will be combined with a flexible, open control architecture and high resolution sensors, resulting in a system that is maintainable and able to deliver the high acceleration and precision necessary for hypersonic flight vibration simulation.; BENEFIT: The most direct benefit of the proposed development effort is improved fidelity in hardware-in-the-loop simulations at the KHILS facility.This will lead to better accuracy and more confidence in the performance estimates for US interceptors and similar hypersonic vehicles.After successful deployment at KHILS, there will be other opportunities to apply this technology.There are other flight simulation facilities such as the ones at USAF AEDC that might benefit from a similar capability.While remaining compliant with ITAR and other restrictions on distribution, DSM will seek to market related products for high performance vehicle simulation; this is a well-developed industry that would benefit from the increased capability described.Hexapods have many applications outside vehicle simulation, so it may also be feasible to market similar devices for wire bonders or similar high speed assembly applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the need for CubeSat-compatible, dimensionally stable, high strain composite materials and booms for future RF antennas, Roccor proposes to develop DiSH technology. DiSHTM laminates are rollable to achieve high linear and volumetric compaction ratios and dimensionally stable to minimize deformations from temperature variations and on-orbit operations.  Further, DiSHTM laminates are designed to be compatible with a range of structural architectures from simple tape-spring and tube booms where cost and simplicity drive program goals or more complex structures (truss and tension-stabilized systems) when necessary.  During Phase I, Roccor and our RF system partner, ASTRA LLC, will focus on designing, manufacturing, and testing highly stable and electrically functional DiSH laminates.  Requirements will encompass all mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and thermal performance goals of interest to the Air Force.  From these requirements, a CubeSat-compatible point design for a DiSH boom system will be developed for testing during Phase II.; BENEFIT: The overarching Phase I objective is to conduct an preliminary design-analysis-fabrication-test loop for a DiSH Boom capable of meeting requirements for a variety of future Air Force RF antenna and instruments (e.g., magnetometer, E-field, dipole\/loop, and communications antenna), and clearly identify engineering development risks that must be addressed to ultimately ensure adequate performance of these booms on-orbit.  The emphasis will be on proving that the unique combination of hybrid-fiber composite laminate designs and high-strain surface treatments can enable high-precision and stability in the deployed boom  far in excess of COTS systems on the market today  and with a simple and low-cost system design.  The anticipated result of Phase I is definition of a family of DiSH laminate designs capable of meeting a range of deployable RF instrument and antenna designs of interest to the Air Force, qualification of these designs through coupon thermal\/mechanical testing and component RF transparency testing, and development of a conceptual design of a DiSH Boom system to be further developed during Phase II.  In addition to DoDs CubeSat RF antenna market discussed above, Roccor has identified two other markets where the proposed technology could have considerable impact: a) portable and man-packable deployable antennas for military ground troops and b) deployable apertures for communication satellites and space exploration vehicles."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Materials utilized for 3-5 micron IR optics, have historically been limited to chalcogenide glasses and semiconductor crystals because organic polymers are strongly IR absorbing in this regime, due to the presence of carbon hydrogen (C-H), or other carbon-heteroatom (C-X) vibrational modes. Polymers are still desirable for these applications because they can be readily processed\/molded and have proven to be a low cost, lightweight, and mechanically robust material in visible range optics. Research at the University of Arizona demonstrated that sulfur based co-polymers can provide a window of transparency in the IR range and the properties of these thermosets can be adjusted to enable processing into optical quality components. This is due to the thermal reversibility of the disulfide bonds in these polymers which endow them with thermal-healing characteristics. Chemists at Luna Innovations have identified a set of inorganic monomer components that can stabilize sulfur based thermosets without the use of hydrocarbons. These materials will be thermally pliable for ease of processing while being highly transparent in the mid-IR range due to the elimination of C-H vibrational modes. Luna will develop this polymeric platform to provide low cost, lightweight, mechanically robust components for IR optics and imaging.BENEFIT:The proposed polymeric materials development would enable a transformative and revolutionary technological advance in IR imaging science. When fully developed, the inorganic hybrid polysulfane materials will be poised for implementation and commercialization.The system will enable optical material manufacturers to produce inexpensive lenses and windows for use in IR optics and guidance systems for the Air Force and other defense agencies.The technology will initially be developed to provide optical material for US security and defence applications, however, the IR optical products will have applicability to a number of military and commercial applications.The ability to melt process IR optics will enable cost effective production of a number of telecommunication and camera products that utilize the mid-IR range. Aerospace, security and communication applications are just a few of the industries that stand to benefit from these optical polymers."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The use of optical fibers for the transport and distribution of RF signals brings the benefits of both worlds at the fingertip of the network engineer! A Hybrid Broadband Optical Link enables such heterogeneous network, an end-to-end network solution that leverages the unique features and capabilities offered by RF and optical networks. The use of an optical fiber backbone to provide high data rate interconnection between antenna base stations in broadband RF networks offers significant advantages while supporting both wired and wireless connectivity. Optical link capacity is paired with wireless mobility, and network management functions can also be shared, providing network operators with reductions in both operating expenses and capital investments; BENEFIT: Military communication systems on avionic platforms have very small size and low weight requirements. Fiber optic based links provide inherent advantages over electronic based systems due to ultra-wide bandwidth, immunity to electromagnetic interference and reduced weight. Despite the advantages provided by fiber optics, the size of an entire system is still limited by engineering tradeoffs such as the spacing required between components due to the fiber optic interfaces and the packaging size of individual components. Specifically, the required use of optical fiber between the laser and modulator limits the ability to create a compact transmit system. A standard system includes a laser, modulator and a photodiode receiver. Typically there is some active and\/or passive signal processing that can be done post modulator, indicating that the laser and modulator are consecutive. Thus a small packaged integrated laser and modulator device is needed."

Develop a concept of operations and the mission requirements for each recovery category. Identify candidate recovery concepts and perform an analysis of alternatives for each recovery category. Size at least one concept in each category to develop an understanding of how the system would integrate with a candidate vehicle in each recovery category. Develop a program plan for Phase II and beyond including analysis and testing to mature technology, validate models, reduce risk, and demonstrate capability.BENEFIT:Hypersonic weapon systems will open the door to many new capabilities for the warfighter.Applications include systems ranging from small tactical hypersonic missiles and larger high speed strike weapons to responsive space access systems and penetrating hypersonic intelligence, surveillance &amp; reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft. Due to limitations in replicating hypersonic test conditions on the ground, wind tunnel data are augmented with flight tests to calibrate current computer models and provide data for developing improved physics based models used in hypersonic system design. While significant advances have been made in the last decade under Air Force and complementary DARPA, ONR and NASA efforts, a full spectrum of research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) activities is still required in a number of hypersonic disciplines to provide the full promise of these advanced capabilities.In most previous hypersonic flight programs, the flight test article was designed to be recovered after the flight test - only telemetry data was obtained - thus post flight inspections were not performed.If recovery had occurred, it could have provided valuable insights about the airframe and engine material\/structural systems performance, scramjet engine operation, subsystem condition, and instrumentation requirements\/optimal locations, as well as potentially providing advanced warning of potential system failures on subsequent flights.New methods to enable reliable and cost effective recovery and even reuse of hypersonic flight test articles would reduce risk, improve execution efficiency, and enhance vehicle design evolution. These recovery technologies would directly support DoD hypersonic technology maturation and demonstration, as well as T&amp;E of weapon systems, and space vehicles by improved validation and verification of the system under test."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Practical automated target recognition (ATR) capabilities for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery require sustainable and easily updatable target representations as well as generalizability across different SAR sensors and operating conditions.Systems &amp; Technology Research (STR), along with Wright State University, proposes to extend ATR algorithms being developed under the AFRL Compact Automatic Target Recognition and Sustainable Environment (CASE) and DARPA Target Recognition and Adaption in Contested Environments (TRACE) programs to develop a practical SAR ATR system characterized by the following attributes:(1) Rapid target model construction using coarse grain models that capture gross target shape and scattering features.(2) Encapsulation of the scattering peak extraction to produce a sensor agnostic representation of dominant target scattering structure. (3) Robust scattering peak descriptions using pyramid match hashing codes that are learned once per target. (4) Compact target classifier encoding using Fisher vectors. (5) Low computation complexity to match encoded templates against observed data. (6) Rapid updating of target database with new models using shared visual codebooks and variable fidelity model prediction.; BENEFIT: Our SAR ATR approach provides a number of benefits for SAR exploitation systems:(1) It enables streamlined specification of new targets by developing low fidelity physical models of the targets.Target models may be built manually or though automated 3D modeling techniques if multiple photographs of the new target are available.(2) Our approach enables improved ATR performance by increasing the fidelity of the target models, but is designed to work with a broad range of target fidelities.(3) The offline target classifier generation process optimizes discriminability across mission targets of interest.(4) Since our ATR approach is based on characterizing and matching scattering mechanisms of the target at different scales, a single target representation is used to support recognition across different SAR sensors, possibly operating with different data acquisition parameters.(5) Finally, our approach for online ATR processing requires low computation and storage complexity by virtue the compact target encoding techniques.While the SAR ATR capability is targeted for tactical platforms, there are a wide range of intelligence and security applications within the DoD community as well as for homeland security."

The high transmit power achieved will ensure high data rates and reliable, secure communications with Milstar and AEHF satellite constellations.This SSPA will enable reductions in size, weight, and power consumption of SatCom transmitters and is ideally suited for protected Comms-on-the-Pause (COTP) and Comms-on-the-Move (COTM) applications; this SWaP reduction can extend mission lifetimes (especially in airborne or power-limited environments), reduce fuel and transport costs, and extend mission capabilities."

        "abstract": "With current technology, up to 50 aircraft transmitting Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) can be simulated. To fulfill the needs of the Joint Scalable Tactical Emulated Network (JSTEN), the ability to simulate 1,000 aircraft is required. To achieve this goal, the NuWaves Team proposes the ADvanced Rf environment simulator for mOde 5 and IdenTification friend or foe (ADROIT) system. The ADROIT system builds on the current technology by incorporating a high linearity RF power amplifier (PA) and low-spurious RF downconverter in an improved COTS IFF simulator\/stimulator. The additional RF output power from the PA, and the reduced spurious emissions from the downconverter combine to provide greater system dynamic range, for a more realistic representation of the RF environment.The technical objective of the ADROIT effort is to design, simulate, and analyze an innovative high-efficiency and high-linearity L-band PA, and a low-spurious downconverter to increase the dynamic range of a COTS IFF simulator\/stimulator. Additionally, the integration plan for the PA and downconverter into the IFF simulator\/stimulator, identification of the upgrades to the IFF simulator\/stimulator to process up to 1,000 aircraft, and definition of the interface of the ADROIT system to the Armys JSTEN network will be completed."

New Mode 5 interrogators and transponders have been in development for the past few years and there is a need for comprehensive testing for the new systems and test support equipment prior to widespread deployment. This testing must be done at scale with a large number of multiple aircraft systems generating signals for the live interrogator\/receiver to ensure that the IFF system can operate in several high air traffic conditions. In this SBIR proposal, we present M5WTB, a simulation based testing solution that will reduce costs for scalability testing of Mode 5 receivers. In M5WTB, an existinghigh fidelity Mode 5 simulation model will be tightly coupled with encryption and software defined radio hardware for injecting secure transmissions from 1000s of simulated tactical aircrafts at the 1090Mhz radio frequency in order to realistically stimulate Mode 5 receiver hardware. In Phase 1 of the SBIR effort, the Scalable team will undertake a study to define the concepts of operations and use cases for M5WTB along with further in-depth investigation of technical approaches that will make up the overall solution."

        "abstract": "Operational Energy (OE) is the energy, associated systems, information and processes required to train, move, and sustain forces and systems for military operations (Scholtes, 2013). Efficient OE requires effective management of energy and supply resources, including energy used by tactical power systems, generators and weapons platforms. Army Secretary Jon McHugh stated that leaders and individuals at all levels must understand how energy contributes to their respective operational roles and consider it in planning decisions and daily behaviors. To address these requirements, Charles River Analytics proposes to design and demonstrate the feasibility of Energy Models of Critical Components (E-MC2), a resource monitoring, energy prediction, and decision-support tool that uses probabilistic reasoning to construct and learn models of complex, real-world systems. Under E-MC2, we will build models of energy consumption and resource usage through Figaro, a probabilistic programming language (PPL) developed by Charles River. Using E-MC2s models, Commanders in environments such as forward operating bases will receive alerts and notifications relating to possible resource consumption issues. Commanders will also use E-MC2 as an aid to best plan and manage critical quantities, subject to anticipated operating constraints and external factors."

        "abstract": "Developing a safe and effective malaria vaccine remains the hope for reducing the spread and resurgence of the disease.In recent years, vaccine research has broadened with subunit protein, and DNA vaccines due to their inherent safety, simpler storage and easier production at the expense of attenuated and inactivated organism based approaches. RTS, S\/AS01, the most advanced subunit vaccine, has undergone phase III clinical trials. However, their efficacy results are relatively low (30% to 50%). Due to the subunit protein weak immunogenicity, often necessitate advanced delivery vectors or adjuvants. Recent progress in the design of synthetic nanoparticles that can stimulate immune system opened up a new area of vaccine development, however with limited successes in malaria vaccine preventing these candidates going into clinical trials. These approaches failed to overcome the inherent drawbacks of subunit vaccines as well as failed to address the unique and complex ability to infect hosts at multistage of its life cycle with varying antigens present at the parasite particle surface. Luna proposes a novel nano enabled malaria vaccine which will induce long-lived protective immune responses by targeting multiple epitopes at each of its unique life stages through precisely engineered, staged release of antigens and\/or adjuvants."

As the number of possible laser wavelengths increases, this approach becomes less practical, because for each wavelength blocked, more and more visible light is attenuated until the system is well-blocked, but useless as a visual system.Our approach is to leverage work being done at AFRL, SA Photonics, and Debye Research in developing a solid state limiter.We have chosen two different materials approaches, which should serve to minimize risk."

The approach is based on optical-grade nanocomposites that allow for improved optical performance in compact optical assemblies while also providing nonlinear-optical (NLO) protection. The technologies we use to realize this new capability include: optical nanocomposite materials, new approaches to additive manufacturing (AM), and freeform GRIN optical engineering.NLO materials will be synthesized and their properties measured. Then, NLO lenses will be fabricated and tested. The wavefront distortion, point-spread function, modulation transfer function, transmission, haze, etc., will be tested in the laboratory, and optical-limiting-performance testing will be compared to theoretical analysis."

These methods are plasma welding, vacuum deposition, andplatinum laser deposition.Each will be evaluated for reaction speed with targeted response times in the micro-second range while surviving in harsh vibration, shock, and temperature environments.It is also proposed that these thermocouples will be interfaced to a wireless telemetry transmitter on the piston which will allow the surface temperature data to be transmitted from the piston during engine operation. This will be accomplished in a running diesel engine with surface measurements on the piston crown. Each thermocouple design will be compared simultaneously on the same piston in the engine using the same wireless transmitter.IR Telemetrics currently utilizes an RF transmitter with a minimum bandwidth of 10 kHz sampling rate.Through the project development, this transmitter will be increased to 35 kHz or more."

        "abstract": "The Navy relies on automatic test systems (ATS) such as the Consolidated Automatic Support System (CASS) to save billions of dollars in maintenance costs over fragmented testing techniques, minimize aircraft downtime, and quickly re-certify avionics components. Although they are state-of-the-art, modern automatic test systems like CASS interface only with conventional data buses and are unable to support current, high-speed digital data buses. Because the latest aircraft avionics and weapons systems are now incorporating high-speed buses such as SATA, Wi-Fi, IEEE 1394 FireWire, and USB, there is an immediate need to integrate high-speed bus testing into ATS. Technology Service Corporation (TSC) proposes to develop an ATS High-Speed Bus Tester (HSBT) by leveraging the test creation flexibility of its Crane Custom Test Bench (CCTB) while remaining platform agnostic through the use of IEEE 1671 ATML abstraction. CCTB is an automatic test system currently providing radar, electronic warfare, and communications testing for the Navys ALQ-218 Tactical Jamming Receiver at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division. Its architecture is built upon LabVIEW Object-Oriented Programming (LVOOP) and utilizes packed libraries and XML configuration files to provide flexible building blocks for test."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: TSC and KEYW propose to develop novel methods of increasing the detection sensitivity of air-to-air modes by using a single, long Coherent Processing Interval (CPI) that eliminates the need for multiple Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) waveforms. TSC will investigate three highly innovative approaches in Phase I. One approach is to coherently integrate all of the pulses from the current multiple PRF waveforms out to the maximum range of interest for enhanced radar detection performance. In other approaches, TSC will focus on tracking algorithms to resolve the inherent range ambiguities when multiple PRFs and CPIs are employed.Each of these techniques will be evaluated during the proposed Phase I effort and quantified with respect to overall target detection and tracking performance improvement, computational complexity and implementation difficulty. KEYW will provide previously collected high PRF data from their Sahara testbed on aircraft targets for algorithm development and testing. In Phase II, TSC will mature the most promising algorithm(s) and experimentally demonstrate the new High PRF techniques using a selected radar testbed. Further work includes working with a radar prime contractor to transition the algorithms into an Air Force program of record.; BENEFIT: This technology can greatly improve the detection range, angle measurement accuracy and overall tracking performance of modern fighter radars against low RCS targets in sidelobe clutter, such as for tail-chase, look-down encounters with low observable cruise missiles. This will provide fighters such as the F-15E, F-35A or future F-X 6th generation fighter with an enhanced capability to detect, track and destroy advanced low-observable threats that are currently being developed and fielded by our adversaries, and will increase the security of the US and its allies."

        "abstract": "Successful V&amp;V of complex systems relies on a representative test environment, test data, and Subject Matter Expert (SME) manpower to investigate tough cognitive issues encountered during integration. Because many systems have interface and interoperability requirements with other systems and subsystems, SIM\/STIM tools are essential for ensuring incremental combat system developments are functioning correctly. But wherever there is a lack of access to resources across test communities, SME manpower is inefficiently expended planning and significant lag in the development cycle occurs. This proposal addresses limitations by providing an Automated V&amp;V framework for Distributed Testing (ADT) which also supports the necessary SIM\/STIM to conduct testing in a variety of configurations. Our novel approach will increase SIM\/STIM capability while providing an automated tool suite that leverages a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. A detailed model of SQQ-89 and AEGIS enables efficient cross-organizational technical reviews and provides approval and acceptance for true Objective Quality Evidence (OQE) used for platform Certification. Our solution leverages proven products within IDTs Automated Test and Re-Test (ATRT) software suite. By leveraging these core technologies we can provide the necessary infrastructure needed to achieve the Navys automated V&amp;V goals for distributed testing while reducing development costs."

However, MEMS based IMUs have been known to experience performance degradation while operating through stressing shock and vibration environments.

There exists an emerging opportunity to combine printed electronics with traditional additive manufacturing to realize cost savings while increasing capability. Of special interest is the opportunity to embed RF components into additive manufacturing. We propose developing technology to embed RF components into additive manufacturing substrates.

For the Phase I program, XII will prototype a CUTIS and demonstrate the feasibility of this technique for detecting\/imaging the spatially-resolved and time-dependent multi-phase flow characteristics.

First, we will perform an analysis of the failure mechanisms to demonstrate the response of failed cells. We will be using our existing data, and will perform tests when necessary, taking into account multiple chemistries, the application profiles, the suite of targeted sensors, and the environment. This effort will result in the enhancement of our current data fusion algorithms, which will be tuned to the specific Navy application. Based on the previous efforts, our second step will be to develop a novel low cost SWaP embedded system that combines conventional sensors with a low-cost and low-power set of unique transducers capable of detecting battery faults reliably.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The US Air Force seeks an innovative nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique to assess the integrity and microstructure state of integrally bladed disk (IBD) airfoils after repairs. The IBD repair process typically involves machining away the damage portion, refilling materials using either additive type processing methods or welding a patch on it, restoring material microstructure through post heat treatment, and restore the original blade shape via machining. One big concern to the IBD repairs in the mechanical property knock-down. Therefore, a NDE technology capable of assessing the repair material microstructure and mechanical properties, as well as detecting internal and surface flaws is highly desirable. In this proposal, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) outlines an innovative Quantitative Acoustic Microscopy (called QAM) technology. Phase I program is to develop a prototype system and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed QAM technique. For the Phase II program, XII will focus on refining the prototype system design and development with improved hardware and software.For the Phase III program, XII will focus on commercializing the developed QAM technology.; BENEFIT: The proposed QAM system has many market applications in different industries such as the air and space vehicles, power generators, and advanced new material research. The total market will increase in the future because the characterization of material properties and detection of defects is essential for many important material systems. The proposed research provides a great support for improvement of the integrity and safety of repaired IBD airfoils. Such a system will benefit the enhancement of the lifetime and durability and the reduction of failure risk of the engine."

The software suites foundation lies in a one-time creation of a look-up table which represents high-fidelity missile plume computations in terms of fluid flow streamlines with superimposed physical properties such as temperature, density, and species concentrations. The result is a compact and scalable (for different system and sensor parameters) representation of the multi-dimensional simulation environment. This is coupled with novel spatial morphing, field interpolation, and radiative transfer algorithms to allow FRAMES to achieve real-time performance over a wide range of threat systems.This software suite will initially be developed to address boost phase missile signatures and later extended to mid-course.It will be developed as an integrable module for MDA high-level architectures including the Objective Simulation Framework (OSF)."

        "abstract": "The performance of early warning and missile defense optical sensors and their associated detection and tracking algorithms can be robustly evaluated using hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) testing technology.This requires high-frame rate (~400 Hz) simulated imagery of the highly dynamic threat missile system.There is a need for an engineering-level method to provide on-demand, real-time, realistic plume imagery to the HWIL scene generator.Spectral Sciences, Inc. and Kinetics, Inc. propose to extend an existing high-altitude plume flow filed morphing and real-time plume imaging system, the Fast Rendering Algorithm for Missile Emission Scenes (FRAMES) to apply to low altitude missile systems.The key idea in the FRAMES approach is that one interpolates between pre-computed flow fields, and then generates an image based on the interpolated flow field, rather than interpolating between pre-computed images. This project focuses on morphological interpolation ofthe low-altitude Enhanced Missile Signature (E-MSIG) plume flow field database, and rendering high-frame rate imagery using the GPU-based SPIDER radiative transfer code. In Phase I we will develop and demonstrate the FRAMES-EMSIG algorithms necessary to generate missile plume signatures targeting a 50 Hz frame rate for a representative threat system."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The characterization of novel thermal protection system (TPS) materials is key to the mission success of future hypersonic vehicles.Non-intrusive methods, based on spectroscopic signatures, can provide information on the state of the TPS materials and surrounding shock layer.However, the close coupling of the TPS material response with the high-temperature gas dynamics and finite-rate chemistry create a strong non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) environment that must be taken into account to properly interpret measurements.To date, no end-to-end simulation tool exists that connects the advanced material response, chemistry, gas flow, and particulates to the electro-optic infrared (EO\/IR) signature.The goal of this R&amp;D by Spectral Sciences, Inc. is to develop new simulation tools to create a material characterization testbed with EO\/IR signatures.Phase I would provide a proof of principle framework for the simulation tool, with focus on evaluating material characterization from spectroscopic measurements of emitting surfaces, NLTE gas products, and embedded micro-capsules.In Phase II, the software will be further extended and validated to enable a better understanding of advanced TPS material response.Finally, it will be used to update material thermodynamic models for a wide range of advanced TPS materials.; BENEFIT: The proposed toolset and upgraded simulation capabilities will have wide application for hypersonic flow problems, including the development of military hypersonic vehicles and their TPS materials and the modeling of reentry flows for missile defense. The software will enable characterization of advanced materials under a wide range of hypersonic conditions.Further applications could include development of design sensor concepts for intercept and tracking of current and future hypersonic and reentry weapons systems.Military applications also include analysis of intelligence data.Furthermore, work on validating and hardening the proposed toolset will aid other DoD programs that use the underlying computational fluid dynamics and radiation transport libraries.Commercial applications consist of design of reentry systems for NASA and commercial transport systems. In addition, the proposed software complements existing commercial continuum fluid dynamics software, providing gas\/flame diagnostics modeling tools for high temperature flows."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Composite materials in aircraft are susceptible to heat damage.There is an urgent need to detect and quantify heat damage at an early stage (incipient heat damage) using non-destructive methods.Handheld Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) instruments represent a promising means to detect and quantify heat damage.Spectral Sciences, Inc. together with Aurora Flight Sciences propose a systematic acquisition of FTIR spectra from composites with varying degrees of heat damage coupled with a physics-based post-processing of those spectra.The Infrared Non-destructive Spectral Procedure for Composite Testing (INSPCT) approach will relate physically and chemically meaningful interpretations of FTIR spectra to mechanical strength and heat-damage state of the material. The key enabling technologies are the application of sophisticated retrieval and spectral abundance analyses of measured FTIR spectra and physics-based interpretation techniques based in fundamental optical properties to extract spectral fingerprints of heat damage from the signal.The product will take measured FTIR spectra and return the damage state referenced to ASTM tests.; BENEFIT: The successful product will interpret spectral features of BMI composite material measured with a handheld FTIR and relate it to ASTM test-referenced local material strength.The underlying database of FTIR measurements and ASTM-referenced local strengths will also be available as a product.A software module embedded in the handheld FTIR processor will provide the inspector prompt readings of the extent if any of heat damage to the composite.The approach we take should be adaptable to any composite material system, so that the product could be applied to FTIR interrogation of the chemical state (be it heat damage, degree of cure, etc.) of any resin bearing composite.The approach uses algorithms from remote sensing, and may be conformable in the future to a standoff inspection that could survey a large area in one acquisition."

Recent studies have shown that Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) imaging polarimeters can detect these threats; however, the implementation of the polarimeters has not been traceable to a ruggedized, field ready imaging system. Guidestar Optical Systems proposes to develop an imaging LWIR polarimeter to detect disturbed earth (a signature of buried explosives) and man-made objects on the roadside. The implementation of Guidestars polarimeter will be suitable for use with dynamic scenes and a vibrating\/moving platform. We will develop a Phase I bench top prototype sensor suite (consisting of the LWIR polarimeter, a visible imaging camera, and a near IR imaging camera) and perform initial testing with this suite. The visible and NIR cameras will provide high-resolution images to enhance the detection capability of the LWIR polarimeter. The Phase I option program will expand the testing to include threat detection with cluttered scenes and backgrounds to provide a robust proof of concept demonstration as well as identify the key design features required for the Phase II field capable prototype sensor."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Guidestar Optical Systems proposes using digital holography to track an extended target in the presence of scintillation and speckle. Speckle is mitigated using an iterative metric optimization method on received images and then time averaged to remove scintillation effects. A wave-optics simulation will be performed in Phase I to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, shifting to hardware in Phase II.; BENEFIT: High energy laser systems require actively illuminated targets for fine tracking purposes.This active illumination causes speckle and scintillation artifacts, which Guidestar proposes to mitigate using digital holographic imaging.This digital holographic imaging technique allows for decreased illuminator power, which will significantly enhance the size, weight, and power of the tracking system, a critical performance metric for airborne systems.In addition to the active tracking application, high resolution imagery produced by the digital holographic imaging technique enables target identification, kill assessment, three dimensional imaging, fine detail extraction in surveillance missions, and target material composition.Industrial applications include defect detection and identification, as well as stress and failure detection and analysis.Potential commercial applications include three dimensional video recording for the next generation of three dimensional video projection systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This SBIR Phase I project proposes a hierarchical visual processing system and attention-based mechanisms based on novel 3D convolutional neural networks to enable robust and efficient detection and classification of objects in 3D LIDAR imagery. Our approach models the ventral pathway of the visual cortex and addresses many limitations of the state-of-the-art solutions that perform exhaustive search for the targets of interest and rely on pre-designed features. Instead, the proposed framework uses bottom-up and top-down attentional mechanisms to improve the efficiency of the framework and enable incorporation of prior models and available context for efficient performance. In addition, instead of using hard-coded features, the proposed approach is capable of learning hierarchical invariant 3D feature representations that are object class independent from training datasets. The Phase I effort will include; development of biologically inspired 3D deep learning framework for 3D LIDAR data, fusion-of-attention mechanisms to identify salient regions, implementation of the software as open-source library, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the proposed technologies, and demonstration of proof of concept using real-world data from multiple use-cases.; BENEFIT: Autonomous unmanned vehicles (UxVs) have proven to be critical assets for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance as well as remote sensing systems. Equipped with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) EO\/IR and LIDAR sensors, they are capable of providing high resolution 3D mapping of wide geospatial areas and generate a large amount of data. For example, new COTS LIDAR sensors are capable of producing between 20,000 to 200,000 points per second for large range systems and more than a million points per second for short-range systems. The availability of large volumes of information-rich sensor data poses unique challenges to analysts for timely data exploitation. The technologies proposed here would advance the state-of-the-art in the exploitation of LIDAR sensors and will enable robust and efficient detection and classification of objects-of-interest in 3D LIDAR imagery. The proposed technologies will also provide a natural framework for combining context information from other sensors (e.g. EO\/IR) for improved target detection and classification. The proposed technologies have wide ranging commercial and defense applications that include:Multi-sensor Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems.Autonomous surveying systems for urban planningDamage analysis tools for disaster assessment, response and recovery.The proposed technologies advance the state of the art in the DoD S&amp;T emphasis area of AutonomyThe proposed detection and classification technology will result in improved manned and un-manned sensor exploitation systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To improve the tracking and pattern analysis of high value targets (HVTs), a technique for associating and fusing large quantities of kinematic data with temporally sparse, but highly informative, target ID information is required. Specifically, there is a need to develop a data association algorithm that will connect highly informative target ID observations with kinematic tracks in order to estimate the set of likely trajectories that an HVT could have traveled between these ID observations. The primary challenges include: (1) ambiguity and gaps in tracks over extended time periods, (2) high rate and volume of kinematic data to be processed, and (3) use of multi-INT classification data with varying feature spaces, uncertainty models, and ambiguities. Lakota Technical Solutions, Inc. proposes the Boundary Value and Retrospective Correlator (BVARC) algorithm for association of multi-INT classification and kinematic data with temporally sparse ID information. This approach provides an O(N) storage size scalability for track hypotheses, O(N log(N)) computational complexity for data association, and leverages a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 technology to quantify the consistency and conflict between multi-INT classification data. The BVARC provides a tractable capability to identify and rank the set of trajectories traveled by an HVT for large-scale tracking problems.; BENEFIT: The DoD encounters many problems that require the tracking, classification, and analysis of target behavior over extended time periods far beyond the update intervals of a sensor, including: (a) high-value targets traveling in vehicles on land, (b) ballistic missile handoff between over-the-horizon (OTH) sensors, (c) maritime vessels traveling great distances with large gaps in sensor coverage, (d) submarines with intermittent detections, and (e) orbiting satellites that performing maneuvers during large gaps in sensor coverage. Each of these examples requires the ability to maintain and evaluate trajectory hypotheses over extended periods of time with feasible storage and computational requirements. Lakotas proposed BVARC is a generalized approach that can be employed in all of these domains with computational feasibility in large-scale tracking environments where large numbers of hypotheses are inevitable. As a result, BVARC has a large canvas of potential transition targets within the Air Force, other DoD, and potentially private commercial domains."

It will enable 100% data availability through, not only the collection of the ATE health and test results data via a dedicated ATE network, but the aggregation, analytics, and search capabilities of a central data repository. The increased efficiency of the depot can be realized through the integration of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) methodologies that can be built upon the new data repository. The solution will promote an effective workforce by lessening the overall demands of data collection through the reduction of the required manual data collection effort and time. Finally, increased quality part availability can be achieved in three ways. The first way is through the increased availability of the ATE itself.The second is through the accurate historical tracking of ATE operational quality and individual serialized parts being evaluated. The third way is through the use of an untapped data source contained within many of the ATEs."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: ATA will develop the Spin Stabilized Optical Inertial Reference Unit (SSOIRU) to provide an inertially stabilized optical reference beam for HEL weapon systems on tactical aircraft.Our approach is based on proven spinning mass gyroscope technology and the initial concept design suggests a 10x reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP).The SSOIRU concept is based on existing technology and could be implemented in an operational mission within a 2-3 year period.Spin stabilization is used for in many high performance components.ATAs TIRU utilized a NG G2000 DTG and this device contained the components that will be utilized by ATAs SSOIRU with the exception of the laser source and optics.However, a DTG cages the flexured spinning mass to the case and the torques applied to the mass are a measure of angular rates.The SSOIRU will allow the flexured spinning mass to remain isolated from the housing at high frequency and caged at low frequency.Actuators also apply torque to the spinning mass as needed to follow a slew.Our approach relies on a large angular momentum and minimizing or eliminating unwanted torque on the rotor versus a low passive isolator frequency and high control bandwidth.; BENEFIT: The Spin Stabilized Optical Inertial Reference Unit (SSOIRU) has many benefits.Spin stabilization is a proven technology used in mechanical (spinning mass) gyroscopes as well as many spacecraft applications.The SSOIRU approach is based on this existing technology and we believe we could implement an SSOIRU in an operational system within 2-3 years.Our low SWaP-C approach enables these devices to be used on tactical, high energy laser (HEL) weapon systems.The high angular momentum provides inertial stabilization, which eliminates the need for a high bandwidth control loop and precision inertial sensors.This approach also eliminates redundant flexure supported platforms (mechanical gyroscope contains a flexure supported spinning mass which is mounted on the OIRU stable platform).ATA has been developing technology for the U.S. Government and Aerospace contractors since 1975.During this time, we have developed outstanding relationships that we will leverage to bring the SSOIRU technology to market.ATAs success in generating additional revenue tied to our Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects has allowed ATA to grow and expand its business through Phase III commercialization and other spin-off contracts.As reported in the ATA Company Commercialization Report, we have received 58 Phase I SBIR awards and 25 Phase II awards.ATAs track record for commercialization of SBIR sponsored technology development is excellent, resulting in a Commercialization Achievement Index of 90 and related cumulative revenues from sales and additional investments of over $42 million.The global inertial sensing systems market is currently &gt;$4B annually and is expected to grow at an overall Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.2% to &gt;$7B by 2019.ATA is focused on the IMU segment of this market, of which OIRUs are a very small fraction.Potential OIRU applications include missions having stringent LOSS and IAK requirements such as airborne DEW, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and space laser communications.ATA anticipates capturing significant market share, as OIRUs are a very specialized product niche in which we own most of the Intellectual Property (IP).We continually work to enhance and improve our OIRU designs and technology to maintain our competitive edge while reaching out to competitors to supply their specific mission needs.Our goal is to be the Number One supplier of OIRUs worldwide."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: ATA proposes to develop an optical communications terminal with low SWaP-C that enables high data rate communications between GPS satellites.Our proposed Laser Communications Crosslink (LaserComXL) terminal integrates advanced ATA line-of-sight stabilization, tracking and pointing technologies with space-qualified laser and detector technologies into a compact package with multiple optical heads capable of simultaneously maintaining links to multiple other satellites in the GPS constellation.ATAs low SWaP-C GPS crosslink system combines high photon efficiency optical communications technologies with ATAs expertise in stabilization, tracking, and space optical terminals.High photon efficiency optical communications concepts have demonstrated high rate communications with small apertures and low transmitted laser power.Each LaserComXL terminal set would contain two independently operating optical heads sharing a common reference star tracker.We will mount two terminal sets on opposite sides of a satellite to support four independently addressable simultaneous links to neighboring satellites within the constellation.Each optical head would contain apertures of approximately 25 mm diameter.The terminal set weight goal is 10 pounds with a power goal of 15 watts.; BENEFIT: ATAs LaserComXL has many anticipated benefits.Our multi-link optical terminals will enable data networking of GPS constellation via a compact, low SWaP-C configuration.The persistent links allow ranging, clock synchronization and ephemeris updates while the optical channel provides flexibility and scalability for higher data rates.In addition to the GPS Crosslink application, ATA is pursuing a number of civil space and non-government applications for its LaserComXL technology.We are in discussions with major aerospace primes for laser communications optical modules.In addition, numerous commercial companies are planning constellations of earth imaging satellites and internet connectivity satellites.The major market segment for InterSat Communications Links can be divided into two market sub-segments: one where communications is the primary mission of the satellite constellation, and a second where earth imaging is primary mission of a constellation (that needs to relay large amounts of data rapidly around the globe to ground stations).The estimated total available market (TAM) for these applications exceeds $1B based on public statements by numerous commercial companies."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Electric wires and cables constitute by far the largest weight portion of aircraft electrical power systems, as well as a large fraction of the entire aircraft weight. For example, a modern transport aircraft contains over 200 miles of wire, and an F-22 aircraft has about 20 miles of wiring. The increased emphasis and reliance on fly-by-wire technology and avionics for modern aircraft has resulted in wiring becoming a critical safety-of-flight system. Aerospace vehicles continue to increase in wire system complexity and volume as traditional mechanical systems, such as flight controls and flight surface control actuators, are converted to all electric systems. DexMat is developing a technology for coating doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with impermeable barrier films. Under this Phase I project, DexMat will adapt the use of metallic barrier film coatings to prevent the egression of CNT dopants and, thus, preserve high electrical conductivity even if the fiber is subjected to high-temperature environments.; BENEFIT: The proposed primary production of DexMat technology is directed to the commercial and military aviation segments, mainly companies seeking to reduce the weight of their aircraft design. Beyond these customers, the potential uses of CNT wires and films include a broad spectrum of military and civilian applicationsfrom lightweight aerospace cables, to power and data conduits for wearable electronics, to health monitoring and diagnostic sensors."

VISTA builds on the highly promising SUAVE 3D viewing interface that we have developed under sponsorship from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and Office of Naval Research (ONR).This proven concept greatly improves surveillance and target detection in multiple geo-registered image streams (up to 13 have been successfully tested).In this proposal we adapt the existing SUAVE product to explicitly address the multi-platform sensor operators challenge, which is of major interest to government, industry, and academia. In previous work, we assumed that Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) data provided the basic 3D frame for the rendering.But in the VISTA effort we will extract 3D information directly from the video data in near real time, using results applied from a large NSF research project by consultant Prof. Simon Lucey of the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Robotics Institute.In addition, we will adopt intelligent human support aids to ensure that the operator gets maximum value from the resulting visualization."

There has been a large volume of academic research on swarms and many interesting behaviors produced in a lab environment.The goal of our proposed effort is to take the promising behavior that has been demonstrated in the lab and make it relevant and practically useful for Army customers.To accomplish this, IDEAS behavior definition will incorporate a sound and proven modeling formalism based on Petri-Net diagrams that we have successfully applied on several unmanned system programs."

        "abstract": "For many programs, it would be desirable to fail fast in the face of attack in order to preserve confidentiality and integrity. We propose a tool to statically rewrite binaries to increase their fragility, adding this fail-fast property. We will operate on binaries to maximize the number of programs we can protect. Binary rewriting can be applied to any program without cooperation from the compiler, thus supporting programs written in multiple languages or composed from components from different vendors where source may not be available.Our defenses are designed to protect against information disclosure and control flow hijacking attacks. These defenses will introduce fragility to hinder attacks both before they can inject a malicious payload as well as during active attacks. These defenses turn invalid or undefined behaviors in source programs into fail-stop conditions at run time. Nothing we propose relies on particular software or hardware platform features, and is thus suitable for embedded as well as more traditional server platforms. With prior experience in both binary analysis and verification, Galois is well-positioned to develop high-assurance semantics preserving binary transformations."

Recent research suggests, however, that the work of evaluating the security of cryptographic algorithms, and of exploring the security tradeoffs of alternative designs within a general class, can be at least partly automated. We propose to build a comprehensive cryptographic analysis, verification, exploration and synthesis tool suite that provides users a wide variety of automated capabilities that assist in developing new cryptographic algorithms. CAVES will build upon Galois existing Cryptol and SAW tools, which already allow for formal specification and verification of cryptographic implementations. The resulting tool kit will ultimately allow cryptographers to quickly describe an algorithm, automatically or semi-automatically perform a collection of cryptanalysis tasks to assess its likely level of security, and automatically enumerate various alternative designs along with assessment of their comparative security levels."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this proposal is to develop blast cleaning enclosures (BCE) that eliminate exposure to hazardous materials (HM) due to substantial migration in and around the enclosure to increase the occupational health and safety of Air Force personnel.  To achieve this cleaner safer BCE, typical operations and enclosures will be examined to identify mechanisms of HM generation and migration pathways that create or result in a hazardous or potentially hazardous exposure.  This examination will make evident commonalities between various types of blast cleaning operations and allow the application of corrective measures that will in turn control HM generation and migration to below OSHA permissible exposure limits (PEL), for both operators and personnel in close proximity to the enclosures.  The corrective methods will increase worker safety, increase production where OSHA time-weighted-average exposures rules limit operator exposure time, satisfy tightening OSHA requirements, decrease the need for personal protective equipment (PPE), reduce the likelihood of injury in the case of PPE failure, and ensure that personnel in adjacent&amp;quot;safe zones&amp;quot;are guaranteed to be safe from exposure.  BENEFIT:  The criticality of these research findings will prove particularly valuable to the DoD as the intended life of DoD systems is commonly several times longer than protective coatings&amp;quot;lives, rendering necessary the stripping and reapplication of protective coatings numerous times over the system&amp;quot;s lifespan.  Projected reduced defense spending budgets will disallow for purchasing noncritical new equipment, forcing the Services to extend system lifespans adding significantly to the current production demands for refinishing.  Further intensifying the refinishing workload is the environmental change equipment will endure, moving from hot and dry climates to wet and corrosive environments in the Pacific theater, which will certainly shorten coating lifespans.  With increased refinishing demand comes increased blast cleaning, which creates more exposure risks, which increases likelihood of costly injuries and illness proportionately.  By eliminating exposure now, the USAF and DoD is eliminating production interruptions and expensive medical bills in the future."

There are currently no methods of preventing or treating ricin exposurethis represents a major unmet need for protection of civilians and warfighters. Because of their excellent safety profile and efficacy, mAbs are a rapidly growing class of therapeutic drugs with a regulatory track record superior to small molecules.The Mapp team, in collaboration with Dr. Nicholas Mantis (Wadsworth Institute, Albany, NY) has identified a highly potent humanized anti-ricin mAb, hPB10. The potency of this mAb is superior to any mAb previously described. In this work effort we propose to increase the serum-half life of hPB10 and establish proof-of-concept in rodent models with a long range objective of developing a safe, effective and long-acting mAb (&gt; 6 months of protection from a single dose) product for ricin intoxication.The envisioned injectable product will be for use in humans both prior to (e.g. by first responders or military personnel entering a contaminated zone) and\/or after ricin exposure."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Electrolytic Hard Chrome (ECH) is the standard coating method for 4XXX steels used in actuators and depot-based repair of damaged items.  The properties of EHC coatings are excellent, and as a result EHC coatings have been used for more than 50 years.  Unfortunately, EHC plating uses hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) that is regulated by both OSHA and the EPA.  Health and environmental concerns with hexavalent chromium has led the DOD to direct the military to develop chromate substitutes in plating operations.  There are several hidden benefits of EHC coatings, including the presence of numerous existing plating facilities (both OEM and repair depots) and a large cadre of skilled plating personnel.  Thus an attractive replacement for EHC coatings on 4XXX steel  actuators would be an alternative plating approach that provides a hard coating that is ductile, lubricious and corrosion resistant and that gives the same or better performance than EHC, and can be applied with existing facilities and by personnel, but which does not involve the use of toxic plating solutions.  The Phase I effort will evaluate electroplated ternary alloy compositions that have the desired properties and can be plated from aqueous baths using low-toxicity electroactive metal salts.  BENEFIT:  The proposed work will identify a high performance electrodeposited alloy that can replace EHC coatings.  The new material will have better performance than EHC coatings thereby leading to longer lifecycles and lower costs, and the mew electrodeposited alloys will be plated from non-toxic plating baths that will support the move from hexavalent chromates to greener materials."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Stainless steel ballscrew components, such as those found in landing gear and flap actuators on the C-130 aircraft, experience wear and subsequent failure due to corrosion, contamination and foreign object damage (FOD).  High&amp;quot;dither&amp;quot;conditions, where the actuator undergoes a constant short-travel, high-frequency movement to maintain level flight, can also induce wear on actuator ballscrew and bearing components.  The Air Force, as well as the commercial airline industry, incurs a high maintenance burden associated with frequent inspections and applications of lubricants in the field in an effort to keep actuators functioning at a high availability rate.    In order to provide improved wear and damage tolerance of stainless steel and steel ball screws\/jack screws for aircraft subsystems, IBC Materials and Technologies Inc. will develop a novel dual-layer surface treatment that combines surface hardening with a Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) coating.  This dual-layer surface treatment will significantly increase the surface hardness as well as the lubricity of the steel actuator substrate, while maintaining high fatigue performance.  Increasing the component hardness to levels higher than that of contaminants, and improving lubricity at\/below levels of film lubricants, will help reduce maintenance and extend the lives of the actuators.  BENEFIT:  IBC&amp;quot;s advanced dual-layer Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) surface treatments will solve the current maintenance and wear issues caused by environmental contamination and corrosion of aircraft actuators.   The increase in both surface hardness and lubricity of the steel actuator substrate will enable dry-running, maintenance free operation of the ballscrew actuators, significantly reducing inspection\/maintenance and extending the wear lives of the actuators.  IBC will apply the dual-layer DLC system using a single industrial processing furnace, which will minimize process time and overall processing cost."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To meet the Air Forces need for a high-efficiency liquid desiccant system that simultaneously removes moisture and chloride from the ambient air, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Moisture and Chloride Scrubber (MaCS), consisting of a proprietary novel liquid desiccant, waterfall dehumidifier, reservoir, circulation pump, air blower, regenerator, controller, moisture sensor, and chloride sensor. The pump circulates the desiccant between the dehumidifier and regenerator for continuous scrubbing and regeneration. The proprietary desiccant scrubs moisture and chloride simultaneously as it flows down the dehumidifier. Regenerating the desiccant to provide continuous scrubbing allows the relative humidity to be&amp;lt;50%. POCs MaCS can be packaged in various configurations, ranging from a modular version for scrubbing aircraft on a flightline to a facility, such as a depot or hanger. In Phase I, POC will develop a conceptual MaCS system design and the optimum chloride sensor to measure atmospheric chloride concentrations in near-real time. We will fabricate the MaCS prototype and provide parametric testing to demonstrate the technologys feasibility and to quantify its potential benefits. In Phase II, we will develop a full-scale mature prototype for use on C-130 aircraft, support equipment, war-readiness material, and in buildings and storage units.  BENEFIT:  POCs MaCS is not only applicable to Air Force aircraft, but also equally applicable to the aircraft and ships for other military branches, such as the Navy and Coast Guard. The U.S. Navys aircraft and ships of all sizes are constantly operating in humid and salty environments. Implementing MaCS technology to Navy platforms will result in significant cost savings associated with corrosion related maintenance and mitigation. Other government programs that will certainly benefit from MaCS technology include federal facilities along the coasts because coastal humidity and salty environments accelerate infrastructure degradation, especially electronic and metal components. Commercial aircraft and ships face some of the similar operating environments as the military aircraft and ships. Thus humidity and chloride induced corrosion is also a never-ending maintenance challenge, which can be mitigated by MaCS."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As stated in the solicitation, the Air Force spends $4.5 billion annually on aircraft maintenance related to corrosion.  A significant fraction of this expenditure could be saved by a Corrosion Mitigation System (CMS) that both limited a shelter&amp;#039;s indoor relative humidity to less than 50% while capturing airborne chloride particles. However, these functions, particularly humidity control, can be expensive to implement with conventional dehumidifiers.      Liquid desiccant dehumidifiers are uniquely suited to efficiently control indoor humidity.    Since a liquid desiccant can dehumidify air without over-cooling the air, the high latent loads of an active aircraft shelter in a humid locale can be met without excessive (and wasteful) sensible cooling. Furthermore, a liquid-desiccant CMS has the potential to capture airborne chloride particles as it absorbs moisture.    Recent advances can significantly reduce the energy use and improve the O &amp;amp; M characteristics of a liquid-desiccant CMS.  The proposed work will study (1) liquid desiccant conditioners that use membranes to prevent droplet carryover, (2) two-stage regenerators that can almost halve the thermal energy required by the CMS, and (3) non- corrosive alternatives to the traditional lithium chloride.  The major deliverable for the proposed work is a recommended configuration for a liquid-desiccant CMS that could be field tested in a second phase of work.     BENEFIT:  If successful, the Corrosion Mitigation System (CMS) developed in the proposed work will provide the Air Force an effective means to significantly reduce maintenance costs for aircraft. The liquid desiccant technology that is the focus of this work can also be used for humidity control in standard HVAC applications.  This close sharing of technology will lead to advances crossing over in both directions between the CMS and HVAC fields."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes to develop a Liquid Desiccant (LD) based Air Washer (AW) by utilizing Vortical-flow, Direct-contact Mass Exchanger (VDMX) technology recently developed by ACT.  This system is based on principles similar to conventional Liquid Desiccant Air Conditioning systems (LDAC), such as falling film or porous wheel, but with the added capability of removing corrosion-causing chlorides from incoming salty air.  Furthermore, the proposed VDMX design offers an additional benefit over conventional LD systems:  significantly higher throughput for a specific device volume.  For instance, unlike falling film LD systems, this device has been shown to handle high air velocity with zero entrainment of droplets.  This advantage allows for the VDMX to process considerably more air flow than a traditional LD system of equivalent volume.  The result is the potential for a smaller, lighter, and less expensive LD system that, in addition to dehumidification, is also capable of particle filtration.  BENEFIT:  If the Phase II program is successful, ACT will have designed, fabricated, and demonstrated an effective dehumidification and chloride filtration system for military aircraft hangers.  This approach could also be applied to other facilities at coastal locations where corrosion is a concern, including commercial aircraft hangers, manufacturing facilities, storage facilities, and data centers.  At the end of the Phase I program, ACT will investigate these markets and identify a commercial partner for collaboration in Phase II."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force&amp;quot;s Air Logistics Centers (ALCs) are charged to maintain the fleet at maximum readiness. In order to achieve this goal, the ALCs perform aircraft scheduled maintenance using well-defined planning and scheduling processes and procedures by assigning MRO tasks to minimize the time an aircraft spends at the depot and the associated maintenance costs. However, the current system does not allow for dynamic schedule re-planning that allows users to react to anomalous events or unscheduled maintenance requirements. Robbins-Gioia proposes to solve this problem by using advanced genetic algorithms to efficiently solve static and dynamic, large scale scheduling problems. With this innovative scheduling approach, we will improve that responsive and optimality of aircraft maintenance schedules to meet both preemptive and nonpreemptive maintenance requirements.  BENEFIT:  Initial market analysis shows that a general Maintenance Management System that addresses complicated scheduling and planning requirements can have applicability across the federal, state, and private business sectors. Any type of transportation maintenance facility or complex manufacturing facility that requires resource scheduling and re-planning may be applicable commercial markets for the technology sponsored by this SBIR research. Candidates include airlines, commercial aircraft and engine manufacturers, ship builders and dry dock maintainers, passenger and industrial rail transport, bus lines, and rental car companies."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ARRVUE solution addresses the identified need for a novel approach to re-planning and re-scheduling when unanticipated work requirements (e.g., corrosion, stress failure, etc.) are identified during initial aircraft inspection at an Air Force Air Logistics Complex.  Aircraft RAMP Reallocation and Visualization with Unanticipated Events (ARRVUE) is a genetic algorithm solution to a complex integer programming problem that can generate optimized solutions for Repair Bay allocation.  It provides planners with the ability to consider standard maintenance process flows with now modified specific work plans.  Repair bay allocation is achieved using actual data from ALC systems under real-world constraints such as physical spots on the RAMP, manpower by skill type, and estimated days in work (DIW) to optimize allocation.   The Phase I plan will deliver new functionality for dynamic re-planning that builds upon existing infrastructure for necessary data access, adequate computing, and visualization of the solution and solution test and evaluation for the ALC customer.  TDKC will extend the successful Aircraft RAMP Visualization and Simulation System (ARViSS) prototype and complete RAMP simulation as a starting point for the ARRVUE development.  The resulting environment provides RAMP planners with a graphical process editor and simulation for re-planning and evaluation of work plan changes.    BENEFIT:  ARRVUE solves the topic&amp;quot;s dynamic RAMP operations re-planning problem with innovative algorithms and optimization.  Commercial applications are more and more reliant upon static planning systems, and are often ignorant of that dependency.  From an economic perspective, failure to dynamically re-plan work under way (i.e., power generator scheduled maintenance for critical infrastructure) could be catastrophic.  Additionally, we believe that the dynamic re-planning with constraints capability provided by ARRVUE could have numerous applications in other domains."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The floor of an ALC is like a well-orchestrated dance. However, when an unexpected failure occurs, it can introduce significant delays in not only the specific aircraft&amp;quot;s maintenance, but of the entire network of systems. 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSi) is in the position to answer this challenge with a concept called Reactive Aircraft Maintenance System via Evolutionary Scheduling (RAMSES). This project&amp;quot;s namesake was known for his organizing ability and capacity to move large projects along. Just as Ramses utilized the best technology of his day, RAMSES uses powerful algorithms to optimize the maintenance network in the face of unforeseen failures. The base optimization engine is an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), which provides the ability to operate under the uncertainty an unforeseen failure creates through the use of Subjective Logic. This enables the algorithm to optimally select a maintenance plan that deals directly with the materials, personnel, and facility, yet allow the algorithm to handle the uncertainty of the availability of each. The result is a shop floor capable of effectively handling any unforeseen event. And, with 21CSi&amp;quot;s sustained superlative commercialization index, we are the right company at the right time to improve ALC operations.  BENEFIT:  The RAMSES concept will have direct benefit to both the military aircraft depot as well as commercial aircraft depots. RAMSES provides a method to optimally reschedule the entire depot if an unforeseen event occurs that may cause major disruptions in the work flow. Behind the scenes, RAMSES is able to interlink all the components and activities at the depot using an evidential reasoning technology, the Evidential Reasoning Network (ERN). ERN technology allows us to describe the effects an unforeseen event would have on the components of the depot in terms of added or reduced delay. By incorporating uncertainty directly into the calculations, we are able to form conditional bounds on the effect. The EA then solves the optimization problem using these bounds. Therefore, when an unexpected event occurs, RAMSES sends out the rescheduling plan directly to the same system that the technicians are currently using. RAMSES will even develop contingency plans in the case of compound or cascading events. As far as the technician is concerned, the result is simply a change in the schedule. However, the depot supervisor, overseeing the entire operation, will notice how RAMSES maneuvers the depot floor to account for the unexpected event whilst maintaining the highest throughput possible given the anomaly. We also see this technology expanding beyond aircraft. Almost all fleet type operations have some form of maintenance shop. Land, sea, and air all require their vehicles to be periodically serviced to maintain the performance necessary for operational success. RAMSES is able to optimize scheduling from the smallest to the largest operations. The innovative ERN method to describe the relationships of the components and vehicles in the shop can be scaled for any size operation. The result is an integrated tool that saves time in a situation that usually only costs time and resources."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Concerto is Realization&amp;quot;s Commercial Off the Shelf software currently used on aircraft maintenance at all three Air Logistics Complex&amp;quot;s (ALC) as well as the software maintenance at WR-ALC.  We intend to demonstrate that Concerto has the ability to dynamically re-plan depot level maintenance and provide a detailed software demonstration with a simulation of a depot maintenance activity and the dynamic re-planning capabilities of Concerto.      Concerto has three TOC\/CCPM based algorithms that form the core of the software. They are the Concerto Critical Chain Buffering algorithm which allows users to create aggressive project plans with strategically placed time buffers, the Concerto Pipelining algorithm which allows users to control the release of projects into execution based on capacity constraints or work-in-process levels, and the Concerto Buffer Management algorithm which computes the impact of delays on buffers providing synchronized priorities for all resources and early warning signals to all managers.    We will demonstrate how Concerto schedules, controls, and optimizes depot maintenance activities and then re-plans activities in the event of unscheduled maintenance actions.    Concerto is currently used by over 200 customers, mostly commercial entities.  In our demonstration we will discuss the benefits that our commercial customers have achieved from this product.  BENEFIT:  If this project is successful it is possible for the Air Force Material Command, Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) to standardize maintenance planning, scheduling, and execution using CCPM methodology and Concerto software across the Command.  The significance of this project is that it will provide proof that Concerto is a tool that can be used to dynamically re-plan maintenance schedules giving senior managers at the ALCs a tool to make decisions regarding resource allocations and impact of schedule changes.  The impact of schedule changes can be further relayed to the most senior level decision makers and Combatant Commanders on the impact across the Air Force enterprise in the event of significant changes to aircraft, engine, and component maintenance.  In addition, to depot level maintenance, Concerto and CCPM methodology can be utilized in aircraft and equipment field level maintenance.  Concerto and CCPM methodology can be easily exported to these types of maintenance activities and can thus institutionalize maintenance management using the Concerto tool and CCPM methodology across the entire USAF.  In doing so, maintenance managers will have the same ability to plan maintenance, execute the maintenance schedule, and re-plan schedules when maintenance issues occur using the same tool and methodology at both the field and depot levels.  Maintenance managers can more easily transfer from a field level position to a depot level position since maintenance management will utilize the same tool and methodology.    Concerto is currently used by over 200 customers, mostly commercial entities.  This project could increase the visability of Concerto and CCPM methodology thus increasing the number of companies utilizing Concerto, CCPM, and the ability to re-plan projects faster."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address Air Force needs for a networked sensor system for detecting aircraft leaks and environmental contaminants that cause corrosion, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a micro-miniature, flexible integrated optical chip (FlexOChip) sensor for aircraft leak detection. This proposed sensor could be cemented to the aircraft to detect chemical leaks from fluid lines and tank surfaces without affecting its performance characteristics. These sensors are suitable for hard to reach or remotely located points around the body of the aircraft. FlexOChip comprises an array of D-shaped fiber optic sensors with half-polished fiber cores integrated on a flexible substrate. The sensor consists of edge-mounted vertical cavity surface-emitting laser chips and ultra-thin photodiodes integrated with the chip. The innovation in flexible optical chip sensing will enable precise monitoring of leaks and inform about possible subsystem failures. POC&amp;quot;s FlexOChip sensor network will be a novel, low-cost solution with high detection sensitivity and specificity, which is highly desirable for routine aircraft maintenance. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of detection of hydraulic fluids, aircraft fuel, humidity, and oxidizers. In Phase II, POC plans to build a prototype of FlexOChip sensor modules wirelessly integrated with a central command station.  BENEFIT:  The FlexOChip sensor technology will enable the Air Force to enhance its existing aircraft maintenance capability. The proposed micro-miniature, flexible integrated optical chip sensor can be used to automatically collect, store, and manage, and be intelligently exploited, for monitoring the structural health status of the aircraft. The sensor system can take advantage of new computing and software technologies for leak detection at hard to access places around the body of the aircraft. Once the project is successful and carried over into Phases II and III, the resulting product will be highly marketable. FlexOChip sensors could be used in a wide range of applications, from monitoring of leaks in cargo planes and commercial aircraft to monitoring power plants, oil rigs, chemical plants, vehicle engines, and pipe lines."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Aircraft damage resulting from environmental exposure and fluid leaks constitute a major portion of the costs associated with aircraft repairs and lead to significantly reduced mission readiness.  The ability to identify contaminant exposure within airframes and inform maintenance personnel of leaks, corrosive environments, and chemical contaminants in difficult to access areas will allow for enhanced condition based maintenance, reducing costs and increasing aircraft availability.  In order to provide the Air Force with increased visibility into airframe contamination, Luna proposes to develop a wireless network of intelligent sensors for real time characterization of environmental exposure coupled with next generation aircraft maintenance tracking tools for an end-to-end solution.  The system will provide meaningful information to the aircraft maintenance crew by combining Luna&amp;quot;s flight tested sensor suite to measure and identify contaminants that can lead to corrosion damage with the ICARR-3D point of maintenance corrosion management tool pioneered by our development partner Mercer Engineering Research Center.  The Phase I effort will focus on developing a reliable wireless sensor system integrated with advanced off-aircraft maintenance tools.  A technology integration plan will be developed and the Phase I effort will conclude with a comprehensive demonstration of the real time leak detection system.  BENEFIT:  Corrosion and contaminant related damage costs the military and commercial aircraft operators billions of dollars each year in associated inspection and maintenance.  The system developed under this effort will allow maintainers to locate contamination issues within an airframe in a timely manner and focus their efforts on correcting these conditions, rather than identifying leaks and subsequent damage at scheduled inspection intervals.  By identifying contamination when it occurs, labor and costs to remediate the contamination and effect repairs will be reduced and aircraft availability will increase.  Furthermore, a system that identifies the level, location, and type of contamination will allow maintainers to identify faults associated with leaks, broken seals, and other component failures that degrade aircraft safety and performance.  The benefits gained by both military and commercial aircraft operators will allow for increased asset availability and reliability with minimal upfront installation investments."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Phase I SBIR program seeks a novel process to produce the new hybrid ultra-high temperature (UHTC) ceramic composites that can survive the hypersonic flights. The new process will produce a very unique grain and graded microstructure that can offer high strength (&amp;gt;100 kpsi), high fracture toughness (&amp;gt;10 MPam), and high thermal shock resistance, and high oxidation resistance over 2000oC. Thus, the new hybrid composites can serve as leading edges for hypersonic applications. Spark plasma sintering or hot-pressing will be used as a means for densification during the Phase I feasibility study. In the Phase II work, a near-net shape, hybrid composite process will be explored for sharp leading edges.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of the Phase I program will provide the foundation needed to produce oxidation and thermal shock resistant UHTCs.  Examples of primary applications are leading edges for hypersonic flights, as well as solid rocket motors (SRM) for various DoD applications including all rocket nozzles, and other ground-based missile interceptors."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In previous work for MDA and the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Ultramet demonstrated the fabrication of carbon fiber-reinforced refractory carbide matrix composites for missile and railgun projectile nosetip and aeroshell applications using a rapid, low-cost melt infiltration process. The composite materials have undergone extensive high temperature testing under laser and arcjet heating conditions and have exhibited low or no erosion when tested to nearly 2900\u00b0C. The composites have also exhibited extremely high toughness and thermal shock resistance and have good potential for operation in adverse weather. Stability in rain, snow, and hail is a critical issue for hypersonic vehicles, and Ultramet composite materials have performed very well in hydrometeor and nylon bead impact tests conducted by NASA MSFC. Coatings and conventional ceramic matrix composites (CMC) are much more prone to impact damage, whereas Ultramet CMCs have established resistance to oxidation, weather erosion, and thermal shock. In this project, Ultramet will team with aerospace systems developer and manufacturer Raytheon (component selection, requirements definition) and with Materials Research and Design (component design and analysis) to establish the feasibility of utilizing well-established melt infiltration processing of ultrahigh temperature CMC materials that offer reduced weight and increased performance as well as improved manufacturability over silicon- or boron-containing CMCs for hypersonic vehicle leading edges. Initial CMC designs will be established for the selected component(s) and a prototype will be fabricated and subjected to high temperature oxidation testing at the Air Force LHMEL facility.  BENEFIT:  The proposed use of rapidly manufactured high temperature ceramic matrix composite leading edge components can play a key role in achieving hypersonic vehicle manufacturability and cost goals as well as weight and performance objectives. Readily available materials that require little development time are critical. In addition to monolithic CMC structures such as nosetips and fins, the potential exists to combine the CMC with Ultramet&amp;quot;s structural foam insulation to produce integrated airframe\/thermal protection system aeroshell structures. Ultramet CMCs, produced by a rapid, low-cost melt infiltration process, have demonstrated outstanding performance in multiple test series, including those performed under the Composites and Advanced Materials (CAM) and Hypersonic Flight Demonstration (HyFly) programs among others. Other potential aerospace applications include launch vehicle propulsion systems and aerobraking structures for planetary exploration. Potential commercial applications include high temperature, low-mass insulating structures for heat cycle and gas turbine engines, scramjet and ramjet engine components, and furnace heat recovery units (recuperators)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Si photonic devices based on GeSn materials will be very important for the MWIR. The Air Force recognizes the need for next-generation high-performance photonic materials in the SWIR to MWIR infrared spectrum, due in part to the atmospheric high transmissive windows in this wavelength ranges.  Due to materials limitations, silicon based photonic devices have not been utilized in this wavelength region.  The development of cost effective large area SWIR-MWIR focal plane arrays would be very important for Department of Defense applications for night time surveillance, missile acquisition and tracking, and imaging through the atmosphere.  Also there is strong interest in this technology for applications of airborne imagery for detecting gaseous effluents in the atmosphere.  Molecular gases have exhibit unique spectral signatures in the IR allowing for detection and identification. Many absorption lines of gas molecules lie in this IR spectral region such as the distribution of different gases for explosives and bio-agent detection.  Mid-IR lasers for enhancing performance of directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM), which can defeat missile IR seekers with laser-jamming wavelength-blocking countermeasures.   Silicon based emitters and detectors will allow for the development of lower cost, large area photonic devices required for these applications.  BENEFIT:  Mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength lasers and detectors can be used for molecular spectroscopy and telecommunications, and have many applications including both civilian and military due to the high transparency atmospheric windows (chemical detection, LIDAR, infrared countermeasures, secure communications).  Si lasers and detectors for the computer applications, inter-chip and intra-chip communications are important as problems of routing which keep silicon circuits two dimensional could be avoided and ultra dense chips using 3-D architectures where light transmits data throughout the chip could be achieved.  Medical applications related to the high absorption in tissues at these wavelengths, and the flexible delivery by fiber optics would be important for medical diagnostics. Environmental monitoring of green house gases is increasingly important. Measuring atmospheric gas concentrations and the high sensitivity detection of these gases in the mid-IR allows for more portable and sensitive spectroscopic detection equipment.  Sensors could be built to protect miners, to monitor industrial processes gas sensing include pollution monitoring of factory and automobile emissions.  Astronomical commercial applications include analyzing meteorites, galaxy mid-IR emissions, etc. Large focal plane development results in greater telescopic throughput, and can dramatically multiply the data output for astronomical observation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this Phase I SBIR project, the Athena Group, Inc., will develop a mathematical framework and expert system design tool for robust and highly efficient filter design. The developed tool will be capable of designing filters that have challenging requirements, such as sharp transitions, narrow subbands, and\/or complicated passband structures. The developed expert system will be able to accept both mathematical constraints and physical constraints that relate to the filter&amp;quot;s resource utilization, such as data precision and power, in order to produce a near-optimal result. The developed expert system is intended to be operated without the guidance of an expert human designer, yet produce results comparable to those produced by the expert designer. By eliminating the need for human intervention, the developed expert system may be implemented in embedded applications that require real-time filter design in order to adapt to a variety of operating conditions.  BENEFIT:  The proposed technology will provide filter designers the co-design tool needed to optimally realize complex digital filters while concurrently meeting stringent design constraints. Delivered as an integrated software system that can target ASICs, FPGAs, or DSP microprocessors, the technology can significantly impact the entire DSP community."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Numericus Group, LLC (TNG) is proposing a paradigm shift for digital  filter design, opening a number of technological opportunities  that TNG is uniquely qualified to pursue. At the heart of this new  paradigm are algorithms that are guaranteed to converge and do not  require an expert to oversee their operation, unlike many existing  algorithms commonly used today. The new approach allows us  to automatically design robust, highly efficient filters that achieve  any target specifications within a user-supplied accuracy.     The new algorithms will lead to new types of electronic devices that  autonomously correct for temporal and spatial variations in their  operating environment inherent, for example, in all communication  channels. Importantly, it becomes practical to compensate for  manufacturing variations of electronic devices significantly improving  their performance. Moreover, these new algorithms are critical for&amp;quot;hard&amp;quot;design problems, e.g. phase compensation filters. Rapid and reliable  automatic design of these filters has widespread application since  any analog hardware introduces frequency dependent phase perturbations  that now can be efficiently corrected.    TNG will pursue commercial products based both on software and hardware   implementations of the new algorithms and anticipates a customer base spread   across a variety of fields.  BENEFIT:  Results of Phase I of this project will lay the foundation for  developing commercial products in Phase II that incorporate our new  filter design algorithms. For Phase II, TNG has already identified a  potential partner and will develop both software and hardware  implementations for reliable automatic design of near-optimal  filters. Since this method overcomes limitations of current filter  design technology, it opens up a number of opportunities across many  areas of interest to the Air Force."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Continuous supply of oxygen to the tissue is essential for wound healing and resistance to infection. Oxygen provides the additional energy source for the repairing process. In the early stage of wound repair, fibroblasts start to migrate, divide, and produce collagen. To promote fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, oxygen must be present in sufficient quantities. Angiogenesis in wounds is also affected by the oxygen level. Polymorphonuclear cells are one of the first lines of defense against bacteria in wound sites and produce superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and other products via the respiratory burst to kill bacteria, and their function is directly dependent on oxygen tensions. Therefore, knowing tissue oxygenation accurately can improve wound healing and surgical outcome. Triton Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a transparent wound dressing and a monitoring device that provide real-time maps of tissue oxygenation. The proposed technology is non-invasive, repeatable, and simple to use and enables continuous long-term measurements.  BENEFIT:  The proposed wound dressing and monitoring device would improve the understanding of the role of oxygen in wound healing. Moreover, it can also be used to assess the wound oxygenation in response to different treatments, which can lead to better therapeutic regimens and better patient managements"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Phase 1 research will validate an approach for material synthesis that combines mechanical alloying with explosive powder consolidation to produce bulk materials with novel properties. The main advantage to the approach is that it can be applied to diverse material systems, including the creation of alloys with otherwise insoluble constituents.  An additional advantage is that it has a straightforward path for scale up to industrial levels of production.  In Phase 1, elemental powders of bismuth, antimony and tellurium will be mechanically alloyed, both with and without inert nanoinclusions, to produce a powder with particles that are in a highly non-equilibrium state.  Explosive powder consolidation will allow the imposition of dynamic pressures in excess of 10 GPa to accomplish densification and interparticle bonding without the attendant grain growth and loss of non-equilibrium features that occur with other powder metallurgy approaches.  A series of post-consolidation heat treatments for the step restoration of the material to the equilibrium state allows a characterization of bulk properties as a function of departure from equilibrium.  The specific application addressed in Phase 1 is the development of high performance p-type thermoelectric material, a choice that not only has immediate market potential but that also allows microstructural assessment through measurements of bulk quantities such as thermopower, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity.  BENEFIT:  Non-equilibrium materials produced by shockwave synthesis may exhibit unique properties such as increased ductility, higher strength and higher melting point.  A specific application that will benefit is in the production of thermoelectric materials where the high incidence of grain boundaries and lattice defects will reduce thermal conductivity and increase the figure-of-merit, Z.  A higher Z thermoelectric material has an immediate home in generation and Peltier heat pumping applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force regularly uses eddy current and ultrasonic NDI equipment which can be configured with a wide range of battery chemistries. Many of these battery chemistries, which include toxic heavy metals, are detrimental to the environment and can be difficult and costly to dispose of. The Air Force is seeking a new power supply for applicable NDI equipment that reduces the environmental and budgetary impact from their battery use and disposal.  Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) represent the next generation of portable power supplies for use in a wide range of portable long run time applications. The use of a high specific energy liquid fuel (methanol) enables longer run times while occupying less weight and volume than competing battery technologies. In addition, DMFCs are environmentally friendly considering their fuel can be made from renewable resources, are easily recycled and have an exhaust similar to a human&amp;quot;s exhalation. Mainstream Engineering proposes the development of a DMFC brassboard to demonstrate the benefits of DMFCs as an excellent alternative power supply for use with applicable NDI equipment reducing overall environmental impact while improving utilization and usability of the NDI test equipment.  BENEFIT:  The proposed innovative Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) system has numerous benefits. The DMFC will be a significant money saver by reducing environmental and logistics costs to the Department of Defense. In addition, the DMFC is a highly flexible power source and can easily be scaled to meet the power demands from various applications. Mainstream Engineering anticipates a significant demand for this technology in the personal electronics charging market, remote recreational-use power source market, and backup power market. Any device that requires up to 1000W of electrical power would be an excellent candidate for DMFCs."

Successful development and deployment of this technology will enable on condition replacement of critical components, increasing safety and reducing cost. This product can also be part of an integrated logistics support plan. This will be developed with General Dynamics, the OEM to insure all the relevant requirements are met and executed in the development plan.  BENEFIT:   High resolution of surface and internal flaws: The Prime Photonics system will be capable of characterizing flaw sizes within 0.002&amp;quot;in both length and depth. State of the art arrayed eddy current systems are capable of detecting these resolutions, but only for surface flaws.   Eliminates human error: Since the process is automated, scans are consistent from one run to another. Ultrasonic methods rely heavily on data interpretation, as do hand held eddy current probes.    Deployable for In-Situ inspections: The arrayed magnetometer is very small, and does not require a sterile lab environment to operate in. Arrayed eddy current systems require they be set up in lab environments, as do ultrasonic, magnetic particle detection, and dye penetrant inspections.   Reduced inspection time\/Can be deployed on existing support equipment: The Prime Photonics system can be packaged to operate on existing laser bore mapping support equipment."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Gun barrels have a variety of failure modes that must be monitored over the life of a barrel. Fatigue cracking is one of the most critical failure modes and can result in catastrophic barrel rupture if not detected and addressed. Currently, there is no existing NDI method or equipment to assess fatigue cracking within the barrel wall. Luna&amp;quot;s proposed technique has the advantage of automated inspection using compact and portable hardware that can deployed on a flight line without need to remove barrels from the aircraft. Present eddy current inspection techniques rely on highly trained personnel to visually inspect and interpret test data, with human error serving as the primary drawback in using eddy currents to inspect the health of tubes. The automation of eddy current analysis and flaw sizing is very important in this research effort. Luna&amp;quot;s proposed technique makes use of artificial intelligence to classify the eddy current signals and to recognize disruptive variables such as variation in microstructure (magnetic permeability, electrical conductivity), lift-off and edge effects, as well as the rifling signature itself.  The system will be designed to account for these variables and differentiate fatigue crack characteristics (fault length and depth) from false readings.  BENEFIT:  Luna&amp;quot;s goal for this project is to develop a portable inspection device that is suitable to inspect gun barrels on a flight line without need to remove them from the aircraft. The proposed work plan is focused on detecting cracks that grow radially outward into the barrel wall, providing an assessment of fault location, length, and depth. This technique is important to the military community, but is applicable to many other industries as well. For example, pipelines, pressure vessels, and steam generator tubes for power plants all contain critical modes of cracking such as fatigue cracking, fretting corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, or intergranular attacking on the outer surfaces of tubes. As design and analysis techniques evolve to incorporate fatigue crack detection, it is important to have measurement techniques capable of providing supporting data. The proposed technology expands the assessment of fatigue cracking capability to support these important challenges."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Cold working has been used for holes in aircraft structure to extend fatigue life for decades. This procedure can be used as a terminating action or as an inspection interval extension. To have confidence in the process, the Air Force needs an inspection tool that can conclusively determine of the cold work process has been applied to a hole, and if the results are within process specifications. TRI\/Austin has already developed a prototype tool, the FastenerCam, that performs this inspection on straight shank holes, using a contact fixture. In this effort, we will enhance the FastenerCam by making it non contact, and by developing the analysis software to assess countersunk holes.  BENEFIT:  The Air Force currently allows only a conservative approximation of the benefit of cold working fastener holes. The FastenerCam ensures that holes have been properly cold worked, allowing extension of inspection intervals, and often elimination of inspections for the life of structure. A review of the A-10 shows that 25% of the 120 inspection locations specified in Durability and Damage Tolerance Analysis involve cold worked holes. Eliminating only one inspection cycle for each of these locations would result in lower cost and increased availability, and this can be applied across all Air Force fleets."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Resodyn Corporation proposes to develop a portable, cost effective, near-surface residual stress measuring tools based on electromagnetic principles.  Resodyn Corporation has patented technology developed for validating cold expanded button head rivet holes.The first application in Phase I is to apply this technology to countersunk cold expanded rivet holes in 7075 aluminum.  In Phase II, probes will be developed for all of the common hole sizes of interest to the Air Force, and additional evaluation algorithms will be developed for other alloys such as 2024 aluminum and titanium.  At the end of Phase II, field tools will be available for evaluation at Tinker AFB.  The proposed work will include custom sensors, proprietary detection circuitry (patent pending), residual stress, strain and cold work studies, and correlating algorithms.  Extending the technology to other surface stress processes such as peening on fan and compressor blades is also proposed for Phase II.  BENEFIT:  An operational need exists for a non-destructive method that can quantify the effectiveness of the cold expanded hole process.  When the correct amount of residual stress is induced around a cold expanded rivet hole, fatigue life is enhanced up to 20,000 hours.  However, because there is no method to guarantee, 100%, that the correct amount of residual compressive stress was created, the process cannot be given credit in design calculations.  It is presently done to provide un-credited safety margin.  The proposed validation device for cold expanded holes will provide 100% inspection and thus enable the design credit."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As financial constraints become more pronounced for the DOD, and industry in general, the need for efficiency and elimination of waste becomes ever more important. Factories and repair depots expend tremendous amounts of resources applying high technology coatings to improve the performance of components and systems.  The materials and application processes used for these coatings have been developed around&amp;quot;generic&amp;quot;specifications to enable applicability to many, if not all, industries at the lowest possible cost.  The DOD and OEM coating requirements are quite stringent and the generic industry specifications do not adequately define materials that ensure high coating application success and consequently result in unnecessary cost and wasted resources.  ES3 proposes to address the coating application unnecessary cost and wasted resources by creating a new set of material and process specifications that will be developed around the Air Force repair depot specific coating requirements and specific application equipment. The new set of material specifications will be designed to minimize procurement costs but yet maximize control of the feed stock materials manufacturing parameters.   This Phase I effort will prepare for Phase II activities that will focus on design, qualification and implementation planning efforts.    BENEFIT:  ES3 anticipates the results of Phase I work will validate the feasibility and need for immediate pursuit of Phase II efforts.    The immediate benefit will be reduced repair depot operational costs as a result of:  A) higher throughput, B) reduced rework, C)reduced flow days, D) reduced metallurgical laboratory testing, E) reduced consumable material cost, F) reduced maintenance of equipment, and, G) reduced engineering support.    If the government approves the release of the new material specifications, OEM&amp;quot;s and commercial applicators will have the option of using them.  The intent is to have the new set of material specifications be a subset of the existing material specifications to minimize the need for T.O. documentation changes or requalification."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The thermal spray process has many inherent complexities within each sub-process including feedstock manufacturing, component surface preparation and masking, torch parameter selection, robot trajectory and laboratory coating evaluation.  Each sub-process is governed by rigid specifications that provide thermal spray applicators with procedural and process guidelines throughout the application.  Current aerospace thermal spray specifications are not adequate to capture many nuances in feedstock procurement and process management.  This allows non-optimal, yet conforming materials and processes to be used during overhaul and repair yielding unsatisfactory outcomes in some instances especially in cost and productivity.  ReliaCoat Technologies, a small business specializing in advanced thermal spray concepts, will perform a detailed analysis of present coating specifications to determine the most critical areas of the process which are prone to variability in spite of operating within specifications.  ReliaCoat&amp;quot;s strategy aims to improve these specifications from within: i.e. operate the materials and processes within the scope of the specifications but introduce robustness through in-process gates and appropriate knowledge management tools to shrink variability and tighten distribution.  This will allow cognizant engineers to benefit from the outcome without moving away from decades of experience base, while process engineers will be able to use tools to improve productivity.  BENEFIT:  The benefits anticipated by investigating and implementing modified coating specifications include the following; reduction of laboratory test frequency, reduction of time required for qualification by minimizing process variability, increasing throughput of parts coated and minimizing the amount of rework, together providing higher productivity and enabling high velocity maintenance scenarios.  The in-process gates will provide a deeper insight into thermal spray processing, enhancing the operator&amp;quot;s understanding of process variables.  ReliaCoat is aiming to provide integrated process management solutions to the thermal spray industry via expert knowledge in materials science and process engineering into ruggedized yet readily adaptable industrial tools with user friendly software."

Wastewater treatment processes with MFC&amp;#039;s employ bacteria to generate electrical power produced as they breakdown organic materials captured from wastewater. FTL Labs Corporation (FTL) proposes a powerful new enabling technology for wastewater power generation using high-capacity flow-through microbiological fuel cells developed and proven in the laboratory of Dr. Caitlyn Butler, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.&amp;quot;ElectroSeptic&amp;quot;is based on technology that has been tested at the milliliter level in the laboratory, 50-liter level in the field, and scalable to the 100 gallon per day level in the Phase I program. ElectroSeptic has been created with real-world return-on-investment as a primary design goal. Excellent performance is achieved through a self-optimizing bio-electrode approach and innovative flow-entrained charge transfer. ElectroSeptic sequesters nitrogen and extracts energy from the wastewater continuously emanating from human populations.  BENEFIT:  The proposed technology, when implemented, will allow a significant enhancement in microbial fuel cells for simultaneous power generation and wastewater treatment. In addition to this important application to the U.S. Department of Defense, civilian markets such as unattended latrines and off-grid power generation may develop as a significant market for the resultant technologies. In applications that require mature, fieldable, and effective wastewater fuel cells, FTL Labs&amp;quot;s (FTL&amp;quot;s) ElectroSeptic wastewater power generation  technology can find a growing market."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A challenge which continues to present a barrier to the utilization of AM and wide spread adoption is knowing when to use the technology. This is particularly problematic in aerospace and in MRO operations because the technology is still emerging, and knowledgeable, experienced practitioners remain in short supply and will likely remain so until the next generation of technicians and engineers are in the workforce. There is a large disparity between those that are truly knowledgeable (practitioners) and those who are familiar with the technology. The more parts\/tooling that are built or attempted increases the knowledge base and ultimately will help push the adoption of AM technology. While caution should not be abandoned in exchange for speed, technology can come to the aid of the practitioners. The opportunity and proposed innovation, and subject matter of this proposal, is to determine the feasibility of leveraging advanced shape extraction algorithms, ontology model application, and an extensible knowledgebase to interrogate the depot&amp;quot;s part geometry and ascertain which weapon system components, or perhaps even more appropriate, what supporting production tooling are candidates for AM.  BENEFIT:  The proposed solution will ultimately result in reduced maintenance and acquisition costs, decreased maintenance lifecycles, and reduction of acquisition cost for the maintenance of various systems. This effort will present a conceptual architecture and design to establish a benchmark and guidelines for the depot sustainment engineers to identify whether AM is a viable and economical alternative to conventional manufacturing methods for legacy weapon tooling and components. Demonstrable prototype of AMAS that will be used to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed AMAS operational system. Success will promote the use of AM in the DoD depots."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This project will develop a methodology to assist Air Force Sustainment Centers (AFSC) sustainment engineers and procurement personnel to rapidly acquire certified parts using Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies. AFSC are experiencing difficulty in supporting military hardware as many systems are beyond expected service life and require significant maintenance. The U.S. industrial base is shrinking and AFSC procurement offices have fewer options when placing orders to support these aging systems. AFSC buyers frequently wait a month for a quote after they have found a capable supplier. Fortunately AM technologies have the potential to ameliorate many of these problems. However, with any emerging technology, it is difficult to compare, contrast and apply the most appropriate technology for the fabrication of replacement components. As such, CalRAM will provide AFSC personnel the ability to quickly determine if a part is a candidate for an AM process, select the process, and place an order for a part. AM quotes can be generated in hours. The methodology will consist of a set of&amp;quot;Filters&amp;quot;that eliminate simple or common parts like nuts and bolts and focus on high payoff parts to be produced by the best value AM process.  BENEFIT:  A methodology will be established to rapidly screen candidate legacy parts for fabrication by Additive Manufacturing (AM). AM parts are capable of providing the same quality as conventionally fabricated parts, but with much reduced cost and schedule."

This objective will be accomplished by creating a guided decision framework that determines if a part aligns with the critical process characteristics and economics of AM methods.  BENEFIT:  When an engineer in a Sustainment Center is faced with the challenge of producing an out-of-production legacy part, the selection of the manufacturing method must be consistent with the OEM specifications and properties for reliable function of the part.  Additive Manufacturing, as a new emerging process, is making available an alternate approach for rapidly generating a shape for manufacturing or possibly the net-shape finished part that is needed. Having a&amp;quot;process selection&amp;quot;guide or&amp;quot;evaluation&amp;quot;methodology available would be an effective first step in applying AM methods within the Sustainment Centers."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Global Technology Connection, Inc., in collaboration with its academic and industrial partners proposes to develop a hierarchical 3-tier fault tolerant architecture to improve aircraft reliability, safety, and availability.  The hierarchical system will support autonomous decisions for aircraft mission modification, trajectory planning, and low-level controller reconfiguration.  At the low-level of the architecture, a Fault-Adaptive Control Technology (FACT) is used that continuously monitor for faults\/failures and reconfigures low-level controllers using an active model approach in order to maintain stable control over the aircraft.   The diagnostic and prognostic methodology will fuse health information at the aircraft component, subsystem, and system levels in order to improve the accuracy and reliability of the health assessment.  Fault and failure information is sent to the top-level and mid-levels of the architecture to support mission and trajectory planning, respectively.   Based on the current aircraft health state, a mission modification module determines the appropriate high-level control actions such as modifying the sequence of mission tasks and switching between different objectives (extend life \/ maintain control).   A case-based reasoning module is used to draw upon past mission modification successful and failed experiences. At the mid-level, a path planner is then used to generate appropriate aircraft trajectories based on selected mission, environmental conditions, and current and predicted health states.  Phase I shall concentrate on the fault tolerant architecture development and feasibility demonstration.   In Phase II, a working prototype of the framework will be implemented and verified\/validated on a relevant aircraft system.   The technology will be transitioned to commercial applications in Phase III to both military and civilian aircraft applications as a framework package along with design and test tools.  BENEFIT:  The fault tolerant system, Fault Evaluation, Adaptation, and Tolerant System (FEATS), will provide improved reliability, safety, and available for manned and unmanned aircraft systems.  The system can handle not only a single fault\/failure, but multiple aircraft faults\/failures from various aircraft subsystems and components.  FEATS will provide reliable autonomous decision making in the presence of aircraft fault\/failures to increase the chances of mission success and prevention of vehicle loss.  There is huge commercial potential for this type of system in aircraft, ship and ground autonomous systems to detect and predict failures and provide on-line compensation for failed systems.  NASA&amp;quot;s unmanned landing systems, commercial aircraft, automobiles, automated manufacturing, etc. could also benefit from this technology."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Aurora Flight Sciences, in collaboration with Worcester Polytechnic Institute, proposes the development of the Real-Time Safety-Assured Autonomous Aircraft (RTS3A) system. The system dynamically performs decision-making based on both sensed and predictive information to carry out adaptive missions and maintenance. This system leverages sensing capabilities distributed throughout subsystems of the aircraft that measure characteristics to allow prediction of the conditional response of the aircraft.  The RTS3A system incorporates multi-disciplinary, physics-based models and sensor suites to fully functionalize the flight environment of an aircraft with respect to its structural and propulsion capabilities, which allows for optimization of mission execution as well as condition based maintenance. Distributed sensors and reasoning agents will generate real-time information on subsystems of the vehicle, and each subsystem will communicate with a higher-level system-reasoning agent. A central reasoning agent, informed by the lower level agents as well as real-time updates to the flight environment, will manage mission control systems in order to adapt the maneuver envelop which influences the vehicle&amp;quot;s control authority. The central reasoning agent will ensure minimum margins of flight safety under uncertain and constantly changing conditions. Initial implementation of the self-aware vehicle concept is suggested on unmanned systems, such as Aurora&amp;quot;s Orion Unmanned Aerial System.  BENEFIT:  This Phase I program will demonstrate the feasibility of a prototype RTS3A system applied to two subsystems, airframe and the propulsion, of a typical aircraft. Prognosis will be based on physics-based models with data to reduce and manage uncertainty. Critical and typical failure modes for the subsystems will be incorporated into the software, allowing aircraft safety to be monitored during uncertain flight conditions. Prognosis of faults and failures in composite airframes allow for the extension of vehicle health management onto the structure, which typically represents the largest portion of the aircraft weight and cost for both maintenance and replacement. Incorporating the propulsion subsystem allows initial realization of the self-aware vehicle concept. Prognostics would allow for condition-based maintenance of airframe and propulsion components, reducing maintenance costs associated with an air vehicle while allowing real-time safety of the vehicle to be monitored."

        "abstract": "RE2, Inc. proposes to develop a specialized payload for the Squad-Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) vehicle to assist the combat medic with extraction of a combat casualty in dangerous environments. The combat medic is one of the most dangerous and demanding responsibilities in warfare. Often in the course of reaching, assessing, and treating a wounded soldiers injuries, the combat medic and other personnel are placed directly in harms way. As a result many medics and soldiers have been injured or killed while trying to save others under hostile conditions. There is on-going interest to understand how unmanned robotics technologies can be used to reduce the risk of injury to the combat medic and other personnel when attempting to rescue and extract wounded soldiers in hostile or dangerous situations. The solution that is proposed to be designed as a payload for the S-MET vehicle, named LIFELINE, is intended to be a practical and relatively uncomplicated solution for unmanned casualty extraction with the goal of getting the casualty from the point of injury to the unmanned S-MET transport vehicle as quickly as possible for eventual transport back to a Casualty Collection Point or a Medical Evacuation Point."

This proposal describes a rapid immunochromatographic diagnostic test for gastroenteritis caused by Norovirus (NoV) infection.The test shall be used in combination with a portable reader (powered by rechargeable batteries) for automated reading and interpretation.The proposed solution is small, lightweight, and insensitive to environmental extremes such as dust, high humidity, and storage temperatures of up to 45C. The test will have high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate from other enteric infectious agents, and shall be able to detect norovirus infection at the onset of symptoms. Time to result is expected to be 20-30 minutes, and many tests can be run in parallel. Major advantages of this diagnostic method are that it is soldier-friendly, is non-invasive, is likely to be consistent with obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance as a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-waived diagnostic device, and provides rapid detection of the presence of infection.The rapid identification of the diarrhea-causing pathogen will help to initiate immediate intervention."

        "abstract": "Development of complex systems requires attention to Human Systems Integration (HSI)the earlier the better. Systems engineering (SE) aims to balance discipline-specific concerns along with overall project cost, schedule, performance, and risk. The Framework for Assessing Cost and Technology (FACT) project uses SysML modeling and coupled simulation technology to dramatically improve concurrent SE early in concept development. However, FACT does not yet include modules supporting modeling and simulationand hence requirement-relevant preliminary assessmentsfor HSI disciplines.  Stottler Henke proposes to develop tools that integrate with FACT under the rubric Concurrent HSI Analysis for Systems Engineering (CHASE). CHASE will leverage profile-extensible SysML modeling and existing HSI-relevant simulation approaches and tools. It will provide several distinctive capabilities: (1) standardized HSI model and metadata vocabularies; (2) reusable HSI-relevant model libraries; (3) heuristic modeling and analysis guidance; (4) automated simulation configuration; and (5) easier surrogate model generation.  During Phase I, we will develop use cases and requirements, characterize key technologies for modeling and simulation, develop a core design, build a limited proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate feasibility, and develop a plan for Phase II."

        "abstract": "As military systems continue to grow more complex, there is a pressing need to concurrently advance maintenance training systems to accurately assess skill acquisition and decay, while incorporating interactive stimuli. Instead of training procedural skills in isolation, we broaden the training scope to include learning problem-solving strategies, (e.g. diagnosing a problem and selecting a procedure to address it), metacognitive strategies, (e.g. assessing the effectiveness of ones current activities), and conceptual knowledge, (e.g. a cause-and-effect mental model of how a mechanical or electronic system works), all informed by current advances in learning sciences. We will design and develop a compelling game-based maintenance trainer for a U.S. Navy Gun Mount currently in use in the fleet. We will utilize intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) as they provide a realistic task environment and enable individualized coaching. The anticipated benefits include a comprehensive skill acquisition module that can track individual skill level and predict required training and refresher courses to minimize skill atrophy. In Phase I, CTIs interdisciplinary team will develop a concept and design document for a virtual environment maintenance trainer with assessment tools for skill acquisition and decay. In Phase II, a prototype system will be developed and delivered for US Navy evaluation."

SI2 will leverage recently flight tested wideband technology developed for the RQ-21a Blackjack to provide instantaneous coverage of the full band of interest with a minimal number of sub-bands and components. The antenna system will have omni-directional well characterized pattern coverage which is ideal for the intended end use. The payload will allow for integration of other atmospheric sensors, such as a humidity gauge and functions, such as direction finding or angle of arrival estimation. SI2s experience developing UAV payloads enables a laboratory scale demonstration on Phase I and a full-scale flight test prototype during Phase II."

To acquire the necessary data, the Navy needs a system integrated with the ScanEagle Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capable of analyzing distant signals of opportunity while meeting strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements placed on hardware payloads. To meet this need, Nokomis will provide a fully integrated system by leveraging existing Hiawatha capabilities and in-house experience developing small UAV antenna systems on platforms including the Silver Fox and Scheibel Camcopter. The Hiawatha system provides sensitive long range automated spectrum analysis and integrated Angle of Arrival (AoA) capabilities and signal source classification through a suite of detection and identification algorithms. Hiawatha is capable of covering 30 MHz to 18 GHz and a lightweight (1.7 lbs) version of the system has been flight tested over 30 MHz to 3 GHz. Under the Phase I Nokomis will demonstrate Hiawatha capabilities from a UAV through an outdoor range-based hang test, develop an azimuthally independent antenna system suitable for integration with the ScanEagle, and develop a system design and associated trades for an enhanced Phase II prototype expanding system frequency range and meeting SWaP and interface requirements."

        "abstract": "Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes to design, develop and implement a complete dynamic spectrum access (DSA) system operating with single transceiver (ST) radios on a cognitive mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Addressing the single-transceiver requirement along with additional restrictions on channel availability, and other sensing spectrum access capabilities (e.g., due to national policies), the proposed ST-DSA system is empowered by a distributed design (without central controller) where cognitive radios perform collective spectrum management, channel estimation, topology discovery and transmission control (time, space, frequency) to form a self-healing multi-hop cognitive MANET. ST-DSA implements a complete cognitive engine that conducts collective spectrum sensing over licensed and unlicensed spectrum to produce near real-time spectrum map of dynamic topology structures. Radios with ST-DSA capability utilize the spectrum map and apply cross-layer design to joint spectrum access and routing (with backpressure algorithm over multiple frequency bands) to carry tactical data (voice and standard IP data) over the cognitive MANET. The transmission decisions supporting spectral agility include the selection of the next-hop neighbor, the channel (frequency band), power, rate, and traffic flow over the cognitive MANET."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for a man-packable, wireless microserver with clustering to support company-sized units and below, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Man-Packable Expeditionary Tactical Server (METS). METS is based on a multiprocessor design with software defined radio (SDR) for tactical communication and data distribution, solid-state disk storage for speed and ruggedness, and a battery allowing recharging from multiple tactical edge power sources. METS will contain an extensive software suite for a METS server cluster in a mesh networking configuration. The METS networking cluster supports a tactical cloud to eliminate the need for company-sized units and below to reach-back to congested remote C2 nodes and reduce the processing time by distributing compute-intensive tasks among multiple METS servers. In Phase I, POC will develop systems engineering models, perform trade-off studies between potential design alternatives, and identify a METS design that satisfies the Navys requirements under various environmental conditions and tactical scenarios. System engineering alternatives will be evaluated in the context of form factor, power, system cooling, data-distribution, processing, and information-assurance capabilities. During Phase II, POC will engineer and construct a METS prototype. The capabilities of the Phase II prototype will be demonstrated in a controlled environment."

It allows remote users to store, share, and discover information from authorized devices connected to the network. Secure, compact, ruggedized, and easy to reconfigure and relocate, the MCS can be used in Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), vehicles, or carried by soldiers in remote areas where backhaul communications are unavailable. The MCS can serve dozens of mobile devices simultaneously, allowing commanders and squad members connected to the network to communicate and share information, making mission critical data virtually available to users anywhere at any time. Planning and Future Operations, Logistic and Maintenance, Communications, Information Systems, Medical Operations, and Training and Exercises can all benefit from the MCS real-time data processing, cloud storage, and analysis tools. The MCS offers a major military advantage by allowing users anywhere on the battlefield to process, send, and receive data."

        "abstract": "To fully exploit the state of climate science, though, requires that we expand and improve ACAF capabilities to better meet the BonD strategy. This requires a more robust, scalable supporting framework that can easily add new data resources; transform these data into actionable information with uncertainty estimates in the operators and planners decision space; and distribute effectively the computational and network burden among operational and tactical environments. Extending ACAF with these capabilities will significantly improve METOC support to the field, and better extend decision superiority to Fleet and DoD forces. The overarching goal of this research effort is to put more, and more effective, climate-based decision-support tools in to the hands of METOC personnel, mission planners and warfighters."

It has a SWAP of 10cm12cm1.5cm, 2lB, and less than 2.8W. It is much smaller than any available USB spectrum analyzer plus a small PC. The system divides the covered frequency band (100MHz ~ 14GHz) into three sub-bands (sub-band I - 100 ~ 800MHz, sub-band II - 0.8 ~ 7GHz, sub-band - III 7 ~ 14GHz) and each sub-band is covered using a set of antennas (three same antennas for DOA estimation) and the following receivers. The two higher frequency sub-band antenna sets are fixed relatively to each other (each set will be on one PCB board) and lower frequency sub-band antennas are installed on ScanEagle wings and fuselage (there may be some errors due to installation and wing shape change in flying, but it is tolerated for the relative large wavelength). The micro-controller will select which sub-band will work and what frequency signal will be collected. At any time, the system only works on one sub-band, and the other two are turned off to save power. The DOA estimation capability is for precise EM signal power measurement."

These results will enable the Navy to perform a tradeoff analysis of the sonobuoy system to meet their operational requirements and form-factor constraint.   Using Navy-supplied location data, Makai will characterize the ocean environment in the area of operation and use Navy 4D temporal ocean current models as input to a hydro-mechanical numerical model to evaluate the dynamic loads on the different sonobuoy components (especially on the long and thin tether) will be compared to the manufacturer-specified component limits. The drift of single and multi-buoys over 30 days will be observed, as the acoustic coverage is an important metric for the Navy. The goal of this parametric study is to characterize how various component parameters (e.g., tether diameter, sizes, drag, weights, specific gravities): 1) affect individual sonobuoy space and weight; 2) perform against the system 30-day operational requirement and form-factor constraint; and, 3) influence single and multi-buoy geometry and barrier drift."

        "abstract": "A unique undersea acoustic phenomenon called Reliable Acoustic Path (RAP) offers an opportunity for a paradigm shift in air-ASW CONOPS. In areas where the ocean reaches sufficient depths, the density of the water increases to the point where the speed of sound exceeds that at the surface. An acoustic receiver placed below this critical depth benefits from greatly improved signal to noise ratio. The Next Generation Airborne Passive System FNC, or NGAPS, was born out of this research. NGAPS will provide the fleet with persistent, broad area surveillance by positioning passive receive arrays at RAP depths. A single P-8 aircraft is capable of deploying an extremely large area field comprised of 25-100 receivers. Recent studies funded by PMA-264 suggest that free drifting RAP-depth buoys can be designed to limit drift speeds so that a field can maintain integrity for weeks at a time. The opportunity, then, is to develop a long life (30-90 days) RAP sonobuoy in an A-size form factor capable of performing in-buoy processing and sending OTH contact reports. This capability will dramatically reduce the cost of conducting long term anti-access, area-denial ASW in deep water, while freeing valuable P-8 flight hours for other missions."

This approach will allow end users and FNMOC analysts to manipulate the latest climate, meteorological, and oceanographic gridded data to generate derived decision support products through ACAF web services by the innovative use of a domain-specific scripting language. This ACAF gridded domain-specific language will allow access to FNMOC&apos;s programming, utility, and 3rd party libraries and applications at runtime, which will eliminate external development costs and permit the creation of derived product libraries for researchers and end users. The proposed architecture solution will provide an engineering approach to obtain, record, archive, and generate climate and METOC gridded data accessible to ACAF users and analysts. The system will be capable to auto-generate a standard set of products, as well as allow users to generate ad hoc non-standard derived products through web services. The resulting derived decision support products will be available in a number of user selectable formats for visualization and integration into Command and Control and Geographic Information Systems (GISs)."

        "abstract": "The US Navy faces several limitations when planning operations in regard to forecasting environmental conditions. Currently, mission analysis and planning tools rely heavily on short-term (less than a week) forecasts or long-term statistical climate products. However, newly available data in the form of weather forecast ensembles provides dynamical and statistical extended-range predictions that will produce more accurate predictions if ensemble members can be combined correctly. Charles River Analytics proposes a Climatological Observations for Maritime Prediction and Analysis Support Service (COMPASS), which performs data fusion over extended-range multi-model ensembles to produce a unified forecast for several weeks to several seasons in the future. We will evaluate and select the data using probabilistic programming (PP) and data fusion and association techniques. Further, we will perform state estimation and prediction in an effort to produce an all-encompassing and superior forecast that can be used to inform the Navys decision planning process."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need to provide existing and emerging single-transceiver radios with the capability to autonomously and dynamically access and manage spectrum, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Single Transceiver Radio Efficient Dynamic Spectrum Access for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (STREAM) system. This system will allow single-transceiver radios in a platoon-sized mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) of 20 or more nodes to autonomously and dynamically access and manage the spectrum to increase spectral efficiency and network throughput. The proposed system will leverage in-house self-interference reduction and spectrum sensing techniques, together with state-of-the-art methods for spectrum management and mobility, optimized to maximize network throughput, while minimizing latency and transceiver power usage. As a result, the STREAM system will deliver frequency selection and transitions in under 500 milliseconds while maintaining high network throughput on a MANET of 20 or more single-transceiver nodes, which supports the envisioned network scenario of a platoon-size dismounted patrol in an urban environment. POC plans to develop in Phase I a technical description of the STREAM system and demonstrate the feasibility via simulation and measurements with an in-house software-defined radio testbed. In Phase II, POC will develop prototype nodes to assess the STREAM system."

        "abstract": "Future hypersonic vehicles will be required to fly extended, long term trajectories where the bod-ies must exhibit high lift-to-drag (L\/D) ratios. The need for reduced drag means that the nosetips and leading edges must have small radii, shallow wedge angles, and be erosion resistant. Desira-ble dimensions include a nose radius on the order of 0.040 inch and a wedge half angle of about 3. This radius is an order of magnitude finer than the existing state of the art. Existing carbon-carbons and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) made with commercial carbon yarns (2K and 3K tows) result in nosetips and leading edges with radii of 0.5 inch or greater. Fine radii also create operational problems because aerodynamic heat loads increase as the radius decreases. This means that high L\/D nosetips and leading edges will be exposed to high temperatures in an oxi-dizing environment for long periods of time. Thus in order to maintain a sharp radius the nosetips and leading edges must be erosion resistant and able to withstand significant thermal stresses. Thus the problem is to develop low erosion, thermal stress resistant ceramic matrix com-posites at a geometric scale that is an order of magnitude finer than the existing state of the art.       In order to solve this problem Materials Research &amp; Design (MR&amp;D) proposes to develop fine braided tungsten (W) wire CMCs that meet the goals for fine geometry, low erosion, and thermal stress resistance. The proposed effort builds upon past successful collaborations between MR&amp;D and two other businesses. Specifically DE Technologies (DET) and MR&amp;D have de-signed, analyzed, developed and demonstrated high strength tungsten reinforced braided com-posites for severe impact applications. Additionally MR&amp;D has supported Exothermics in the development of manufacturing methods to densify chopped W\/HfN composites for high temper-ature erosion resistant CMCs. The proposed Phase I program will bring this team together to de-sign, analyze, fabricate, and characterize fine braided W\/HfN CMC leading edges. MR&amp;D will manage the program, analyze the response of the CMC to a hypersonic trajectory, and design braid architectures that will survive the conditions. DET will braid both representative leading edge preforms and additional preforms for densification and characterization. Exothermics will densify the braided tungsten preforms using their process of hafnium slurry infiltration followed by nitridation and HIPping. If this Base program is successful, braided W\/HfN billets will be characterized at SoRI as part of the Option for critical material properties including thermal con-ductivity, thermal expansion, and high temperature strength."

The objective is to design, build and test a sub-array of piezoelectric single crystal Tonpilz SONAR transducers that can be steered over large angles with high directivity and low side lobe levels. These objectives will be accomplished through not only experimental but also theoretical means. Critical issues to be addressed include: element uniformity in large-scale production, array mounting structure that prevents element-to-element crosstalk, and minimizing the effect of coupling of elements through the medium itself. In this proposal we discuss these critical issues and will investigate possible means for minimizing adverse effects on array performance. In addition to analytical analysis and array interaction programs, finite element modeling will also be used in conjunction with the fabrication and evaluation of a sub-array of Tonpilz single crystal transducer elements."

        "abstract": "Todays Navy electronics maintenance training largely focuses on proceduralization of diagnosis and repair, rather than deep systems knowledge. This training is effective at producing durable skills for common systems, but brittle, especially for dealing with unique characteristics and properties of actual shipboard systems. With continuing modernization of equipment and growing unavailability of skilled maintainers, the Navys challenge is to both deepen the knowledge and skills of apprentice technicians and accelerate troubleshooting training. Soar Technology and its team proposes that key to meeting this challenge is to situate and tailor training. Embedding training in an engaging, interactive instructional environment and tailoring it to specific student competencies can reduce training time while enhancing motivation and improving transfer. The SoarTech team will address five objectives: (1) Define operational needs to ground the design and implementation on specific Navy maintenance systems training demands; (2) identify novel instructional strategies and leverage state-of-the-art game technology; (3) prioritize instruction and tailoring using generalized troubleshooting training with targeted assessment; (4) design an integrated software architecture that provides a realistic practice environment, targeted instruction and practice, fine-grained assessment, and instrumentation of student performance; and (5) research acquisition and decay models to enable longitudinal modeling tracking of students skill development."

Our advanced interface technologies will support visual, auditory, haptic, and olfactory modalities and our advanced embedded assessments will measure cognitive, perceptual, and psychomotor skills. The integration of these interfaces and assessments will be guided by the long-term (i.e., Phase II) goal of optimizing the training experience for acquisition and sustainment of naval engineering maintenance skills.

To meet this need, we will design and demonstrate the feasibility of Maintenance Enhancement with Next-Generation Development of Skills (MENDS). MENDS is a next-generation maintenance training system and immersive game-based training environment with empirically validated training protocols, assessment tools, and models of skill acquisition and decay. MENDS features (1) the KRK theory of learning and retention applied to maintenance training; (2) an immersive game-based maintenance simulation built on DiSTIs GLStudio; (3) the D2P tutoring framework with mobile skill refreshing; and (4) our methodology for annotated skill trees (MAST) to represent and assess trainee skills.

Acquiring and, more importantly, retaining the technical skills for corrective maintenance of these complex systems is a significant challenge for the Navy. What is needed is an efficient technology for assessing, training, and retraining diagnosis and repair skills among technicians who maintain complex shipboard systems. The next generation tool that we propose to develop to support this initiative is called ASYMPTOTE: A SYMPle Tool for Optimal Technical Education. ASYMPTOTE rigorously measures, models, and predicts future parameters of the arc of learning and forgetting. It includes a device model that fails and tests realistically in a portable, virtual environment. Learning tasks test diagnostic and repair skills, and those are plotted on the learning curve during the training instant. The solution supports training in the schoolhouse with instructor support and retraining on demand on deployment by an independent trainee. In short, ASYMPTOTE represents the physical and functional device; is accessible (portable) and engaging, to encourage use; and measures, models, and manages skill acquisition and decay."

        "abstract": "The goal of this Phase I program is to develop broadband single crystal sonar for the ATT. Single crystal piezoelectric is a high energy density, highly efficient piezoelectric material that is being used to develop acoustic and ultrasonic transducers with bandwidths much higher than has been possible with conventional ceramic materials. For sonar, broad bandwidth is especially important for operations in littoral waters where sensitivity to a wide frequency range is important for sorting out signals of interest in a noisy and acoustically cluttered environment. In fact, it has been shown for many sonar applications that single crystals can provide broadband response (bandwidth &gt;100%) and increased acoustic power in a much smaller transducer size that requires less electrical power. This makes single crystal sonar ideal for compact space and power constrained platforms such as towed minehunters, UUVs USVs, countermeasures, ACOMMS buoys, and torpedoes. TRS and Penn State ARL will develop and qualify single crystal transducer arrays for the ATT. Broad bandwidth will enable the realization of expanded mission goals such as salvo operation TRS and ARL will then optimize the design of single crystal transducers for the torpedo, and conduct standard single element transducer tests to verify performance."

Exploiting single crystal piezoelectrics in Tonpilz transducers has led to single transducer elements with enhanced bandwidth, sensitivity, and source level in a smaller, lighter package when compared with legacy piezoceramic elements. This topic addresses the next step, namely, building these single elements into large arrays with good array directivity and low sidelobes when steered over large angles, both in transmission and reception. Critical issues to be addressed include: element uniformity in large scale production, an array mounting structure that prevents element-to-element crosstalk, and minimizing coupling of elements mediated through the medium itself (seawater)."

However, dynamic range constraints still persist in an ever more crowded spectrum. Filters can provide cosite interference mitigation but have limitations in real life components that exhibit self-resonances and parasitic impairments. These create flyback responses that create serious limitations in wideband systems. The anticipated benefit of the proposed approach is a filter structure that avoids the impacts created by the flybacks. The commercial strategy includes penetrating market both with the SoC implementation in this program as well as more typical implementations."

        "abstract": "Over the past decade the research community has generated thousands of papers dealing with many different aspects of dynamic spectrum access, cognitive radios and opportunistic networking. Surprisingly, however, only a handful have addressed an end to end DSA communication system, and to the best of our knowledge none have looked at how DSA can be enabled in a single transceiver legacy radio. This is per-haps not surprising since the research community is seldom concerned about the transitionability of their results. By striving for optimality we often require new approaches that require new waveforms or hard-ware architectures and as such ignore the vast investment already made in legacy equipment and the dec-ade long pipeline of program of record (PoR) approved equipment that is yet to be fielded. In our proposed approach we look to strike a balance between maximizing throughput gain via DSA and maximizing the probability for a timely and successful transition. Our approach is based on a novel mechanism for sensing of the spectrum and exchange of the sensing data within the network without any interruption of the data traffic and without any hardware blocks external to the legacy radio."

This proposed system is based on a new design that uses fine-grain parallelism in the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) numerical weather prediction model and recent advancements in graphics processing unit (GPU) technologies. An innovative new system design with customized hardware and software will enable the MPREP system to forecast in near real time the refractivity of the environment around a ship to a range of 32 nautical miles. As a result, this system enables software routines, such as the Advanced Refractive Effects Prediction System (AREPS), to predict electromagnetic wave propagation with high fidelity to support prediction of radar, electronic warfare, and communication system operation, directly addressing the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of MPREP by providing details of hardware and software designs, along with benchmark code and measurement results. In Phase II, POC plans to build a prototype system at a Technology Readiness Level of 5 to demonstrate and validate the MPREP design."

For example, maritime radars operate at S Band (2.9-3.1 GHz) and X Band (9.0-9.7 GHz) and the ships are required to broadcast their position using the AIS system."

The need to characterize the dynamic response of deformable membrane mirrors is key to their efficient design and effective operation in future high bandwidth AO systems that can compensate in real-time for atmospheric turbulence. This proposal by Advanced Systems and Technologies, Inc. (AS&amp;T) directly responds to the above NAVY needs with a unique and comprehensive testing station that employs an architecture supporting multiple modalities of optical metrology tailored specifically for DM devices and MEMS arrays. We describe a novel optical non-contact sensor fusion concept, the Multi-mode Interferometer for Evaluation of Dynamics in Adaptive-optic Systems (MIEDAS) that supports full dynamic and static characterization of deformable membrane mirrors.  The unparalleled measurement capabilities incorporated in MIEDAS are uniquely suited to the new sensor technologies sought by the Navy for comprehensive DM characterization. This proposal lays out a work plan leading towards a Phase II prototype instrument that will provide a comprehensive test and evaluation platform for future Navy adaptive optic system developments."

The dielectric formulation and capacitor design will be optimized to minimize the equivalent series resistance (ESR) to achieve the high speed discharging.

In response, we will design and develop an adaptable, plug-and-play system, SEE-DATA, to identify opportunistic sensors and extract features to characterize and exploit the data in real-time. In Phase I, we will:   Develop methods to identify opportunistic sensors for information needs of users and algorithms, and update sensor selection for evolving operations.   Design a system concept for opportunistic sensor identification and exploitation to provide plug-and-play, cloud-compatible tool integration for characterizing and exploiting real-time sensor data.  Capture user requirements for specifying information needs, structuring analysis, and annotating data for search and collaboration.  Demonstrate opportunistic sensor identification and exploitation using data from multiple sensors and sensor types to show the validity of our approach."

Specifically, a 0.25W energy harvesting system will be designed, developed and tested in the laboratory environment. When attached to a recharging battery, this 0.25W energy harvesting system will be able to power smaller sized unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) such as underwater floats and gliders. The developed 0.25W prototype will have an immediate impact on the international Argo float market. With the thermal recharging battery, the fast sampling float can now collect data more frequently than 10 days while still maintaining a multi-year mission life. The Bio-Argo float can measure nitrate, oxygen and pH in the ocean. Results from the 0.25W energy harvesting system will be used to scale up and design a 2kW power station that can be used to power larger sized UUVs through a docking device. The developed ocean energy harvesting system will not only increase the endurance for UUVs, but also eliminate the need for ships and sailors in order to recover and recharge UUV batteries."

        "abstract": "The ability to capture wide instantaneous bandwidth is essential for analysis of various signals-of-interest. Superconductor analog-to-digital converters (ADC) offer discriminating advantages in both bandwidth and fidelity due to very high sampling rates and quantum-accurate digitization based on counting of magnetic flux quanta. Multiple digital-RF receiver systems incorporating superconductor ADCs have been in operation for over two years in field-ready configurations at Government laboratories, and have demonstrated direct digitization of RF signals above 20 GHz. We propose to augment the superconductor ADC technology by integrating superconductor analog band-reject filters. Our prior expertise will allow us to not only design, but to build, and demonstrate a hardware prototype of the key element of the proposed wideband receiver, the combination of tunable analog filter and ADC, during Phase I. In Phase II, we will increase the complexity of the scalable architecture developed during Phase I to build, demonstrate and deliver a wideband RF digitizer with multiple integrated tunable filters for operation and testing to a designated Government facility."

        "abstract": "In this SBIR program, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes a PCM-based ocean thermal energy harvesting system to provide reliable, renewable, on-board electrical generation for autonomous underwater vehicles and platforms. This affordable and scalable system harvests energy from the natural temperature gradients that exist in the ocean. ACTs novel design efficiently extracts heat from the surrounding water at warmer depths, and rejects waste heat into the surrounding water at cooler depths. The thermal energy extracted from the ocean is stored in volumes of phase change material (PCM) and made available to an on-board power cycle for continuous electrical generation regardless of depth or ocean temperature. The advantage of the proposed technology is the flexibility in the design of the power cycle which enables scalability to systems of up to 2kW of on-board electrical generation. The proposed technology could substantially increase the operational lifetime of underwater gliders and floats used for scientific measurements and surveillance capability. Larger ocean energy harvesting systems could serve as charging stations for underwater vehicles, or provide grid power more affordably than current OTEC systems. The objective of the Phase I program is to develop and test a 0.25W proof-of-concept prototype."

        "abstract": "Military and open-source data contain a wealth of information about entities of interest to US and coalition forces. This information is in the form of unstructured text, audio, imagery, video, SIGINT, and structured data. Intelligence analysts have access to these distributed, disparate data sources but are severely limited in exploiting the information. The success of military and security operations often depend on the level of situational awareness. A primary intelligence task is the development of patterns of life for the target of interest to determine target intent based on observation. To meet this challenge, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC) and the Stevens Institute of Technology proposes a system for Opportunistic Real-time Analysis, Content Labeling and Exploitation (ORACLE) from multi-modal sensory data. The ORACLE system will enable real-time threat analysis and situational awareness from multi-modal data sources by automatically identifying the targets of interest, providing intent prediction based on patterns of life, and enabling the analyst to annotate targets of interest at both the (video) frame level and topic (event) level for future search. ORACLE will provide a distributed operational environment, where analysts from different departments, each with their own databases and perspectives, can analyze and collaborate on a common platform."

        "abstract": "For many analysis tasks, the frame-level contextual understanding including query and content tagging on the multimedia data will provide time-critical actionable intelligence and insights. However, such frame-level capability does not exist for multimedia streams and files. To address this need, IAI, along with our collaborators, proposes to develop a Scalable and Real-time Hybrid Multimodal Content Exploitation System: HExp (Hybrid Exploitation). The key innovation is to seamlessly and systematically integrate information retrieval methods in different information spaces through theoretically sound retrieval models so that intelligence analysts can search multimedia contents in both the structured and unstructured spaces. HExp serves as a software system for intelligence analysts to search, tagging and tracking multimedia frames based on the dimensions of time, location, and event categories. HExp consists of three subsystems in different layers: (1) the distributed video\/audio annotating and tagging subsystem that transform raw files into text descriptions and semantic entities and relations, (2) distributed hybrid information retrieval subsystem that index the unstructured and structured information from multimedia data using four different retrieval models, and (3) context-sensitive user interaction system that extends IAIs faceted heterogeneous search interface with a persistent user modeling module."

        "abstract": "The proposed ocean thermal energy harvesting approach is applicable to Slocum gliders, fixed-site power plants, and drifting or moored UUV charging stations. The temperature-induced buoyancy changes are driven by high-surface-area Shape Memory Alloy material that undergoes crystalline structure changes (Austinite - Martensite) when warmed or cooled by seawater. SMA produces useful linear strains of 5 to 8%. The strains can be directly used to create temperature-induced buoyancy changes by compressing and expanding a number of small spheres. SMA buoyancy engines have the potential to create a 19% buoyancy change over a 20 degree C temperature change when used in a closed thin spherical shell that is gas-precharged. Unlike a liquid-solid phase changes, the crystalline phase change contracts when heated and expands when cooled. As a result, the buoyancy changes are directly useful in ocean thermal energy harvesting. There is no need to pump a fluid in and out of a pressure vessel to get the temperature change in phase with the volume change. The high surface area per unit mass of thin shelled SMA spheres allows very high rates of heat transfer thereby dramatically improving the power output of a system that harvests ocean thermal energy."

Large electro-mechanical S&amp;A device used in rocket motor ignition systems have become one of the notable cost elements on current missile systems.  Developing and delivering considerably smaller, in-line, electronic S&amp;A devices can greatly improve system reliability and cost, and reduce space, weight and power (SWAP) for both legacy and forth-coming missile systems.  Tanner Research in conjunction with Teledyne  Electronic Safety Products (ESP), and supported by Raytheon RMS, proposes to micro-miniaturize a redundant dual-fire electronic Arm-Fire device as a paradigm for creating cost-effective initiation devices for ANY ordnance or energetic application.  The team plans to leverage their reliable TRL-7 EAFD\/through bulkhead initiator (TBI) architecture previously developed with insensitive exploding foil iniator (EFI) detonators specifically crafted for initiating and igniting insensitive energetics.  At the completion of the Phase II, this high voltage in-line ESAD\/EAFD will have reliable redundancy, built-in test (BIT) functionality and packaged as a through-bulkhead initiator.

        "abstract": "Ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems make use of carbon cloth - phenolic (CCP) resin composite materials, particularly as ablative insulators in the inlets and throats of rocket motor nozzles.  However, CCP exhibits aging through increased moisture content, arising from both water uptake in ambient air and endogenous water generation in the resin as it ages.  The presence of water in CCP leads to anomalous behavior during high temperature operation of the system, as the pressure exerted within the composite by the H2O gas can cause deleterious effects.  Carbon-carbon composites (C\/C) present an alternate material for use in rocket nozzle throats, but their improved performance and lack of aging effects are often overshadowed by their high cost and long lead times.  TDA is proposing a carbon fiber composite material that will be free from aging-related degradation, and provide performance that is intermediate between CCP and C\/C.  It will be more reliable than CCP, and have lower cost and shorter lead times than C\/C.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

The enabling technology is OPCs interferometric faint object tracker (iFOT), which offers unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity.  OPC envisions building a custom iFOT and integrating it with a pulsed laser source to form a complete sensor system for acquisition, tracking and pointing (ATP).  The common inertial reference approach described in detail in the proposal enables substantial power savings for the illuminator laser source.  The Phase I effort will start with a trade study of the sensor configuration, mounting options, and the illuminating pulsed laser source.  This will be followed by modeling and analysis, including analysis of previous acquired iFOT and other tracker data to validate the performance expectations.  Finally OPC will formulate a preliminary design and test and characterization plan for the Phase II prototype and conclude the Phase I effort with a Preliminary Design Review.

        "abstract": "Plasma Processes non-eroding throat liner technology for aluminized propellants has been significantly matured since 1999. An upcoming full-scale test will demonstrate that the technology is sufficient for transition consideration. However, there remain gaps in the technology that must be addressed prior to transition. The objective of this effort is to address these obstacles in order to expedite technology adoption by a prime and\/or con-sideration for an Engineering and Manufacturing Development program. Specifically, the Phase I will involve initial thermo-structural analysis to qualify baseline throat liner designs for an unclassified\/sanitized upper stage solid rocket motor environment. This design activity will also in-clude a mass reduction study that will focus on balancing manufacturability, structural integrity during handling and operation, and lowest possible mass of the tungsten based throat liner. The Phase I will also focus on defining a specific manufacturing plan for down-selected upper stage solid rocket motor throat liner designs. The Phase I will conclude with preliminary manufacturing trials of baseline and reduced mass throat liner designs. A Phase II will concentrate on optimizing the manufacturing process defined in Phase I; improving manufacturing attrition rate; maturing the mechanical property database; detailed analysis of an actual upper stage solid rocket motor environment using a higher fidelity property database; and r hot fire testing in a relevant upper stage solid rocket motor environment.

        "abstract": "Under this SBIR effort, the DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC) team proposes an innovative solution to the issue of post-break-up missile fragment tracking and break-up characterization.  It will apply to the case where the in-flight missile break-up event is not directly observed.  The objective is to track fragments and to determine as much information as possible regarding the nature of the event.  The product of this SBIR will be able to estimate both the event time for an unobserved break-up as well as the differential velocities imparted upon the missile fragments at break-up while taking into account continuing sensor measurements and error estimates.  The proposed approach builds on DACs experience in designing, implementing and delivering advanced decision aids to the DoD and intelligence communities, and will result in a tool suitable for eventual deployment.

Tools have a composite-compatible Coefficient of Thermal Expansion  (CTE), provide tight tolerances, are free-standing, and are of affordable cost.  For BMDS applications Green-AeroSM offers both improved performance and cost improvements estimated at about 25% over sand mandrels. With development, it will offer enabling technologythe most affordable solution for high temperatures and the only solution for very-high-temperature washout mandrels.  For the upper stage rocket motor of a land-based Aegis missile it will permit higher-temperature designs offering weight reductions in both internal insulation and external thermal protectionwithout tooling redesign and at reduced cost.  It will also be applicable to other BMDS boosters.   Our current process, however, has not been adapted to the particular requirements of BMDS propulsion systems. It is shop-scale and touch-labor intensive. The goal in Phase I is to advance the current TRL of 3 for BMDS applications to 4-5 in Phase I, and to a TRL of 6-7 in Phase II, when it will be transferred to propulsion contractors.

        "abstract": "Lightning protection is crucial for atmospheric flight of any missile vehicle.  The direct and indirect effects of lightning can easily cause catastrophic failure of a missile due to structural breach, fuel vapor ignition, damage to electronics, etc.  While the indirect effects of lightning must still be addressed, with aluminum skin, if it is of sufficient thickness, the electrical energy will be dissipated through the skin with only minor, local effects.  This is the means by which metallic skinned aircraft handle the initial lightning attachment and it has proven itself over thousands of documented lightning strikes on commercial aircraft.  Composite materials are not nearly as efficient electrical conductors as aluminum and therefore are more susceptible to damage from the high currents applied during a lightning strike.  Relying on the skin alone to dissipate the energy is not sufficient.  Therefore, lightning protection must be incorporated into any composite skinned vehicle that will be operated in all weather conditions.  Materials Research &amp; Design, Inc. (MR&amp;D) is proposing to investigate at least four different approaches for incorporating lightning strike mitigation within the TPS.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

        "abstract": "The unique electronic properties of periodically-arranged indium arsenide\/gallium antimonide (InAs\/GaSb) mesas in the type-II strained layer superlattices (SLS) make them a superior alternative to the conventional HgCdTe sensors for longwave infrared focal plane array (LWIR FPA) detectors.  However, despite the highly promising quantum features of SLS, its performance is currently limited by high reverse leakage current, attributed to the discontinuity in the periodic crystal structure caused by mesa delineation.  The Phase I efforts will address this challenge by applying a suitable passivation to the complex morphologies of type-II SLS mesas, in order to eliminate the dangling bonds from the surface and provide a robust barrier against the diffusion of chemical species, which could have deleterious effects on the device performance.  The proposed idea is built on the foundations of the novel chemical precursors that are proprietary to and available at RMD, Inc.  Using these precursors, a passivation technology with appropriate properties such as: band gap, thermal expansion, lattice, adhesion, and surface energy, will be developed.  The passivation technology will be optimized to yield uniform, conformal, pinhole-free and stoichiometric composition, processed at low substrate temperatures.

        "abstract": "The current BMDS M&amp;S database system was originally structured in an ad hoc  fashion.  The current system does not include metadata descriptions which makes comparison of events difficult, if not impossible.  The objective is to leverage modern Big Data architectures and develop an extensible database that can manage large data sets, exploit metadata, and support fast query speeds across the date database.  We explore moving from legacy data structures to a new integrated information-centric data structure based architecture, one that has the ability to seamlessly and securely transform legacy data into usable information, while managing cybersecurity and multilevel security concerns.  The solution moves beyond the ordering and querying of data in a structured manner onto operating on unstructured or loosely structured data via an emergent architectural approach.  This will allow the development of new designs quickly and foster positive innovation and design.  BBII proposes the creation of an integrated interoperable Information Model based information that will be the source and sink of data to support analysis, simulations, artifact generation, workflow and other operational needs.  In terms of security issues this approach includes use of Accumulo because of its fine level access control and because it addresses the needs of multi-level security while allowing the collapse of the network infrastructure to a single level.  This approach also addresses the Enterprise Architecture and lays the groundwork for developing the shell and integrating it with any existing Enterprise Architecture parts.

CEI proposes extending the existing NVIDIA nvcc preprocessor to optimize selection of computing resources based on profiler information generated by the application.  2. CEI would propose exploring Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) configurations that allow for low latency transfers between GPGPUs and GPFPGAs using the existing GPUDirect infrastructure.  3. CEI hypothesis is that it all performance depends on the application and needs extensive modeling and profiling to understanding.  These would be heuristics that could be integrated back into key benefit #1 with nvcc extensions.  4. CEI proposes to extend UCCS and CEIs work under STTR OSD11-T01 Autonomic Performance Assurance (APA) for Multi-Processor Supervisory Control to include variables for element power consumption.  5. Overall power will be reduce dramatically over CPU\/GPGPU based systems by 33% to 66% over CPU\/GPGPU systems.  6. In a 4U 19 rack mount chassis, a GPFPGA co-processor system with 160 to 200 TFLOPS system could be realized for only 1600W to 2000W and approximately 100 GFLOPS\/W which is 2X to 4X better than the state of the art GPGPU\/CPU system.

        "abstract": "Specialized computing hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs, can provide dramatically better performance than existing, CPU-based systems.  This specialized hardware is readily available in the commercial market and widely used in high-performance computing systems, making it easy to achieve high performance per watt and per dollar.  The major unsolved challenge in using specialized hardware efficiently in an HPC environment is effectively distributing computational work among multiple computing devices contained within a single hardware platform.  To address this issue, ATC-NY will develop DASH, a software platform for efficiently distributing computing tasks in an HPC environment among multiple specialized hardware devices.  DASH will enable HPC software to effectively utilize all available computational resources on a system, even heterogeneous collections of specialized hardware.  DASH provides an interface to hardware systems built from COTS components, enabling a single software application to obtain hardware-accelerated performance on many different nodes of a distributed computing system, even when individual nodes in the system have different hardware configurations.  This enables an end user to choose hardware configurations for individual nodes based on the operating environment and processing demands for that particular node.

        "abstract": "FCO is representative of a fuel fire scenario which is a clear danger to solid rocket motors during logistical and operational scenarios.  Fuel fires carry a high risk of inducing violent reactions which exceed the safety envelope of the munitions and cause significant collateral damage.  Current methods of alleviating this risk such as Thermally Initiated Venting Systems (TIVS) have had difficulties in attaining Type V reaction in large rocket motors greater than 12 inch diameter.  Any system which includes energetic material is required to pass the FCO testing to obtain IM qualification and reach operational status.  Innovative methods and technologies are needed for large rocket motors to help mitigate the hazards and pass the FCO test.  Corvids approach focuses on improving the TIVS concept by developing novel methods and technologies to alleviate the secondary effects and shortcomings which have prevented it from attaining Type V burn in an FCO environemnt.  Corvid will leverage high-fidelity computational modeling techniques and in-house high-performance supercomputing resources to develop and test TIVS concepts, design test prototypes, and evaluate test performance.  Based on outcome of the modeling efforts, prototypes will be developed and validation testing will be conducted.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

        "abstract": "In the presence of a fast cook-off event, the propellant within a rocket motor can ignite, leading to a propulsive reaction or catastrophic explosion.  To mitigate this risk, the Department of Defense (DoD) has Insensitive Munition (IM) requirements which are governed by MIL-STD-2105.  To pass fast cook-off (FCO) testing, MIL-STD-2105 requires interceptor systems to achieve a burning, non-propulsive response (type V).  Methods to vent or extinguish the propellant grain and pass this testing have been demonstrated with smaller motors.  However, these methods are not readily scalable to larger motors, such as those utilized on several Ballistic Missile Defense (BMDS) interceptors.  New technologies are required to enable the larger interceptor motors to meet the FCO requirements.  Luna Innovations Incorporated has expertise in both polymer chemistry and composite materials integration which has been successfully applied to both energetics and IM solutions.  Luna will build upon this experience to develop a passive venting solution consisting of composite material vents manufactured from a structural matrix resin that will rapidly disintegrate in the presence of extreme heat or flame.  The solution will be applicable to both composite and metal motor cases of all sizes and will be implementable in a number of different configurations.

The GRAMS provides protection to large missiles against direct lightning strikes by offering a unique solution that consists of novel layered and fused material that is highly electrically conductive, thermally insulating, extremely lightweight, and bonded to the existing missile skin.  GRAMS strips will either create a conductive path allowing lightning current to drain to the structural ground before launching or disperse the high current channels in the air after launch.  Testing with a simulated lightning strike will demonstrate mitigation of the direct effects of lightning strikes.  The flexible thin strips can be fabricated into various shapes and bonded to the surface of a missile skin or motor casing.  As a result, this technology offers missile survivability against direct lightning strikes, thermal effects, and debris.  In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of GRAMS by fabricating and testing samples.  In Phase II, POC plans develop a prototype consisting of protective sheets designed to fit the chosen missile platform.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

        "abstract": "While lightning protection has been applied to various small diameter composite missiles, large diameter composite missiles also require viable lightweight solutions for minimizing or eliminating direct lightning strike effects without significantly reducing battle space performance.  For purposes of this proposal, our team will focus on the development of lightning strike protection surface skins (or appliques) fabricated from flexible, lightweight high temperature films, fabrics, metallic foils and adhesives.  The proposed Lightning Strike Protective Applique (LSPA) system will be based on Arc-Root Dispersion technology and be readily adaptable to composite [e.g., Carbon Fiber Composite  (CFC)], outer structures of relevant missile platforms with special focus on application to the composite motor case housings of the missile structure.

        "abstract": "Interceptors require lighter weight upper stage rocket motor and Attitude Control System (ACS) components to achieve performance goals for next generation interceptors.  Lower density, higher temperature internal insulation materials will reduce weight in the interceptor rocket motor, homing and control propulsion and ACS components.  In ongoing programs, SDC is developing a composite insulated pressure accumulator (PA) for interceptors.  The composite overwrap has proven to be lighter weight compared to a metal design; however, the insulation inside the composite PA accounts for a large percentage of the PA weight.  Improvements in rocket motor mass fraction of next generation boosters can be realized by reducing mass of inert components. In order to reduce inert mass, SDC is already utilizing improved higher temperature resin systems and highly repeatable manufacturing processes to develop a lightweight interceptor large diameter rocket motor case (RMC).  To address lightweight interceptor propulsion pressure vessels and further reduce inert mass, SDC is proposing a Phase I SBIR program to reduce weight of insulated composite PAs and RMCs through the following innovations: non-traditional insulations with higher temperature capabilities compared to traditional internal insulations; insulation sizing through thermal analysis; manufacturability and insulation integration; and hot gas testing to quantify insulation capabilities.

The proposed design is beneficial for controlling carrier conduction to minimize the number of majority and minority carriers flowing from the contacts into the absorber without relying on minority carrier diffusion length limitations alone.  The reduction in the numbers of minority and majority carriers entering the absorber region is necessary to reduce thermal generation-recombination processes facilitated by high carrier concentrations; this is particularly relevant for LWIR detectors which are more susceptible to performance degradation due to high thermal noise.  This proposed effort will focus on three primary tasks: 1) carry out simulations of LWIR HgCdTe HTB device architectures, 2) fabricate and characterize single element LWIR HgCdTe HTB photodetectors with spectral response out to 12 m at temperatures above 70 K based on epitaxially-grown HgCdTe heterostructures, and 3) should this effort progress to Phase II, then HTB LWIR HgCdTe focal plane arrays will be fabricated in a 640 x 512 format.

Case venting is recommended so that in a fire, pressure is unable to build to a critical point.  Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) and a commercial partner propose to integrate an existing thermoplastic toughening agent containing core-shell nanothermite into a composite rocket motor case as a FCO mitigation system.  The solution will spontaneously vent the propellant in an entire rocket motor case in the event of a propellant fire making it applicable for both small and large diameter motors. The concept leverages CRGs extensive advanced composite manufacturing expertise, scalable nanocomposite fabrication technology, and Insensitive Munition (IM) mitigation experience as well as the commercial partners experience as a major energetic material and system manufacturer.  The resulting system will offer a scalable solution for FCO mitigation that can be used with a variety of composite manufacturing techniques.  No active sensing is required as the materials combust rapidly in fire while remaining insensitive in normal storage, handling, and use conditions.  The system will remain inert to aero heating.  Because the materials are also toughening agents, the case will not suffer weak spots or have parasitic weight penalties.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

        "abstract": "Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Parallel Adaptive Modeling and Simulation Through Intelligent Execution (PAMSIE) system.  PAMSIE is a portable, scalable, and modular computing block designed for real-time modeling and simulation.  It uses a heterogeneous computing architecture comprising homogeneous computing blocks consisting of FPGAs, DSPs, CPUs, and GPUs to perform bulk processing, thereby maximizing computational performance while minimizing infrastructure complexity.  The innovation in the PAMSIE architecture consists of a novel resource allocator, along with new communication methods, which significantly reduces distribution overhead to improve system efficiency.  Furthermore, it uses newer processor designs, fabricated by the 3-D, 22nm technology, resulting in higher performance per watt over existing portable systems such as the Cray CX1.  It uses COTS components, thereby inheriting economy of scale price reductions as well as reducing developmental risks.  In Phase I, POC will produce a conceptual design for PAMSIE along with a limited-scale prototype.  In Phase II, we will design and build a prototype and test it by loading unclassified software.  POC plans to deliver in Phase III two or more builds that interoperate to execute high level simulations.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

The innovation in heuristics, as well as accurate modeling and classification, will enable the system to create streamlined models of complex simulations and then to judge the quality of those models in terms of both accuracy and their performance.  In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the HEUCOSS system by fully developing the prototype software, demonstrating its accuracy against known reference simulation data, and benchmarking its computational performance.

        "abstract": "The objective of this effort is to improve first principles physics based models for predicting post-intercept debris at late-times.  Current techniques terminate the debris scene at a very short time after intercept due to high computational costs of physics based models.  Simple ballistic propagation is applied to the debris, which can lead to inaccuracies because of late-time deformation or component interaction.  Corvid proposes to utilize the recently implemented implicit solver in its in-house hydro-structural code, Velodyne, to improve late-time debris predictions.  The implicit solver will capture the late-time lower rate dynamics after the explicit solver models the high rate shock events.  Numerical timesteps of the implicit formulation are three times larger than the explicit, so coupling these solvers will optimize accuracy and runtime efficiency.  This will lead to better sensor characterization of post-intercept debris scenes for ballistic missile system design and testing.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

It is important to be able to test and evaluate the developed capabilities and technologies within a simulation environment that can verify the capabilities presented, test the functional limits of those capabilities, and provide meaningful comparisons with alternative approaches.  The proposed solution approach addresses three key objectives: 1) the identification of key model data and algorithm support modules within the simulation framework; 2) the design of selected algorithm support modules for a demonstration of framework functionality and common performance metrics; 3) the software architecture and framework to implement algorithm support modules, external interfaces for vendor plug-n-play component integration, and analysis displays.  The goal of the proposed solution is to provide an open-source, plug-n-play, simulation framework for early stage radar development.  The key objective is to provide a framework that will allow various radar algorithms to be evaluated side-by-side, or in connection with one another, in order to evaluate baseline performance, comparative analyses, and other performance assessments early in the algorithm development stages.

The sensor will be comprised of an MTJ sensing element that, when placed in a component or system, will monitor for perturbations in the ambient RF field profile during various stages of operation.  The configured sensor is environmentally robust and is sensitive to the field direction.  This project will also develop a low power complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) concept to provide digital readout of the measured signal with post processing to look for perturbations to be done off-chip.  The results of this effort will provide a concise path forward for the fabrication of prototype sensors in the Phase II program.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

        "abstract": "Legacy database systems often exhibit the feature of being stove piped and difficult to integrate over time.  This is because they were often developed for ad hoc purposes for specific groups, thus their data models and inherent structure is not always well understood except by a select few people who designed and built the database.  This means data retrieval using these legacy systems is a challenge, particularly when the system users are not intimate with specific domains, but are attempting to integrate information across several domains to answer difficult questions.  The problem is exacerbated when the data sources become extremely large (terabyte and larger).  Modus Operandi proposes the BMDS Analytic Semantic System (BASS) to assist simulation engineers and data analysts with advanced integration and analysis of data across disparate databases.  BASS utilizes scalable cloud-based semantics that provide a complex metadata model (as a set of layered ontologies) that can exist above the legacy data systems and provide a sophisticated means for querying against numerous databases from a single user end point.

We will establish a flexible environment to appropriately combine modeling fidelity and\/or resolution with simulation run time (or large run counts) allowing for assessments and sensitivity trades of the broader BMDS performance space for Tier  1 type products.  We will concentrate on the technical merit, feasibility, and trade studies of the SSS framework to optimally satisfy defined capability requirements.  The software management approach, simulation architecture, software\/hardware platforms and technologies, modeling fidelity approaches, interface content and format, post-processing, and analysis techniques are areas to be traded\/investigated.  Key areas of focus will be methods of abstraction of high fidelity models along with identification and mitigation of technical risks.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

        "abstract": "Absorber layers based on Type-II superlattices (T2SLs) composed of III-V compound semiconductors (e.g. GaSb and InAs) are a promising sensor technology for infrared imaging; however, dark currents and short carrier lifetimes in the Ga-containing T2SL are significant problems.  It is presently suspected that the short carrier lifetimes and some dark current arise due to a native point defect, possibly the Ga antisite (a Ga atom on the Sb sublattice), creating a mid-gap state within the T2SL band gap that facilitates Shockley-Read-Hall generation\/recombination.  We propose to use first principles calculations to verify the suspect defect and evaluate its impact on lifetimes and dark currents, and study its impact as a function of position within the superlattice period.  Other native defects will also be examined.  Molecular dynamics molecular beam epitaxy growth simulations will then be used to evaluate growth strategies that minimize the concentration of the key defects.  Experiments will then be performed to verify the theoretical understanding and optimize a growth process based on the theoretical predictions.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

The device utilizes an array of ultra-capacitors for energy storage in order to provide a local power buffer to isolate vehicle loads from interruptions of the main power bus.  In addition to energy storage, a set of electronics is included in the design to facilitate the integration of the energy storage devices with the existing power bus and vehicle load interfaces.  These electronics limit the maximum current drawn by both the Transient Protection Device and downstream loads, control the rise time of the power supply provided to downstream loads, and provide input and output filtering to ensure compatibility with vehicle  Electromagnetic Interference\/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI\/EMC) requirements.  In addition to the development of a design for the energy storage and interface electronics, a set of prototype hardware will be manufactured to support a test with a simulated power bus configuration to demonstrate the efficacy of the concept at mitigating an upstream disruption to a downstream load.

Presently, the output power in ytterbium fiber amplifiers is typically limited by stimulated Brillioun scattering (SBS).  By varying the seed source in the fiber amplifier either through phase or wavelength variation, the SBS can be significantly suppressed, allowing for significantly higher total output power from the laser system.  Since the VCSELs are wavelength tunable, they are easily extendable to create a multi-channel system, which can be spectrally combined for an overall higher system power.  Bandwidth10 has demonstrated wavelength-tunable lasers with wavelength tuning speeds in excess of 20 MHz, operating at 850 nm.  Under this program, the company proposes to redesign their high-speed wavelength tunable VCSEL to operate at 1060 nm, making it compatible with high power ytterbium (Yb) fiber amplifier technology.  The goal of this program is to deliver a low cost, low power, compact 1060 nm tunable VCSEL seed source with integrated phase\/wavelength modulation suitable for ultra high power laser systems.

        "abstract": "To address the U.S. Army need for a method to produce vitreous-enameled fibers for use in reinforced concrete, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Enamel Composite Applicator (ENCAP) coating technology. The proposed manufacturing technique is based on continuous processing of metal filaments, which results in the fabrication of porcelain-encapsulated fibers that form exceptionally strong bonds within the cement matrix and are compatible with a broad range of concrete formulations. The innovation in the ENCAP approach will enable our system to directly address the Armys requirement and allow quick production ramp-up, using common, commercially available precursor components. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of producing ENCAP-enhanced metal fibers on a small scale by building a benchtop prototype of the process line and fabricating and testing the performance of a single gauge type in one fiber material. In Phase II, POC plans to scale up the production equipment prototype and demonstrate the commercial feasibility of producing ENCAP fibers in bulk quantities, and to apply this technology to multiple fiber materials and gauges."

Devices must have a shelf life of 20+ years, provide peak power in a wide temperature range, endure high levels of linear acceleration and spin, and be ready for operation at a moments notice after decades of dormancy. To address this need, Solid Power, Inc. proposes to utilize a solid-state battery design to far exceed the energy densities achieved by state-of-the-art (SOTA) reserve batteries at a much lower cost, while offering energy density, safety, and shelf life that exceeds the best available Lithium Polymer batteries."

The indigenous materials of interest include: (i) reactive minerals such as biomass ash, natural pozzolans and lime for production of inorganic binders; (ii) natural fibers, fabric and rope for reinforcement of the inorganic binders and development of insulation layers; and (iii) traditional building materials such as adobe, stone and brick masonry, rammed earth and wood. These locally available materials will be formed into sandwich composite walls and roofs comprising (indigenous) ferrocement skins, and interior cores of traditional building materials (rammed earth, masonry, etc.) and\/or natural fiber insulation. Measures will be taken to ensure adequate shear transfer across the core for integrated composite action. The ferrocement reinforcement will be continued through joints to ensure integrated structural action. The Phase I project will develop a theoretical framework for design of building systems, conduct experiments on building subcomponents, components and joints to verify the theoretical predictions, assess the potential of the new building system to meet the targeted requirements at viable cost, and devise strategies for further development of the building system."

        "abstract": "The class of construction techniques grouped generally under the term adobe varies widely according to regional climates and cultures, soil properties and the use of technological enhancements such as reinforcing, concrete, plaster and chemical hardeners. The purpose of the work proposed here is to develop a tool for assembling an optimized, textile-based just-add-earth kit: pre-cut textile reinforcing are used as building templates, formwork and integral reinforcing. This facilitates fast, economical and structurally high-performing adobe buildings for base camp applications. To insure the best fit between local soil quality, climate, structural requirements and building form, we propose GIS and algorithmic decision tools to optimize each kit to its deployment location. These decision tools may also be applied to other indigenous construction types, allowing comparison to their respective efficacy in the field. The just-add-earth kit consists of fiber and textile elements, which replace conventional metal reinforcing. It applies advances in natural and synthetic fiber applications to adobe, lending it the predictability and performance of an engineered material."

The benefits of this project are to increase the effectiveness and utility of the Hellfire missile by increasing the range which is achieved through the reduction of the fly-away aerodynamic drag of the missile after launch. This reduction in drag is achieved by the conversion of the current shotgun connecter with a new low profile connector and adapter. The technical objective of this Phase I SBIR study is to select a design alternative to the existing Hellfire shotgun connector that will mate to any unmodified launch and will to maintain the existing shotgun missile to launcher mechanical and electrical interfaces while also mating to the Hellfire Guidance Section Housing. The existing shotgun connector on the Guidance Section Housing is a significant drag feature of the Hellfire missile. By selecting and incorporating a new low profile connector the Guidance Section Housing can be modified to reduce its profile that results in a fly-away configuration that has decreased aerodynamic drag. The adapter will be securely retained by launcher after the missile has been launched."

Both high and low temperature coating formulations will be evaluated. Several pounds of coated fibers will be produced in Phase I to show the potential benefits and scalability of the proprietary process. Concrete containing coated fibers will be compared with uncoated fibers to assess performance During Phase I, 3C Co will show the capability of coating various diameter and lengths of wire and fibers with repeatable and uniform thickness coatings. The unique process will clearly demonstrate fibers can be coated and fired in large quantities without sticking to one another. Production costs will be estimated in Phase I and a preliminary design of the manufacturing system will be completed in the Phase I Option.

        "abstract": "Aeroacoustic testing of rotors and propellers in wind tunnels fulfills an important role in the design and evaluation of future concepts as well as existing technologies. Laser-based sensors for standoff measurement of aeroacoustic perturbations are required in order to overcome the limitations of traditional microphones that are mounted on struts. AeroMancer Technologies proposes to develop a Laser Rayleigh Aeroacoustic Density Sensor (LRADS) for the measurement of acoustic density perturbations using Rayleigh scattering of laser radiation by air molecules. The relative acoustic density perturbations are directly proportional to the ratio of fluctuations of the intensity of the light received by the detector to the mean light intensity. While wind tunnel pressure and velocity measurements will be contaminated by periodic fluctuations from air turbulence, especially below 1KHz where acoustic measurements are desired, density measurements will not be affected as the turbulence is incompressible. In Phase I, AeroMancer will refine the instrument requirements and develop a simulation of its performance; build and test a breadboard instrument for validating the performance simulation; and develop the preliminary design of the system. AeroMancer will also study the potential for developing a miniature in situ version of the instrument for obtaining higher sensitivity and higher frequency response."

The approach is based on an existing active-passive focal plane array (FPA), which readily lends itself to this application. In Phase I, after working with U.S. Army stakeholders to refine the requirements and the controlled specification, a design trade study will be commenced and a day\/night Position and Time Spot (PATS) sensor architecture will be developed. To demonstrate proof-of-concept, the existing PATS sensor will be integrated with an InGaAs detector array and camera electronics, and shown to be capable of acquiring and identifying laser pulse streams at ranges longer than 2.4 km. Also, the ability to use the PATS for laser-beam stabilization will be demonstrated. The circuits for the updated PATS readout integrated circuit (ROIC) will be designed, and their performance simulated and prepared for fabrication in the Phase II program, in which the PATS imager will be fabricated, characterized, and field tested."

        "abstract": "Army infantry Commanders rely on autonomous systems to gain situational awareness about what is around the next building or over the next hill. However, in smaller Army units, the Commander has limited personnel to help plan out and manage these autonomous systems. Tasking autonomous systems requires that the Commander first task the system operators, who then have to translate that intent into low-level terms the autonomous systems understand. This process is error-prone and results in longer, slower information-to-decision loops for the Commander, which makes the unit as a whole less prepared and less agile on the battlefield. To make autonomous systems more useful and usable, SoarTech proposes to develop a Smart Interaction Device for Mission Command that will enable a Commander to interact directly with these autonomous systems, using natural, multi-modal interaction. This will reduce the cost to employ these systems and improve the Commanders situation awareness and decision-making. In this Phase I, we will leverage our existing tools and experience to research a multi-modal, human-computer interaction systems for mission command of autonomous systems. We will analyze current Commander interactions with staff and assess the feasibility of developing such an interface for mission command."

Determining whether a crash is exploitable however is a complex and multi-layered problem. GrammaTech proposes the Chase project, a tool suite for automatically triaging crashes reported in a program depending on the degree to which a crash appears indicative of an exploitable security vulnerability. In the long term, Chase will combine information about the crash itself, analyses to determine what data values are particularly important, computations of how much influence the attacker has over those important values (i.e., channel capacity), fault localization techniques, static analysis for proving unexploitability, taint analysis, automatic exploit generation, and domain-specific knowledge about exploitability. Chase will analyze a stripped binary in the context of a particular crashing input, compute or record the above information, and produce an estimate of the likelihood that the bug is exploitable. Users of Chase can use the results to help prioritize which crashes deserve particular attention."

        "abstract": "Degraded visual environment (DVE) presents a challenge for helicopter pilotage, particularly in close proximity to potential hazards such as vegetation, poles, wires, buildings, vehicles, personnel, equipment, nearby terrain, other aircraft, or ship superstructures. To safely negotiate these hazards, the aircrew must maintain a continuous awareness of the environment that can include both static and moving obstacles. In the absence of direct visual cues in DVE, the crew must rely on other means to determine the location and movement of these hazards. Here, we propose the use of active millimeter-wave (mmW) imaging to provide information about the helicopter surroundings in full 3D. The approach relies on the movement of the main rotor for the scanning, and on a distributed mmW receiver concept with optical up-conversion and processing for detection. The captured signal contains all information necessary to determine the position and movement of objects in the vicinity of the helicopter as well as the state of the rotor. In addition, high-gain transmission and reception for communication is afforded by the large effective aperture. The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to establish the viability of the approach and to identify optimum system architectures."

Current control schemes require a trained operator to remotely control an unmanned system in response to a Commanders orders. This added layer of indirection increases the complexity of the command structure, introducing latency and reducing situational awareness. Charles River Analytics proposes to develop a Supervisory HMI Enabling Practical Autonomous Robot Direction (SHEPARD). The proposed human-machine interface (HMI) consists of a portable software package and a modular hardware kit, including a camera and a lightweight, wearable operator control unit (OCU). SHEPARD fuses multiple proven robot control technologies to provide a natural and reliable hands-free HMI for soldiers operating in diverse environments. A key innovation of the proposed HMI is the development of a context-sensitive control module enabling natural, reliable control of multiple platforms by fusing multi-modal inputs (e.g., voice, gestures) with operational context."

The proposed Compact Multispectral Infrared Targeting System (C-MITS) builds upon Surface Optics real-time hyperspectral imaging activities, including our 3D full-motion video spectral imaging (FMV-SI) technology and our MIDIS hyperspectral image processor. Simultaneously sampling from 4 to 16 spectral bands from 1.5 um to 5.0 um over a full two-dimensional field, the system is ideal for identifying and tracking targets of interest to modern warfare, including those employing sophisticated camouflage techniques, whether active or passive. Through a series of data collects, trade studies, and preliminary design, the proposed program will develop and analyze an optimized design for an infrared full-motion video spectral imager appropriate for a targeting system on the Apache helicopter; the system will include a compact, rugged, real-time spectral imager plus the real-time hyperspectral (HS) data processor. The proposed effort represents an extension of Surface Optics 24 years experience in hyperspectral imager design, and miniaturization of SOCs patented real-time hyperspectral image processor for real-time hyperspectral discrimination. By building on Surface Optics Corporations experience in hyperspectral imaging system development, sensor development, and algorithm development, the proposed program will produce a new compact infrared multispectral imager of unsurpassed capability."

        "abstract": "Network protocols, such as link state routing and its variants, used in tactical mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) face serious problems of robustness and efficiency since the topological information becomes easily stale with fast network dynamics. Consequently, the emerging need to collect and exchange excessive network information increases the overhead and degrades the network performance. Social cognitive techniques that can provide tactical edges with situational awareness of the mission and supporting users are ultimately needed to sustain mission-critical network performance in the highly dynamic MANET environment. To address this critical need, we propose the following research and development efforts: (1) develop a probabilistic model for social and communication network interactions, (2) design robust, scalable, and efficient social and cognitive techniques to enhance tactical MANET communications and routing at the tactical edge, (3) implement the resulting network protocol on tactical radio platforms, and (4) demonstrate performance gains with respect to traditional network protocols in a wireless emulation testbed environment with real radios."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:XL Scientific proposes to design and build the Restoration Time Measurement System (RTMS) a portable test system for assessing recuperation time for a computer network disrupted via high power electromagnetic (HPEM) radiation. RTMS will be a combined hardware and software solution that includes a custom software application that directly interfaces specialized computer network components for control and monitoring. RTMS will have the ability to simulate upset or damage of system components, measure the downtime while an IT team identifies and remedies the problem, record the results in a database, and then provide support for data compilation and reporting. XL Scientific has considerable combined experience performing research into the theory of recuperation time modeling, and has implemented recuperation time models appropriate to engagement-level modeling. We therefore understand the bounds and applications of the problem, and can provide a tailored system that is flexible and maintainable to maximize data collection, future utility, and interoperability with related systems.BENEFIT:The dearth of recuperation time data has affected AF studies as well as those performed in other military branches, and its pervasive it affects susceptibility, vulnerability, and lethality studies, modeling and simulation at the engagement and mission levels, as well as exercises and planning, weaponeering, tradeoff studies, and optimization. Having a good estimate of system recuperation time is as important as bounding the target system probability of effect. The Restoration Time Measurement System (RTMS) will allow AFRL\/RDHE to collect recuperation time data much more easily, and in an automated and repeatable way, so that meaningful amounts of data can be collected each year. The system will also be flexible and maintainable so that it can be adapted to new PC and network hardware. Additional systems can be built to benefit other military branches in the same way. RTMS can also be used to study the impact of network partial functionality, such as in the cyber world to determine the impact of electronic attack or otherwise degraded communications. RTMS can also be used in the IT industry for training new staff, at least in identifying problem network components. Generally, RTMS will provide an overall better understanding of network operation or recuperation time for all of these applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Vigilant Cyber Systems, Inc. (VCS) proposes to design and develop a Toolkit for Assessing Electromagnetic (EM) Disruption Recovery (TAEMDR) to simulate EM disruptions in digital systems and accurately assess operator response to the disruptions. TAEMDR is designed to be intuitive to use allowing test engineers to build very complex models of digital systems of various complexities from simple single board embedded systems to complex systems of systems (e.g. command and control systems and enterprise management systems) by buildup models from sub models using a drag and drop graphical user interface. Once the model of the system under test is crated, TAEMDR provides intuitive interfaces to allow the test engineer to design and conduct the test to determine the bounds of response time, and provides tools for querying and viewing test results.BENEFIT:TAEMDR will include several significant innovations and enhancements to the current state-of-the-art. First, will be based upon a taxonomy of EM disruption effects and mechanisms to simulate those effects in the SUT without actually damaging the system. Second, the system will include drag-and-drop GUI based modeling to allow the creation of complex models from simple blocks. Third, the models and models will be store is an open XML format to allow for a community of users to share models minimizing duplication of effort. Fourth, TAEMDR will include automation tools to create test sets and automate the execution of tests to minimize test engineer time. These automation features will leverage the lessons learned from the DARPA research on the National Cyber Range. Fifth, the system will utilize Vigilants Query Manager and View Manager Architecture to allow for interactive query and viewing of test results, allowing test engineers to visualize the results in a manner that allows for better understanding of the overall test results and allows for program managers to use the results of the testing to make informed better decisions."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Lynntech is proposing a hybrid power system to provide the energy necessary for the directed energy pulsed applications of interest to the Air Force. The proposed system consists of a high power delivery component (battery) and a high energy density storage component (fuel cell) to meet the overall power and energy requirements. The conceptual system will deliver multiple bursts of 600kW 10 Second pulse discharges over the duration of the mission. The battery will provide the burst power necessary for the directed energy weapon, whereas the fuel cell will operate at a constant power in order to recharge the battery between firings (Figure 3). The battery will be sized to only have enough capacity to provide for one burst consisting of a certain number of power pulses with the ability to be recharged between firings by the fuel cell. This approach is specifically designed to maximize the amount of energy and hence the number of times the directed energy weapon can be fired during a given mission, thus extending the overall capability of present and future advanced weapons systems on-board UAVs.BENEFIT:The ability to provide prime power for pulse discharge energy applications is achieved without additional fuel consumption and enables increased weaponized mission endurance for systems with integrated directed energy weapons. This technology can more completely take advantage of the current UAV endurance capabilities (up to 43 hours with external tank) and provides a platform to provide continual active combat capabilities and tactical theatre defense. In addition to UAV, other airborne applications such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter can benefit from this effort by providing the ability to fulfill additional mission objectives without additional armament."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The development of advanced, scalable prime power systems is a key aspect of future weapon systems design and deployment. Directed Energy weapons systems typically require prime power inputs ranging from kilowatt to megawatt levels. The authors propose to design a scalable, hybrid fuel cell\/high power battery system that is capable of operating within a variety of airborne environments to replace conventional prime power systems such as turbine generators. The proposed design will provide a complete prime power system for a mission including self-contained fuel, power conditioning interface between the fuel cell and battery storage, and a compact state of the art thermal management system. The high peak power and energy requirements of many Directed Energy weapons systems are characteristics that match well with the capabilities of a hybrid system of high energy fuel cells and high power batteries. Fuel cell technologies are ideal to replace turbines and other conventional prime power systems for weapons systems because of the low environmental impact, minimal start up time, efficiency of converting primary fuel, such as H2 gas, directly into electricity, and scalable components to achieve a variety of prime power specifications.BENEFIT:The anticipated benefits for this SBIR include the development of innovative solutions for prime power systems for airborne weapons applications. Directed Energy systems have large intermittent pulsed load that is stressful on conventional prime power solutions. The Compact Hybrid Airborne Power System, CHAPS fills a need for the Air Force and the DoD in general. As more systems become all electric the demand for fuel cell\/battery hybrid systems will increase and CHAPS will meet the requirements."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Cyber operators mentally integrate numerous data sources, many whose native format is difficult to comprehend. Visualizations can help, but the raw data must first be transformed. Designing effective visualizations is also difficult because there is a dearth of empirical research on how various visualizations affect the cyber operators performance. Secure Decisions proposes to systematically research this problem starting with a knowledge elicitation of cyber operators to establish their information requirements and cognitive challenges, and developing visualizations to meet the operators needs. We have chosen to focus on alert triage\/escalation, vulnerability assessment and incident response tasks; and more specifically on the mission impact decisions that operators have to make when engaged in these tasks. Establishing the mission relevance of an alert or vulnerability, or assessing the mission impact of an incident response is a hard problem that is not currently automated. The USAF Cyber Vision specifically cites visualization of cyber impacts on missions as a near-term goal. It involves understanding complex dependencies between network entities, users and missions. Because semantic ontologies are excellent at representing complex relationships, we will use that as our data transformation approach. Finally, well design a Phase II experiment to objectively evaluate how visualizations affect operator performance.BENEFIT:The proposed work will make several contributions to the cyber defense domain: 1. A significant step forward in meeting the USAF Cyber Vision near-term goal of being able visualize cyber impacts on missions. 2. Deep insight into how cyber operators currently assess the mission relevance of alerts, vulnerabilities and incident responses and consider mission impact in their cyber defense decisions. This will include information about the analytical questions they ask, information needed to answer those questions, decision processes used, and data sources consulted. 3. Identification of cognitive challenges and other impediments to assessing mission relevance when performing alert triage\/escalation, vulnerability assessment, or selecting courses of action in incident response. 4. Prototype visualizations designed to help cyber operators gain awareness of the mission relevance of alerts, vulnerabilities and incident responses 5. Visualization of the complex dependencies between network devices, users and missions that can be applied to emerging Department of Defense programs in cyber mission assurance and mission impact analysis. 6. Enhanced understanding of how visualizations can be used by cyber operators to assess the mission impact of various cyber defense activities. It will shed light on the insights that cyber operators gain and the types of visual patterns they look for when answering questions such as: Which of the myriad of alerts are occurring on mission-critical devices Which of these vulnerabilities must be remediated before the mission can be assured What users and operational roles will be affected by closing this port or blocking this IP address 7. An assessment of the feasibility of using a semantic ontology as a data transformation method to represent complex relationships between network devices, users and missions. The feasibility study will identify changes required to improve its use with various visualizations and new data sources. 8. A fully described experimental design to be conducted in Phase II to assess the effectiveness of various visualizations on cyber defense activities."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Cyber operators face a deluge of data about complex networks and need to efficiently identify, analyze, and mitigate anomalies. They are overloaded with information, and are often faced with situations that require immediate action to mitigate network effects. While computational techniques such as filters and fusion algorithms can help, the dynamic nature of cyber operations means that data still requires human interpretation to determine the best course of action. To address these challenges the Aptima team proposes to design and build Advanced Displays for Visualizing Information in Cyber Environments (ADVICE). ADVICE uses context-aware interactive visualization, with computational awareness of context drives which visualizations are presented and what data is shown. These visualizations will be human-centered not only in the visual design, but also in the interactions. As cyber operators perform their tasks, ADVICE will provide an integrated context-sensitive picture by facilitating connections across different sources of data, and prioritizing that information based on the users tasks and interactions. The goal of ADVICE is to enable cyber operators to more efficiently perform their jobs by providing intuitive representations of data that are tailored to the operators needs.BENEFIT:ADVICE provides human-centered, context-aware visualization of data for cyber operators. Through computational awareness of context, visualizations are tailored to the task and needs of the human operator. As cyber operators perform their tasks, ADVICE will provide an integrated context-sensitive picture of network activity by facilitating connections across different sources of data, and prioritizing that information based on the users tasks and interactions. This will enable more effective cyberspace operations, where operators can focus their effort on their current task and fluidly interact with the data."

Existing sensor technology for head-mounted systems do not provide the same performance, especially in low light conditions, compared to the latest image intensification technology. However, existing image-intensifier-based NVGs are limited by their size, weight, and cost of the image intensifier tube. This approach also provides imaging of a limited spectral range. Cyan Systems, an innovator in advanced imaging sensor technology, has a wealth of experience in producing cutting edge readout integrated circuits (ROIC), a critical hardware component of many imaging systems. Based on proven technology, Cyan Systems proposes to develop a unique small pixel digital output ROIC that will be hybridized to a high performance visible-NIR-SWIR detector array using advanced small pixel interconnect technology resulting in an ultrahigh definition (UHD) focal plane array (FPA) with superior low noise performance, even at very low light levels, compared to the latest image intensification technology. The digital output FPA will enable multiple system enhancements such as symbology overlay and image processing in a compact camera system that will provide a broader spectral response compared to existing image intensifier tube technology.BENEFIT:The unique small pixel, high sensitivity solid state night vision sensor will permit high resolution, low light level imaging performance for a new generation of head-mounted digital night-vision technology."

TRACS includes four principal components: (1) passive high-resolution cameras, placement and number of cameras to be specified in Phase I; (2) a feature extractor which uses fast-executing image registration and object location\/tracking image processing algorithm techniques; (3) a feature selector and integrator whose image processing algorithms pre-process the raw position data to reduce, integrate, and select features from the multiple cameras for optimal accuracy and speed; and (4) a helmet state calculator which produces and tracks the full, six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) helmet position state in three-dimensional (3-D) space coordinates. The TDKC team is well-qualified to perform this research due to our related experience, success with similar developments, and proven expertise with sensing, video\/image processing, and real-time computing technologies. During Phase I, we will build, test, and demonstrate a TRACS Feasibility Testbedan early functional prototype to experimentally and analytically assess feasibility and to verify and demonstrate our feasibility conclusions to the Air Force.BENEFIT:TRACS integrates these innovative image processing technologies to provide accurate 6-DOF helmet tracking at real-time speed, using TDKCs existing and proven video-speed image registration technique, the Simple Topographical Area Registration Engine or STARE. TRACS provides this helmet tracking in a small-volume, transportable package with minimal setup or calibration requirements, and autonomous operation. TRACS offers cost-effective and accurate passive helmet tracking advantages to numerous government or military organizations that need to track helmet (or other object) dynamic 6-DOF state in real-time with high accuracy. Commercial applications are significant, predominantly in the gaming and security domains, as well as a lower-cost, higher-speed alternative to tracking or characterizing object motion in general, which may occur in reconnaissance, surveillance, or other missions."

New display technology integrated into the pilots helmet enables effective situational awareness through virtual displays and applied overlays. However, such displays require accurate and low-latency helmet orientation measurements. Systems which are easily adaptable to various helmets and aircraft are essential for broad military use. The Adsys Controls Cockpit Passive Optical Helmet Tracker (CPOHT) does not involve any substantial modifications to the helmet, or mounting of any additional electronic components and sensors, and can be used with any helmet on the market. CPOHT passive tags applied to the helmet and cameras mounted in the cockpit. The proposed system addresses such challenges as image ambiguity (data association), cockpit mounting and environment constraints (camera locations, choice of lens, tag locations on the helmet, etc.), and system calibration. Our approach provides disambiguation which enables unique and reliable identification of the helmet mounted tags. Image processing will be performed leveraging our existing video processing capabilities allowing for low-latency computation with minimal system impact to the aircraft.BENEFIT:The CPOHT system will provide a low-cost solution for a broad range of vehicles, helmets and mission sets enabling next generation cockpit situational displays. In addition to military applications, the proposed technology can be utilized in commercial and law enforcement applications (e.g. directing gimbaled video equipment line of sight, search spot light, general inexpensive HMD applications, such as Google Glass or Epson Moverio), augmented virtual reality (VR) systems including videogame and entertainment industry, training, architectural design, and medical applications. The technology can also be directly applied to a general object orientation tracking and be used in targeting systems and other similar applications requiring object attitude knowledge."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To address the Air Force need for a clip-on helmet-mounted digital panoramic night vision goggle (NVG) having cueing functionality, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Multi-Aperture Tiled In-line Sensor Digital Panoramic Night Vision Goggle (MATIS-DPNVG). The proposed NVG is based on a unique integration of POCs four key technologies: multi-spectral multi-aperture sensor based on compact reflective optics, multi-micro displays with extended dynamic-range light engine, optical tiling waveguide image router optics, and parallel pipe-line electronic processor. The innovation of the MATIS-DPNVG system integration will provide low size, weight and power (SWaP), wide FOV (120 deg(H)  50 deg(V)), and high dynamic range imagery over day and night conditions. By providing a 1:1 sensor\/display imagery in real time in a common line-of-sight, the device will provide cueing capability and symbology overlay of on-board sensors and data. In Phase I, POC will develop the design of MATIS-DPNVG with acceptable mass properties that integrates cueing and day\/night vision, with fusion of on\/off helmet data and video inputs, and demonstrate the design through a laboratory breadboard system. In Phase II, POC will fabricate, test against current analog in-line NVG, demonstrate, and deliver a MATIS-DPNVG prototype to the Air Force.BENEFIT:The proposed MATIS-DPNVG system will have revolutionary new capability of night, all-conditions day\/night viewability, with an extremely light and low-profile clip-on HMD, that will replace the current I^2T-based military standard night vision goggles (NVGs). By providing these new capability the MATIS-DPNVG can help give U.S. military forces a renewed advantage and capabilities including panoramic wide field-of-view, on\/off helmet data and video input fusion, image recording, processing and communication to\/from helmet system. It also can become an integral component in commercial and security surveillance systems where wearable night vision technologies are currently used, including civilian law enforcement, commercial vehicle operator, first responders, forest and urban firefighters, border patrol, and security personnel."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The objective of this Phase 1 effort is to assess the feasibility of a Binocular, Wide field of view Digital Goggle named the BiWiDG, with day\/night imaging capability. The BiWiDG is based on a binocular, partially overlapped central field of view using Intevacs 4Mp (megapixel) ISIE4000 EBAPS (electron-bombarded active pixel sensor) and its IROC (interline reflective optical collimator) eyepiece to achieve fields of view (FoV) beyond todays binocular analog NVG, with optimum and low light acuity suitable for aviation and ground applications. The BiWiDG will include fusion of imported digital imagery \/ information and video export capability, as well as use a new design concept for day use. This Phase 1 feasibility study will perform trade analyses between two similar design options against low light acuity, central FoV overlap size, frame rate, size\/weight\/power\/cost, and diagonal field of view to yield an optimized design for Phase 2 consideration. It is expected that the proposed Phase 2 design shall be implemented and a working prototype BiWiDG shall be produced and delivered in Phase 2BENEFIT:There is a recurring need for a wide field of view, cost-effective night vision goggle (NVG) with acuity equivalent to todays fielded analog goggle technology. Analog NVG technology has limited utility during day operation and cannot optimally fuse external imagery and information. A binocular, wide field of view digital goggle which can operate during day as well as night and fuse input information and export sensor video with night performance equivalent to todays analog NVG offers a new capability for both the aviator and dismounted Air Force warrior."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP) and Joint Terminal Air Controller (JTAC) deploy with not only a significant amount of gear, but also a large work load in order to manage all of their responsibilities. As the battlefield becomes more digitized, it is forcing TACPs\/JTACs (which we will refer to as just TACPs for brevity in the document) to deal with more information than their current systems can provide in a way that not only enables high situational awareness (SA), but lends to quick decision making in the heat of a battle. Several programs, both run by the government and private industry, have begun to look at the problem in a new light with efforts, such as Persistent Close Air Support (PCAS), UltraVIS, and Rosetta Joint Fires. However, there is still a large opportunity to improve the TACPs abilities. TACPs are still left hunched over computer displays attached to their chest, looking through subpar performance, and\/or using bulky near-to-eye displays with low resolution. The Creative Microsystems Corp (CMC) team, proposes to create a new display architecture using a human factors (HF) framework approach to assess the current TACP ensemble and requirements to derive a new information display configuration that improves ergonomics, minimizes short and long term physiological effects (eye strain, radiation bioeffects, etc.), and reduces overall size, weight, and power (SWaP). Once CMC determines the optimized display information aggregation and design, we will then leverage best of breed display technology, whether CMCs own technology being used for next generation night vision and pilotage, or other technology that is available on the market to develop a new display design philosophy. Finally, CMC will demonstrate key pieces of hardware to provide a strong foundation for Phase II activities. BENEFIT:The development of the wearable technology associated with this effort strongly positions CMC for an incredible opportunity to enter into numerous markets based on the flexibility and capabilities of the system. The technologies developed under this program will have a wide market appeal in both defense and commercial areas. CMC is currently exploring numerous markets, including near to eye displays for civilian firefighters, civilian SCUBA divers, Navy Damage Controlmen, Navy Salvage Divers, and aircraft pilots. The Human Factors method will be documented in such a way that the studies will be readily repeatable, lending to quick outcomes for other positions that require enhanced situational awareness displays."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Being a member of a Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) is one of the most challenging positions in the military. These personnel are tasked with the dual roles of being warfighters as well as air traffic controllers, often while near or behind enemy lines. Especially because of this dual role, TACP members must maintain a very high situational awareness. Looking down at a wrist or chest worn display, even for a few seconds, can mean the difference between detecting an enemy or target and missing them. An optimized information display could increase the effectiveness of TACP members, allowing them to remain eyes out all the time. At night, if such a display could fit in between their night vision goggles and their eyes, it would allow for symbology augmentation on top of night vision imagery. SA Photonics has developed the concept for the TACPOD (TACP Optimized Display) to provide TACP members with increased situational awareness in day and night operations. This system will be used to compare against a body worn display, and, if it proves favorable it will be built in a Phase II effort. BENEFIT:The benefits of SA Photonics TACPOD display include:  Wide field of view, high resolution TRL 7 eyepiece  Variable transmittance eyepiece for use in high ambient environments and to control light leakage at night  Ability to use night vision goggles (NVGs) and combine imagery with symbology  Intuitive fore\/aft, vertical and interpupillary distance (IPD) adjustments  Overlay of my information while viewing other members information in a tactical operations center environment  Stowable out of the direct line of sight when it isnt being used  Wireless operation removing the need for a cable between the HMD and controller"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To address the Air Force need for F-35 cockpit display improvements, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop the new Revolutionary Avionics Display (RAD) system, based on the integration of a touch-integrated high resolution ruggedized LCD, quantum dot (QD) enhanced and NVIS-compatible backlight, video acquisition and upscaling processor, and ruggedized packaging. The innovative integration and modification of state-of-the-art technologies to meet the Air Force requirements, based on unique POC capability and experience in avionics display, will lead to an epochal shift in cockpit display technologies. In Phase I, POC plans to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by designing and developing a system architecture that meets the F-35 form-factor while incorporating display technology improvements, touch\/gesture controls, and optimizes SWaP and thermal performance. Pilot effectiveness improvements will be considered through internal testing and feedback from end-users. A roadmap for feature introduction will be refined along with a formal transition plan with life-cycle cost analysis. In Phase II, POC will fabricate and test a prototype system and assess production readiness, supply chain reliability, and update our transition plan leading directly to Phase III production of the RAD system, as well as development of a detailed Air Force human systems integration plan.BENEFIT:The RAD technology can be adapted to commercial aviation displays and medical display applications where typically the display performance is critical and extends beyond standard consumer display performance requirements. The RAD technology can be incorporated into industrial display systems for factories and aerospace displays systems for space explorations missions including spaceship cockpit displays and vehicle displays. Military applications of the RAD system will include: upgrades to legacy avionics displays and ground vehicle displays. The technology may progress to personal displays used by solders including kneeboard\/chest display systems or head-worn displays. The RAD technology can be incorporated by the DoD into all the F-35 and V-22 variants for each branch and be adopted by the Navy for ship and submersible displays to provide enhanced sensor data information content in the form of larger color gamut and higher resolution. Additionally, pilots for unmanned vehicles can utilize the displays to monitor live feeds from EO\/IR sensors that typically contain higher resolutions and bit-depth than what the existing displays can reproduce."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:There have been many touchscreen and display technology improvements since the F-35 8 x 20 MFD was first introduced.  Optically enhanceded resistive touchscreens (OERTs) have been developed specifically to address the human factor demands within the cockpit. This type touchscreen requires a purposeful touch to activate, thereby eliminating light or non-contact accidental activation. An OERTs is also not based on light beam interruption, and therefore will be compatible with advanced imaging system technologies that detect light beyond the NIR band. OERT will further enable touch input redundancy if necessary. AMLCD technology exists today that far exceeds 128 PPI of the original F-35 MFD. Displays in pixel density over 180 PPI are available in commercial formats. Long battery life forced display providers to maintain very high display efficiencies despite increased pixel density. The new high PPI technology combined with ever increasing high efficacy LED light sources enable much higher luminance without thermal overrun. The need to show fast moving objects in sports and entertainment has delivered the technology that provides faster refresh rates through improved optics, materials and digital processing. TPIs excellent background in high performing touchscreens, along with Esterlines strong background with avionics displays provide AFRL a formidable development team. BENEFIT:We strongly believe that our proposal will enable substantial improvements in display and touchscreen performance compared to current generation F-35 8x20 MFD. These improvements will include touch integrity, higher display refresh rate, improved LCD resolution, and brightness, reduced power\/thermal demand, and lower weight."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The proposed effort will begin connecting military jet noise source and field properties with waveform and spectral features that correlate with human perception and annoyance. Tactical military aircraft noise evokes significant community response relative to ordinary transportation noise because of its high amplitudes and unique features, such as significant shock content and low-frequency rumble. During Phase I, metrics will be examined for ability to correlate physical noise characteristics, such as source distribution, radiation properties, directivity, and shock content, with human annoyance and disturbance. A comprehensive evaluation of existing tactical jet noise measurement databases will be conducted to determine their suitability for Phase-II listener studies based on candidate metrics. The listener test experimental design, training protocols, and reviews will be completed. Experimental design for any additional required acoustical measurements will also be developed. To guide source characterization efforts and improve ability to extract significant noise features, a cost\/benefit analysis of acoustical holography and beamforming will be conducted with full-scale data. These technical tasks will lay the foundation for quantifying source and field features that impact human perception in Phase II. The results will improve prediction of community noise impacts and guide future noise models, data collection, and noise mitigation efforts.BENEFIT:The teams combined experience in the areas of aircraft noise measurements, noise model development, and environmental impact determination associated with operations of military aircraft demonstrate a unique ability to assess the market need for this research and its utility and benefits to the community at large. In addition to a continuous effort to publish new and relevant research, active participation in multiple conferences each year, and numerous connections to both government and commercial clients provide us with the ability to increase awareness of this technology and market through a multitude of avenues. With the beddown of the next-generation of fighter jets such as the F 35, the demand for improved metrics that correlate jet noise exposure to human response and the desire for increased understanding of jet noise source characterization is only expected to increase,. The specialized jet noise metrics developed under this effort will attempt to represent the psychoacoustic response to high-power jet noise, which will improve in the evaluation of community impacts. Evaluating potential environmental impacts, including noise, is required by the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) for proposed actions, such as the beddown of the F-35. The environmental impact from aircraft are currently evaluated by the DOD, FAA, and other federal agencies using models such as NOISEMAP and AEDT, which output traditional noise metrics. Through the development of these specialized metrics, identification of the temporal and spectral jet noise characteristics associated with human response will inform requirements to improve and refine the sound propagation models used to evaluate community impacts. These advancements will lead to a deeper understanding of the community responds to jet noise and will improve the overall environment assessment of community noise exposures from tactical jet operations. These improved tools will translate into better relationships between the airfield and neighboring communities. Additionally, these specialized metrics are anticipated to play a crucial role in rocket noise impact evaluation from the emerging spaceport industry, regulated by FAA\/AST, NASA, and the Air Force. Improved jet noise source characterization and a deeper understanding of jet noise generation mechanisms will inform future aircraft noise measurements. A high-fidelity representation of the noise sources will provide better inputs to environmental noise models, mission planning tools, and research tools than currently available. The acoustic source definitions, refined under this effort, will be used to improve predictions of ground personnel noise exposure, evaluate the performance of proposed noise control devices, and provide model refinement and benchmarking."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Noise levels of military jet aircraft have significantly increased as the power of the engines has increased creating a community noise issue around military airfields. Current noise monitoring requirements only measure sound pressure levels which do not correlate to human annoyance \/ disturbance. Sound Answers plans to apply their extensive Sound Quality background to establish new acoustic time- and frequency-based metrics which will correlate to human perception for annoyance\/disturbance. Then, Sound Answers staff will apply their Noise &amp; Vibration troubleshooting methods to evaluate various acoustic array technologies to identify the most efficient \/ cost effective method for cascading the new annoyance metric results to actual design features of the jet engine in an effort to reduce the annoyance levels of the new aircraft. The final deliverable will be a Matlab-based toolbox integrated into Sound Answers Time Frequency Analyzer Core (TFAC) software and will also be embedded in current commercial software packages used for acoustic monitoring at airports.BENEFIT:- Civil and Military Aircraft manufacturers, who can specify noise requirements to engine manufacturers in light of annoyance in the far-field. - Jet engine manufacturers, who can implement better near-field noise test procedures to validate their product, increase their noise diagnostic capabilities and be more effective in identifying areas of noise reduction - Government agencies, in the US and abroad, who can apply the new annoyance\/disturbance metrics to improve the power of their Community Noise Impact tools."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Although two- and three-dimensional cellular constructs are utilized regularly in in vitro toxicology studies, they possess significant limitations when compared to actual physiological states of cells and tissues in vivo. Microfluidic organ-on-a-chip systems offer a distinct advantage of these existing in vitro systems through incorporation of micro-architecture to a cultured cell line(s) that structurely and mechanically mimic more closely in vivo physiological conditions in an in vitro construct. There is still a significant need to refine organ-on-a-chip systems to more closely simulate physiological conditions and improve microfluidic substrates to prevent unwanted absorption of test matrices (solvents, aerosols, etc.). Lynntech proposes to develop a next generation organ mimic system that utilizes a chemically resistant substrate for generation of improved microfluidic features to more closely mimic physiological conditions experienced by cultured cells. In the SBIR Phase I, Lynntech will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed microfluidic substrate and architecture to improve an example organ mimic system. In the SBIR Phase II, Lynntech will refine the proposed system and evaluate biological response of the system to an array of aerosolized volatiles, semivolatiles, and particulates.BENEFIT:The proposed technology is positioned for rapid transition to an existing Air Force Molecular Bioeffects development programs. The proposed technology provides technology to identify toxicity issues in current and future aircraft environments to improve the safety of the warfighter. The proposed research tool has significant non-military applications. The proposed microfluidic technology provides toxicology and pharmacological researchers with a research support tool to reduce costs and improve in vivo study outcomes of toxins, therapeutic agents, etc. through use of a low cost physiologically relevant in vitro cell model."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Makel Engineering, Inc. and the University of California at Davis propose to develop an Orthogonal Air Quality Sensor Suite (OAQSS) which combines single species solid state chemical sensors with a miniature ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) to monitor oxygen levels and a wide range of potential contaminants. In addition to chemical species, the OAQSS will include pressure, temperature and dew point measurements. Several solid state chemical sensors will be derived from previous research for fire detection and emissions monitoring (e.g., O2, CO2, CO, NOx, hydrocarbons). The miniature IMS technology will enable detection of a wide range of volatile organic compounds and other vapors, significantly expanding the capabilities of the solid state sensors. The OAQSS will be a flyable system capable of real-time monitoring of the species of interest. It will be suitable for integration with aircraft environmental control system, adhering to available power sources and data transfer protocols. The system will have internal logging capabilities keeping a data buffer sufficient to store data for one or more flights Consistent with flight requirements, the OAQSS will be robust to survive the acceleration and vibration environment expected in fighter planes, yet design will emphasize minimization of physical envelope, mass and power consumption. BENEFIT:An aircrafts OBOGS supplies proper oxygen partial pressure to the pilot by conditioning and concentrating oxygen from engine bleed air. In addition to concentrating the oxygen levels, this system effectively filters out contaminants from typical bleed air supply. Problems arise when bleed air composition is substantially out of spec with elevated levels of contaminants. Real-time monitoring and detection of contaminants via the proposed system can immediately alert the pilot and aircrew to dangers, and initiate timely execution of emergency procedures. As commercial and civil aviation transition from traditional high pressure gaseous and liquid oxygen systems to OBOGS, there will exist additional commercial opportunities for the proposed Orthogonal Air Quality Sensor Suite (OAQSS)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Texas Research Institute Austin Inc., with teaming partner Honeywell Analytic, proposes to develop and qualify a sensor system to track composition and contaminants in pilot breathing air in near real-time. TRI\/Austin will utilize its years of experience in design, utilization and fabrication of custom sensors and electronic circuitry to cost efficiently design an optimal system with minimized foot print and weight that fits within the constraints of high performance aircraft subject to varying pressure, temperature and humidity. Sensors and a functional prototype will be rigorously tested in our facilities for specificity, accuracy, precision, detection threshold, response-time, drift, robustness, reliability, cost, size and weight. The analytical laboratory of TRI Air Testing has almost 40 years of experience specializing in breathing air composition and detection and quantification of contaminants in compressed breathing air. Honeywell Analytic is a recognized industry leader in the development of sensors and breathing air monitoring systems and is currently developing sensor suites for commercial aviation. Phase II will focus on implementation of the sensor suite and electronics, with extensible library of detectable compounds, necessary for real-time tracking of air quality and organic and inorganic contaminants down to PPB ranges simultaneously in a form factor compatible with in-flight testing.BENEFIT:Development of an orthogonal sensor suite for use in flight will enable continuous assessment of pilot air quality and an early warning system for contaminant incursions. TRI\/Austins engineering team also sees this as an opportunity to providing a technical platform for further development of hand-held and fixed site air-quality monitors in indoor or outdoor environments from urban to rural settings. A sizable population of environmentally sensitized, severely allergic, and asthmatic individuals is present that need to cost effectively monitor their residential air quality and receive an alarm when conditions warrant. This, together with an aging population plagued by pulmonary disabilities such as COPD, supports a large accessible market for these air quality sensor suites. Similar systems could be readily utilized in hospitals, clinics, office buildings and industrial complexes, as well as on portable point-of-use oxygen generators. Extant technology is limited to monitoring individual, or otherwise too few, potentially hazardous contaminants. Thus, high unmet needs persist in a spectrum of accessible settings requiring sensor suites to monitor composition and alarm for contaminants in breathing air."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Despite ever-shrinking training budgets, military personnel must continue to develop and maintain proficiency to ensure success in increasingly complex operational environments. To achieve proficiency within these constraints, training methods and technologies must enable efficient and personalized learning. To do so, training approaches must track and asses competence and account for individual differences throughout the training development and delivery lifecycle. Aptima proposes to develop the Adaptive Module for Personalized Learning Environments (AMPLE), an adaptive training management module that plugs into training systems and learning management systems, and assesses individual competence, accounts for individual differences, and provides training recommendations enabling personalized training across training environments. To build such a system, Aptima will leverage existing documentation to understand the different training requirements across positions. AMPLE will integrate with existing performance measurement technologies to collect, consolidate, and store multi-sourced data and assessments, such as the individual learners competence, position, and previous learning experiences, and will apply adaptive algorithms to these data and assessments to provide intelligent, data-driven training recommendations. When fully implemented, AMPLE will enable training designers and instructors to maximize training resources by providing to individual learners personalized training that supports development and maintenance of competence.BENEFIT:AMPLE will be an adaptive training management module that plugs into candidate training systems and existing learning management systems, and provides personalized training recommendations based on the continuous assessment of an individuals competence, accounting for individual differences, and will do so within the context of an integrated training environment (i.e., a set of training systems). Specifically, AMPLE will enable training designers, instructors, and researchers to maximize training resources by providing intelligent, data-driven training recommendations and by allowing users to examine training questions related to specific training goals, such as minimizing skill decay, maximizing retention, or achieving broad coverage of training requirements across positions. This hybrid approach will allow users to understand the impacts of maximizing certain learning outcomes over others. While our primary focus is to address the needs of the Air Force training and training-research communities, the adaptive training management module and underlying approaches will be designed to be generalizable to address personalized training needs across other DoD agencies and commercial organizations. Our initial efforts will focus on the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination domain, which represents a complex mission involving a variety of roles, disciplines, and training needs. End users will benefit by receiving recommendations for personalizing training, understanding where learners are in the development of competence, and understanding how best to optimize future training within the constraints of available resources."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:We will design, prototype, and demonstrate the Unique Learning Trajectory (ULTRA) LMS. ULTRA will incorporate features from personalized medicine (PM). Two key PM features as applied to Air Force training are 1) a systems approach to capturing descriptors for each Airman and 2) big data analytics. Descriptors include person factors such as personality dispositions, gender, age, and interests. Descriptors also include situational factors such as the Airman&apos;s mission, recency and scores from past trainings, and the transfer environment. Big data analytics crunches through the resulting massive amounts of data to tease out nuances with regard to how to deliver the right training, at the right dosage, at the right time to each Airman. These analytics can also reveal data at the organizational level such as the optimal refresh rate for particular knowledge and skills within a career field. Moreover, ULTRA will provide hooks to enable any Air Force training system to adapt its instructional delivery on-the-fly for an Airman or group of Airmen. Finally, we describe innovations for increasing transfer. These innovations address research findings which suggest learning from formal training only accounts for as little as 10% of workplace learning. Most workplace learning takes place informally.BENEFIT:The benefits of this revolutionary approach to training are immense. They address a common complaint amongst trainees in the military, corporations, and higher education that formal training is not relevant to their individual needs. In contrast, our approach will demonstrate how personalized training leads to faster acquisition of job competency, longer retention, and faster refresh than anything possible today."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The feasibility of developing a photonics-based real-time high-power-microwave (HPM) near-field mapping system is to be investigated. The system is intended to contain multiple non-intrusive near-field sensors so that it can simultaneously detect undistorted versions of broadband HPM electric- and magnetic-field transients over a desired field-mapping area. The system will be able to take advantage of existing photonic and instrumentation technologies in order to have a measurement bandwidth that extends up to current-day limitations of around 100 GHz. The field sensors, their supporting structure, and their signal-transmission paths will be designed to introduce negligible distortion on the radiators and HPM fields being measured.BENEFIT:The R&amp;D undertaken as a result of this program will dramatically impact the state-of-the-art of photonics-based electromagnetic-field sensors, not only from the standpoint of technological specifications such as the real-time detection bandwidth and dynamic range, but also from the perspective of the cost-effective implementation of a large number of simultaneously interrogated field sensors. Information obtained from a nonintrusive, photonics-based, microwave-transient mapping system will identify, for the first time, the undistorted characteristics of pulses of high power microwave radiation in the near field of antennas and in real time. As serious consequences can arise due to the fact that the electromagnetic fields have not yet diverged in this region, and thus the strength of the radiation can be extremely high, precise knowledge of the microwave-transient temporal characteristics, magnitudes, and spatial distributions will significantly aid the study of the human effects of these fields. Commercially, products resulting from the development of a photonics-based, real-time, high-power-microwave near-field mapping system will address numerous military and civilian applications. They will assist in research applications, for instance through measurements of strong electromagnetic fields that could appear both at the surface of humans positioned in the near field of radiators, as well as at the interior of human surrogates (i.e., phantoms). For development applications, nonintrusive fiber-based sensors may be used in a small-area substitute for the very large areas required for far-field-beam measurements for example by placing a sensor array in the near field of prototype antennas in order to extract the amplitude and phase of the emerging radiation before computing the propagation into the far field. As a diagnostic instrument, the photonic-sensor array could be used to periodically calibrate antenna arrays, since the noninvasive probes can be placed close enough to individual array elements that they can quantify deficiencies in magnitudes and\/or undesired phase shifts in the field outputs of distinct unit cells without disturbing their operation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Cognitive skills\/capabilities are important for the military personnel to fulfill tasks and to ensure mission efficiency and success. In the past decade, there are abundant researches suggesting that non-invasive brain stimulation via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) holds great promise to enhance a soldier&apos;s cognitive performances. Although models to predict the tDCS current flow exist, they need to be validated using a high-fidelity head phantom which can mimic both its complex shapes\/configurations and the conductivities of various tissues. Such a phantom, however, is currently lacking. In this proposal, AlphaSense, Inc. collaborates with Harvard Medical School to develop a novel 3D- printed head phantom for tDCS model validation. If successful, the merits of the proposed head phantom and its fabrication method include the following: a) High accuracy for tDCS model validation, b) Fully automatic process for tDCS parameter optimization, c) Capable of generating both generic and subject-specific phantoms, d) Excellent long-term stability, and e) Low fabrication cost.BENEFIT:The outcome of this research is coupled to a very clear commercialization path. The proposed head phantom can be used for both military and civilian applications. The most straightforward military application is to valid various tDCS models, based on which effective therapeutic treatment procedures can be obtained. Consequently, the cognitive performances and learning skills of soldiers and military personnel can be substantially improved to enable mission success. In addition to the cognitive performance enhancement, the tDCS model may also help the researchers to identify therapeutic treatment solutions for the veteran and active-duty solider depression issues. For civilian applications, the proposed phantom can also be used by medical researchers to identify optimum tDCS procedures to treat various medical conditions, including brain injuries, strokes, memory loss, and depression. It should be noted that the proposed 3D printing method is by no means limited to fabricate the phantoms for the tDCS model validation. If successful, it also provides a generic solution to fabricate a wide variety of medical phantoms, including brain, breast and heart phantoms, etc. for various training and surgical treatment planning applications. The potential market is huge for the above-mentioned medical phantoms."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can potentially provide a safe, non-invasive, and painless method for enhancing cognition, vigilance, and learning rate. However, further research is required to evaluate, demonstrate, and understand its efficacy in a controlled and reproducible manner. Hypothesis-driven studies of tDCS require targeted delivery of electrical currents to specific functional regions in the brain, often using specialized scalp electrode configurations. To support such studies, detailed physics-based computational models of head anatomies have been developed to predict distribution of intracranial current densities in response to applied tDCS. For the required validation of these models, Creare proposes to develop an anatomically-realistic, highly-instrumented, head phantom for high-fidelity tDCS studies. Our tDCS head phantom will feature (1) realistic tissue electrical properties, (2) detailed anatomic structure, (3) compatibility with clinical and developmental scalp electrodes, (4) an embedded electrode array for high-resolution electrical field measurements, and (5) an integrated data acquisition system for logging of test data.BENEFIT:Validation of intracranial current distribution models using the tDCS head phantom will allow these tools to be used to optimize tDCS electrode design, scalp placement, intensity, and electrode montage. This can enable use of tDCS to enhance cognitive performance and vigilance, as well as, improve clinical efficacy of therapeutic non-invasive brain stimulation treatments for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Typically, an organization like Air Force Material Command (AFMC) has a large computing environment which grows organically over a period of years with a mix of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and custom applications, often with overlap and gaps in functionality. Understanding this application environment what is there and who uses it, and the purpose being served can be very difficult. The Praeses team proposes development of Connote, a solution that will provide large organizations, like AFMC, the capability to inventory, document and visualize software systems. Once completed, the mature application will give organizations the means to efficiently and cost-effectively analyze a highly complex system environment leading to a much improved ability to manage its data. The Connote prototype, envisioned in Phase I, will include a parser to generate a parse tree of a target system (initially COBOL), a triple-store database to store the systems structure, and a basic user interface to view the structure. Connote will eventually include multiple ontologies, each focused on a specific subject. A successful Connote application will effectively uncover system data and relationships at significant performance gains over traditional approaches. BENEFIT:The ultimate goal is for Connote to become a highly functional tool to discover the business knowledge embedded in an organizations current systems. Through the use of specific ontologies, logical inferencing and semantic web tools, Connote will provide the needed cross-functional documentation capability in a more efficient, less-costly manner for the enterprise user. This should yield significant value to AFMC, any DoD organization or private business as a means to facilitate system integration\/modernization efforts. Potential benefits of Connote include the ability to: 1) correlate data structures both from within a common system and language or across different systems and languages, 2) follow data flow between programs and systems, 3) map standard domain semantics to code, 4) quickly discover where decisions are made and transforms are applied, 5) visualize program, system, and data structures, 6) define one-stop repository for system and program documentation, and 7) link code with documentation. The potential target market includes all organizations with multiple large-scale software systems that would benefit from the improved performance that integration provides. Organizations must, prior to any large-scale integration, gain visibility into their application stack. Failure to do so will very likely lead to a failed integration\/modernization effort for the organization at significant costs in time, expense and business disruption. Connote reduces the time and effort required to gain this visibility in large computing environments (including AFMC, other DoD organizations and private businesses) and provides a significant advantage over manual system analysis processes. This is potentially a very large target market within which Connote would be used."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Specific cyber deception challenges under APT threat require a high degree of consistency and depth of deception. In order to be able to withstand an attackers multi-pronged reconnaissance efforts, DOD and civilian networks require a software platform with advanced cyber agility and moving target defense capabilities, that also provide for a flexible deception infrastructure with low cost of re-deployment and minimal effect on system performance. Existing cyber deception solutions and research prototypes only demonstrate frameworks based on selected techniques and methods that do not satisfy the depth, consistency or maintainability requirements needed for the APT challenge. To address these critical needs, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes the DeceptoGuard solution to build a flexible system that introduces a full range of cyber deception capabilities based on novel anti-reconnaissance and moving target defense technique to impede, mislead and confuse an attacker. DeceptoGuard units deployed at key locations in the network, collectively thwart reconnaissance attempts by creating a perception of transient network environment, by randomizing and polluting the network attack surface, and by making it difficult for an attacker to determine the direction, volume and importance of network traffic.BENEFIT:DeceptoGuard can be directly applied to the military and security contexts. The ability to provide anti-reconnaissance protection against external attackers, as well as against an internal threat, will significantly disrupt cyber threats and enhance cyber deception capability. Both government and commercial organizations will benefit from the development of DeceptoGuard due to their significant unmet needs for effective cyber security solutions that protect their mission and business goals. The DoD along with several other government organizations (e.g., DHS, DoE, etc.) are actively pursuing multiple cyber security related technology development programs related to cyber deception and moving target defense. A wide range of DoD networks and systems need a stronger operation posture against attacks, and can potentially be enhanced by the proposed work. DeceptoGuard has significant commercial potential for applications such as corporate security design, information security, and cloud configurations. End users of DeceptoGuard include network security tool providers (e.g., Symantec, McAfee, SourceFire) to defend network infrastructure from both inside and outside threats; information security consulting companies (e.g., NSS Labs) to enhance the cyber security services they provide; and large commercial organizations including financial (e.g., Bank of America, Citibank), retail (e.g., Amazon, Overstock), and healthcare (e.g., United Healthcare, Humana)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To enable mission assured operations of aerial IP networks in a hostile cyber threat environment, the Air Force has identified the need for cyber defense technologies which will thwart such cyber attacks on these networks preemptively, i.e., before they are launched by the adversary. To address this need, Architecture Technology Corporation (ATC) proposes Cyber Hardening and Agility Technologies for Tactical IP Networks (CHATTIN), a software product which implements a collection of innovative cyber hardening and agility techniques. CHATTIN proactively protects tactical IP networks by avoiding cyber attacks using a strategy akin to the anti-access and area denial strategy used by the military to deter enemies. Currently, vulnerabilities within tactical IP networks present an easy target for our adversaries to conduct cyber operations and achieve devastating effort at low cost. CHATTIN will reverse this asymmetry that currently favors our adversaries by making it prohibitively expensive and difficult for them to conduct cyber operations on tactical IP networks. The Phase I effort will develop the detailed design of the CHATTIN product and establish its effectiveness and implementation feasibility.BENEFIT:IP-based wideband tactical radio waveforms such as TTNT, SRW, CDL, and MUOS are becoming an integral part of Air Force battlefield networks. CHATTIN will directly address the cyber security needs of these tactical IP networks. CHATTIN also addresses the cyber defense needs of the Joint Aerial Layer Network envisioned by the Air Force and well as the needs of AFRLs Aerial Layer Networking program. The Armys WIN-T network and the Navys ADNS are all IP enabled tactical networks which are currently operational and are attractive targets for CHATTIN also. The initial non-military market for CHATTIN would be in public safety, first response, and disaster relief, for providing a secure and reliable tactical communications infrastructure. Beyond that, other emerging commercial markets for CHATTIN include vehicular ad hoc networks and the Internet of Things (IoT)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In airborne black network, a pair-wise HAIPE device sets up an encrypted tunnel to transport sensitive and classified information through unsecure wireless transmission. Due to the nature of open air medium and some unprotected information in black network, wireless transmissions in airborne networks are susceptible to many malicious activities. In addition, the current fixed nature of the attack surface presented by the airborne networks provides adversaries with ample opportunity to analyze the network topology and behavior, allowing them to carefully plan attacks over time and to launch attacks. To better protect IP-based airborne networks from cyber-threats, IAI proposes to develop a Network ObfuscAtion and Hardening (NOAH) solution for tactical IP networks. The main objective of NOAH is to significantly improve cyber agility and hardening capability in airborne networks and to protect them from cyber-attacks. By leveraging state-of-art cyber agility and hardening technologies, NOAH makes it extremely difficult for the adversary to analyze the airborne networks and obtain an engagement on the target for launching a successful attackBENEFIT:A wide range of DoD and commercial systems suffer from the need for a stronger operational posture against attacks and can potentially be enhanced by the proposed work. Complex systems such as the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) and Global Information Grid (GIG) must be secure, survivable, and maintain an operational posture with maximum transparency through cyber-attacks and malicious attempts. Besides tactical networks, enterprise systems require security to allow sensitive financial, industrial, and personal information to be transmitted across computer networks. Countless time and money is spent as system administrators constantly work to stay ahead of potential attackers, effort which the proposed approach will help obfuscate tactical networks and defend against cyber-attacks. The key capability of NOAH is its ability to provide high level of cyber hardening and agility to a network and prevent traffic analysis needed for targeting of attacks and launch of sophisticated attacks. Based on the market study of cyber security solution, potential revenue for NOAH is estimated to be more than $50M during the first 10 years of commercialization. IAI also plans to explore licensing opportunities with prime contractors and systems integrators for custom integration to address the needs of specific government and commercial clients"

At the same time, the complexity of networked computing systems, their dynamic behavior, and the availability of many heterogeneous devices that are static and mobile make these tools incapable to accurately characterize current states, detect malicious attacks, and stop them or their fast propagation and\/or minimize their impacts. In this phase I project, we propose a closed-loop control system (AMAP) that continuously monitors the cyber resources and services 24 by 7, performs anomaly behavior analysis to detect malicious activities and proactively either recommends actions to stop attacks and minimize their impacts and\/or responds automatically depending on the severity of the detected malicious attacks and their potential impacts on the overall system operations. Our proposed solution is based on the following novel features: Novel data structure that we refer to as Cyber DNA (CDNA) that will be the basis of our anomaly behavior analysis as well as root-cause analysis, Self-Management Engine (SME), and Knowledge Representation and Visualization. BENEFIT:The benefits include the unprecedented autonomic management and protection capabilities for cyber resources and their applications as well as the knowledge representation and visualization tools. The AMAP will be able to accurately characterize current states, detect malicious attacks, and stop them or their fast propagation and\/or minimize their impacts."

Phase I effort will include simulations and flight tests.BENEFIT:Multi-Antenna, MIMO, techniques have been proven to significantly improve the throughput, reliability and range of wireless communication systems. Subject to environmental conditions, as much as 20 dB improvement in the link margin, up to 10x reduction in the TX power for the same throughput, up to 30 dB of interference mitigation, and several factors improvement in the achievable throughput. A MIMO applique technology will provide these gains to the legacy USAF waveforms and radios within a relative short timeline. Example Air Force &amp; Other DoD applications: A bolt on MIMO applique can serve several USAF communication needs: (a) Spatial interference mitigation applique for Link-16 terminals (b) Spatial diversity applique for TCDL radios on low flying aircrafts (c) Spatial multiplexing applique for BE-CDL and STD-CDL terminals (d) Interference mitigation for ARC-210 radios (e) Spatial interference mitigation for SRW\/WNW radios Commercial Applications: Spectral efficiency enhancement for commercial cellular backhaul: Silvus is excited about the tangential opportunity that a bolt on spatio-polarimetric multiplexing module creates in the commercial cellular backhaul market. The proposed solution is minimally invasive to existing E-band links and can be added to existing fixed commercial cellular backhaul installations, thus improving capacity in the same bandwidth allocation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) RF systems are revolutionizing the RF communications industry by transforming historically problematic, heavily faded RF environments into rich, multi-channel media data rates enhanced by factors of 2-4X or more. Although the air-air datalink scenario does not enjoy the rich multipath environments that are exploited by commercial and military MIMO systems, many of the salient features of MIMO can be applied to airborne directional datalink systems to great effect. In this program, we investigate three MIMO-related enhancements that are applicable to any distributed aperture airborne data link system. The three techniques to be studied include orthogonal polarization in the Tx\/Rx antenna to upgrade link capacity, utilization of multiple antenna arrays in receive mode, and inclusion of a novel fast-search methodology to reduce discovery time. Numerous existing directional datalink systems incorporate multiple high-gain antenna arrays which provide a strong base for significant MIMO-inspired capability enhancements with the introduction of the proposed applique. All three of our proposed concepts have great potential to enhance the capacity, robustness, and other performance aspects of legacy distributed datalink systems without requiring changes to the current radio or waveform.BENEFIT:Although FIRST RFs proposed investigation is focused on legacy airborne datalinks, the technology has direct applicability to other applications that utilize distributed antennas. These technologies provide a path to improve ground tactical systems as well. The system provides several key benefits including increased (ideally double) link capacity and data rates to support larger networks and greater throughput for ISR, heavily cooperative, and other data-intensive missions. Elegant signal combination results in a more robust system that achieves improved signal-strength links without dropouts as nodes change in bearing with one another (switch loss). A fast, LPI\/LPD, ad-hoc in-flight network reconfiguration is achieved using a novel discovery approach improving reassignments and other reconfiguration requirements imposed by the mission. With these potential benefits, the applicability of this technology extends beyond the scope of airborne directional datalink systems and has other military as well as commercial applications. FIRST RF looks forward to working with Air Force to explore the applicability of this technology to the near-term need for datalink missions."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Wireless connectivity and situational awareness of warfighters are critical in current and future warfare. Maintaining network connectivity and achieving situational awareness require continuous exchange of information across the network, which eventually drives the need for reliable, high data rate communication links. Multiple antenna technology - commonly referred to as multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) - promises high data rate by multiplexing several data streams, and improves reliability using spatial diversity (each antenna experiences a different wireless channel, and the chances that all the wireless links are poor are small). One way to achieve MIMO capabilities on legacy radios is by transforming\/redesigning the waveform and the radio hardware .Replacing these with new MIMO radios will have a huge economic impact. Therefore, at least in the short term, it makes economic and practical sense to make these radios MIMO-capable without modifying the waveform or the radios. We propose to develop a MIMO Applique for Radios without Modifying Legacy Waveforms (MARWL). BENEFIT:The proposed technology and program will provide multiple-antenna capability to existing radios using different types of waveforms, and therefore the applications span the entire military communication space. Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) is a non-operational domain, wherein different waveforms are used for T&amp;E operations (e.g., telemetry)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Trusted platform module(TPM) devices provide the core root of trust for modern computer systems. These devices are used for secure, trusted, and measured boot approaches as well as to secure data for user applications such as Microsoft&apos;s Bitlocker technology. However, more and more systems are now virtualized in the cloud. Currently hypervisor technologies either do not provide guests with the needed TPM functionality, or provide a limited and insecure virtual TPM approach. GrammaTech proposes the development of a secured virtual TPM server technology, which can be leveraged by all hypervisor systems to provide guests with virtual TPM instances. The approach will leverage hardware enforced isolation mechanisms and the physical TPM of the system to ensure guests have exclusive access to an assigned virtual TPM. In addition, by creating an interface for QEMU, many common hypervisors will be immediately able to leverage the technology. During this development, GrammaTech will be seeking to combine this technology with both existing hypervisors and GrammaTech&apos;s own secure hypervisor technology. Our approach has the advantage of the flexibility to be applied anywhere, while providing a new level of security to the virtual TPM.BENEFIT:GrammaTech will provide a virtual TPM server technology be added to most virtualization systems. The benefits of our approach are adaptability and security. The developed technology will be applied to both existing hypervisor solutions and GrammaTech&apos;s secure hypervisor solution to provide additionally security capabilities guests of cloud systems. This will enable new security measures to be taken to protect guest systems including secure boot and measured root of trust for users of cloud technology."

ESM will be compatible with the existing TPM standard, available TPM software stack and applications. Based on its flexible architecture and implementation, ESM will also provide extra cryptography operations for the guest OS and applications running in QEMU. In addition, the security of ESM itself will be verified and enhanced through advanced compiler and software testing technologies. Together, ESM provides a trusted and verified foundation to ensure the security of OS and applications running in QEMU.BENEFIT:The probable commercial customers are sensitive data owners who want to adapt to the virtualization technology, but are concerned about its level of security. IAIs proposed ESM technology can be applied to existing virtualization environments in order to enhance its security. In addition to the proposed ESM technology, IAI has completed or is currently developing a range of related cloud-based tools. Integration of the proposed ESM technology with IAIs current cloud-based tools broadens the product base and application to potential markets. End users of ESM include cloud providers (e.g., Amazon), commercial organizations (e.g., Citibank, United Healthcare) that use virtualization technologies. The estimated addressable market size of the proposed ESM technology will be $500M+ in the civilian and commercial segments and $300M+ for military applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The proposal presents an Intelligent Image Compression Broker Based on Objective with Feedback. A novel structure is applied to receive the input image\/video, its metadata (environment and camera parameters), and the feedback from the compressed image quality evaluation to optimize the tradeoff between the compressed image quality and its size (in terms of bits the compressed image occupied). We also propose to apply machine leaning techniques to train the compression method and parameter selection broker, which also accepts real data as a part of the reference as the image quality and the application requirement match each other. Due to the application of the novel system structure, the image compression broker has the capability to continuously adjust the compression algorithm and parameters, and thus the image compression performance is optimized.BENEFIT:The first near term DOD application targets are the Air Force programs, E2AT- Multi-INT Enhanced Exploitation and Analysis Tools, DCGS-X-Distributed Common Ground System program (Air Force), SSN-space surveillance network, SBSS-the Space Based Space Surveillance system, SBIRS-Space-Based Infrared System program, JSARS-JSPOC Situational Awareness Response System. IFT will focus on marketing the resultant technology to its existing Air Force customers. As the first priority, IFT will leverage existing activities that IFT has with several Air Force programs that can quickly take advantage of this highly critical technology. The second priority is to target the Office of Naval Research Data to Decisions program for automated processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) operations, and other related programs where BAE Systems serves as the Prime Contractor.  Beyond the E2AT applications, the innovative solutions developed under this program will improve automated PED and decision making for many military applications. IFT and its industry partner will aggressively pursue other applications. As a metric for this task, the technology is also applicable to commercial systems. Our target application will focus on domestic, civic, and humanitarian applications, such as disaster response, environmental research, and law enforcement."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Link-16 is a NATO military tactical data exchange network that enables fighting forces to exchange their tactical pictures in near-real time, as well as send and receive text messages, imagery data, and digital voice. Link-16 radios typically are aboard aircraft, ships, and combat vehicles. However a need for hand-held Link-16 radios that are small enough for battlefield airmen to use while on foot is ever increasing. To fill the existing technical gap, IAI proposes to develop a POwer Efficient Modular (POEM) Link 16 handheld device, which employs modular, flexible hardware architecture that separates the radio functionality into multiple technology components. The modular flexible POEM device architecture enables power efficient handheld design by optimizing power consumption and resource utilization at each component. It also makes new emerging technology insertion relatively easy and allows the device being used not only for communications, but also for other functions by changing how waveform processor generates and receives signalsBENEFIT:The key capability of POEM device is its power efficient modular architecture. As POEM device can upgraded and modified to reflect new radio and waveform requirement quite easily, PEOM device has great potential to be marketed at military and commercial radio market. For this program, IAI will work closely with prime contractors to successfully transition the technology to relevant DoD tactical radio programs. To commercialize the technology, IAI will investigate both licensing the technology to a commercial partner to develop commercial radios (e.g., a Land Mobile Radio (LMR)). IAIs business model is to conduct multidisciplinary collaborative R&amp;D and transition the resulting technology to products, Government Programs, and\/or licenses to Market Leaders. Based on the initial market study of military tactical radio and commercial LMR, potential revenue for POEM device is estimated to be extremely promising during the first 10 years of commercialization"

A reduced-Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) platform supporting the Link 16 waveform will lead to handheld devices for the dismounted soldier. Additional application of waveform optimization techniques will also be used to augment the Link 16 waveform for handheld applications. GIRD Systems will use its expertise in JTRS waveform development, analysis, and porting to investigate novel approaches to small form-factor platform architectures.BENEFIT:Due to the near universal presence of Link 16 on U.S. and coalition fighters a handheld Link 16 terminal will significantly benefit dismounted operators via the real-time situational awareness feeds and direct targeting dialogs supported by Link 16 nets. A small, affordable Link 16 terminal will also benefit disadvantaged platforms such as vehicles and Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) for situational awareness, real-time target cueing, and fratricide avoidance. The design developed in the Phase I work plan, if successful, will lay the foundation for small, power-efficient, yet computationally capable devices for fielding additional applications, such as interference cancellation and compressed sampling in dismount mission scenarios, and smart munitions, among many other possibilities."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:A resilient host-based defense must proactively adapt to new attacks and support mission success before, during, and after the attack. Before the attack, a host-based defense must implement defensive measures that do not incur significant overhead for each host or for the enterprise infrastructure. During the attack, the defense technology must present a small attack surface and fight through the attack by limiting the extent of damage caused by successful attacks on both itself and the host. After the attack, the defense technology must swiftly restore full functionality to the system in a way that reduces vulnerability to a repeat attack. We have designed a framework from the bare metal up to the user application that isolates components, so any compromises are limited, detectable, and recoverable. We propose to develop a Distributed Multivisor that provides hardware-enforced isolation to individual software components on a host while presenting a mainstream OS (e.g., Linux) interface to the user and application developers. The Distributed Multivisor enables fault isolation, fault detection, fault recovery, and attack avoidance. Most importantly, it supports these features while guaranteeing strict performance guarantees, so mission-critical applications continue to execute. BENEFIT:We expect the full-scope Distributed Multivisor to have immediate and tangible benefit for a number of military systems that rely on host-based defenses. In particular, Distributed Multivisor will help defend host machines from attacks and enable them to fight through the effects of the attacks with minimal disruptions. Augmenting enterprise hosts with the Distributed Multivisor will enable users to securely execute mission-critical applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In this proposed effort, we propose a virtualization-based framework, called virtual shield, to protect the end systems in an enterprise network. Virtual Shield follows the diversity, moving target defense and fight-through strategies to defend against cyber attacks. The Virtual Shield architecture adopts various resilient techniques to make the protection approaches more agile and adaptive to cyber attacks. Virtual Shield also employs a virtual machine introspection technique to monitor the execution of an end system and detect malware without deploying agents in the monitored system. Moreover, Virtual Shield fully utilizes virtualization to implement the capabilities of freezing, duplicating and moving an end system in the network, thus making moving target defense feasible. Finally, these proposed techniques will be integrated in a workable framework prototype to show the feasibility of our proposed approach.BENEFIT:The proposed solution is well-suited for application protection in an enterprise network. Both commercial and military markets will benefit from the development of the proposed solution for infrastructure security, particularly in a network environment under advanced cyber attacks. In addition, it can also be applied to protect valuable data asset or mission critical services, providing a fight-through protection and failover. The proposed solution also has great commercial market potential. DoD efforts to consolidate and reduce data center via virtualization are anticipated to save $3 billion annually by 2015. The global cyber security market is growing at 11.3% CAGR and is estimated to reach $120.1B by 2017. The addressable market size for the proposed solution is estimated to be more than $200+ million during the first 10 years of commercialization. Potential end users include security tool providers (e.g. Symantec, McAfee, SourceFire); Banks (e.g., Bank of America); and virtualization software developers (e.g., VMWare, Microsoft)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Legacy narrowband military waveforms are limited in their throughput (data rate) and can typically carry only a single type of traffic. Special Operations Forces, however, require a communications solution that can deliver and transport a blend of information from multiple systems and sources. The ideal SOF communication system should provide immediate links to Command and Control; Fires; ISR; Battle Space Awareness; Tactical Logistics; and Information for Force Protection. Additionally this system should enable timely reach-back to application and to supporting staff in order to quickly obtain and ana-lyze information. A key component of this blended information delivery mechanism is a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) that complements the legacy communication and ISR capabilities. Our proposed solution is a handheld radio system that augments the legacy radio with a mission mod-ule (add-on module) containing both a highly advanced MANET based a state-of-the-art multi-antenna MIMO Physical layer, and a multi-waveform ISR link with ROVER functionality.BENEFIT:As an add-on element, the Advanced MANET plus ROVER\/CDL MM will be an accessory that could be added to existing procurement contracts during the regular technology refresh cycles. Moreover, with an a la carte pricing strategy, the mission module could also be purchased directly in small volumes. The ability to complement narrowband communications as well as voice-grade MANET solution such as SRW with a high throughput MANET capable of transporting 10s of Mbps worth of data across spans of up to 10 km will signficantly improve potency and mission success."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Special Forces Operations operators are often deployed outside or beyond traditional logistical supply chains therefore everything they carry is at a premium and comes with a trade-off. A typical special operation group would need a UHF\/VHF communication channel for close air support (CAS), a UHF channel for satellite communications (SATCOM), a HF\/VHF\/UHF channel to communicate with an advanced operations base (AOB), and another HF\/UHF channel to communicate with the special operations task force (SOTF). This means carrying four (4) separate radios, each with different batteries and cables. To address these needs, Intelligent Automation, Inc., proposes to develop the ONERADIO system. For the proposed solution, IAI will modify the current radio to meet the communications requirements for Special Operations Forces (SoF). This will allow SoF units to replace multiple single-channel radios with one multi-channel radio. This will greatly reduce the communications size, weight, and power the units are carrying.BENEFIT:The DoD along with several other government organizations (e.g., DHS) are actively pursuing multiple radio \/ mobile communications related technology development programs. However, one of the greatest challenges facing these programs is backward compatibility. Creating a new modern radio system requires the ability to interface with currently fielded tactical radios. ONERADIO can bridge the technology gap between legacy radios and modern radio systems. Any DoD system using tactical radios would benefit from ONERADIO."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Cyber detection and defense techniques and research typically focus on malicious actions and the damage they cause and rarely focus on how adversaries discover which action to take. A promising approach for addressing reconnaissance attempts is to use moving-target defense (MTD) methods that seek to reduce the attack surface by limiting the adversarys ability to gain an accurate picture of the enterprise topology. Unfortunately, MTD techniques change everything for everybody, and legitimate users are as likely to be tripped up as the adversary. Additionally, MTD typically requires extensive retooling and is therefore too costly to be deployed on every host in the enterprise. Complementary to techniques such as MTD, are techniques that reduce the defense surface to enable focused defenses based on the adversarys actual attack. Our Thwart Reconnaissance Attempts with Adaptive Deception (TRADD) approach addresses this half of the complete picture. TRAAD actively engages the adversary and uses natural language processing (NLP) understanding and generation techniques in concert; first to enable us to understand the goals behind an attackers reconnaissance activities and then to enable us to generate the most appropriate deceptions based on our ability to detect and predict the attackers goals and next moves.BENEFIT:We expect the full-scope TRAAD system, as well as the reconnaissance-detection, decoy-generation and attack surface visualization components, to have immediate and tangible benefit for a number of military cyber defense programs. These components can also be integrated into existing IDS and AV products or sold as a stand-alone product to businesses, especially those in the finance and defense sectors as they are often the victims of sophisticated attacks. Additionally, because TRAAD focuses on decreasing the defense surface and techniques that complement moving-target defense (MTD), it can benefit any enterprise using MTD to defend mission-critical applications and data."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:System reconnaissance is the typical first step in a targeted attack; the attacker must learn the services available, software used, and operating system configuration in order to determine how to best infiltrate a given system. Reconnaissance is then best thwarted by providing false or non-reusable information to an attacker. ATC-NY will design and build SWARM, a System-Wide Application Randomization Mechanism, to provide false and non-reusable system information to potential attackers. SWARM combines ephemeral virtual machine technology with system-wide Application Binary Interface (ABI) changes, source code and configuration changes, and application-level randomization, giving each system instance a unique set of operating characteristics. By evolving systems characteristics over time, SWARM ensures that any information an adversary does have is incorrect by the time he uses it. SWARM does this while not impacting normal operations and with little to no performance impact.BENEFIT:SWARM dramatically slows down a potential attacker because he is not able to gain accurate information about host system configuration, and any information he does have will be outdated by the time he can apply it. With its automatic build and deployment framework, there is no additional burden on system management personnel to gain this benefit. SWARM can benefit network servers as well as desktop workstations. In addition to providing anti-reconnaissance measures, SWARMs architecture reduces the persistence of any attacks that do succeed, provides diversity of implementation for survivability and safety, and can also aid in software and protocol testing. These benefits apply to both DoD and commercial entities storing sensitive information, including personal health information, accounting data, or trade secrets."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To address the Air Force need for Android mobile device (MD) virtualization and Mediated Mobile Access (MMA) solution, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Secure Hypervisor for Mobile Device (HyperM) based on integration of a POC-developed and proved mechanism for information protection on commercial MDs with a COTS hypervisor adapted for MD applications. This integration results in a comprehensive MMA solution that provides full protection of data-at-rest, data-in-use, and data-in-transit on MDs. POCs mechanism for information protection on MDs provides required centrally managed access control, two-factor user authentication, remote attestation, authorization, and information encryption in transit and at rest. The COTS virtualization technique provides an additional layer of protection via hardware virtualization and MMA. In Phase I, POC will develop a design and framework for a MMA solution for an Android guest on a tablet with hardware virtualization extensions providing protections for data-in-transit and data-at-rest, and demonstrate feasibility by assembling and testing a prototype. In Phase II, POC plans to develop per Air Force direction a complete MMA virtualization solution and prototype that provides full data-at-rest, data-in-transit, and data-in-use protections, with remote attestation functionality for specific tablets and cell phones, and demonstrate the solution in relevant environments.BENEFIT:A DoD enterprise-wide business environment and other organizations will benefit from the integration of protected Android mobile devices (MDs) into an organizations business system. POCs HyperM technology can be incorporated by the Air Force into MDs as an efficient means to access DoD systems and Web services. The proposed HyperM will provide reliable protection of sensitive information on employees MDs against online and offline intrusion and compromise. The HyperM has multiple commercial applications for law enforcement agencies, first responders, financial services, enterprise networks, manufacturing, aerospace, scientific organizations, health care businesses, public transportation, multi-domain Web SSO, civilian government organizations, and the general public. NASA space systems will also benefit from POCs HyperM technology. With the ever-growing mobile technology industries in the U.S. and around the globe, the HyperM has strong potential to be a lucrative product in the private sector."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:As increasing cyber threats are targeting mobile devices, the idea of applying virtualization to mobile devices has been prevalent recently. The Virtual Machine (VM), i.e., virtualization, technologies have shown great potential to significantly enhance the security level of mobile devices, and developers have begun porting existing VM technologies to mobile devices, such as Xen and KVM on ARM devices. However, these approaches are not widespread due to the performance penalty introduced by system-level virtualization. In this effort, IAI propose to develop SEMOVA, a secure and efficient OS-level virtualization architecture for mobile devices. SEMOVA allows multiple Android guests to run simultaneously on the same physical smartphone while providing native hardware device performance. Furthermore, SEMOVA utilizes a set of protection techniques to protect the data-in-use, data-at-rest, and data-in-transit. The SEMOVA will significantly reduce the overhead of running multiple Android instances, while improving secure access within untrusted environments.BENEFIT:The proposed solution is well-suited for securing resource-limited mobile devices within untrusted environments. The proposed solution has great potential in Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) programs. The emerging of BYOD concept requires a secure and easily configurable environment to different mobile systems and applications with different security levels. SEMOVA can provide a rigid isolation of applications for different scenarios and guarantee the corresponding security requirements. The addressable market size of the proposed SEMOVA technology is expected to be more than $200+ Billion in the civilian and commercial segments and $50+ Million for military applications."

The creation of an app enabled cloud-computing exploitation system introduces a number of challenges that must be addressed. In particular this topic requires that we address problems in the categories of 1) real-time operation, 2) scalability, 3) platform integration, 4) intra-app communication, 5) sensor exploitation and 6) data prioritization. TDKCs software development experience includes 1) our cloud computing technology which provides the ability easily leverage a distributed set of compute nodes for the purpose of image data processing; and 2)our real-time imaging technology that operates on all types of geo-referenced data, including intelligence imagery from full motion video (FMV) and wide area motion imagery (WAMI) systems.BENEFIT:OBSERVE provides a technology that could allow for rapidly composed systems tuned to a specific distributed computing environment. The resulting system supports the addition of sensors and the scaling of the compute platform. This has numerous government, military, and intelligence community customers including SNCs Gorgon Stare and any other sensor platform on which the ability to gather data is greater than the ability to transmit it and real-time fluctuations in processing performance are expected. TDKCs Commercialization Achievement Index (CAI) is currently 95% indicating our success transitioning SBIR technology."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have grave limitations in the quantity and quality of data that can be transmitted either for end use or exploitation. &amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;This SBIR effort seeks to develop and deploy one or more applications (Apps), similar in concept to those hosted on smart phones and within ground-based clouds, which can access this collected data, process it and then exploit the results using existing or newly developed algorithms. Jove Sciences, Inc. has had extensive experience with the SAR, EO\/IR, and AIS sensors on the General Atomics Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) surrogate during Trident Warrior (TW) 10 and 12. The three Apps proposed here are: the Moving Target Indicator (MTI) M of N Tracker for SAR data (with video SAR capability); data compression for the EO\/IR images to reduce bandwidth; and an on-aircraft version of the AquaQuIPS (AQ) data fusion processor that has been so successful in four TW exercises that it is now running at SPAWAR as a TRL-8 real time processor. These three on aircraft Apps will enable the war fighters to use a clear and accurate display of contact tracks in time to make critical tactical decisions.BENEFIT:There are two separate commercial applications for AQs capabilities. Phase II.5 integration of AQ into large Navy PoRs, such as NAVSEA&apos;s Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) and PMW-120&apos;s\/SPWAR&apos;s DCGS-N II, will provide a significant measure of &quot;value added&quot; to a wide variety of Fleet Missions, from ASW to Pirate\/dark ship detection and tracking. CAPT Scott Heller (PME-120) has inserted AQ into the new S &amp; T assessment program for DCGS-N II. If these two Phase II.5 tasks are successful, the natural Phase III task to follow is to have the Fleet evaluate AQs value added, and, if successful, write an Urgent Need Statement (UNS) to OPNAV to develop a PoR to directly address the Asymmetric Maritime Threat (AMT) problem at the Joint level. Pirate ships are killing American citizens now, dark ships in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea are running illicit arms and other contraband to rogue terrorist groups, and drug runners from Columbia and the Far East now have semi and fully submersible submarines that are capable of carrying nuclear weapons or other WMD to U.S, ports. The AMTs will go from the severe threat to individual ships today to a potential delivery vehicle for a nuclear weapon or other WMD. The second commercial customers are the ship routing companies, whose fees are more than paid for by reductions in insurance costs if ships can be routed safely and efficiently to their destinations. Two factors that make AQ capabilities most valuable to ship routers are the exponential increase in unclassified sensors available now and in the near future and the rising cost of fuel. Ship routing companies are now using AIS as their only sensor to route ships, and this is totally inadequate, especially against threats like Pirate ships worldwide (not just the Horn of Africa) and severe storms and tsunamis like the two that devastated Chile and Japan recently. Over 8 countries are developing unclassified space based radar systems whose data will soon be available. Radars are active sensors capable of detecting dark contacts like Pirate ships, and passive AIS sensors in common use today are useless against dark threats. The ship routing companies do not have a multi-INT data fusion engine like AQ or a ship route-planning tool. Multi-INT data fusion algorithms like AQ take decades to develop, and buying this capability is far more economical than starting from scratch. AQ has worked with PMW-120 for over 20 years and the very best maritime storm nowcasting and forecasting models are available at no cost to integrate withAQ to route ships so they avoid storms and optimize transit time at the same time. With rising fuel costs a few days additional transit time due to storm encounters can be very damaging economically"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Historically, including weather advice within on-going deliberations and planning has relied largely on a time consuming process of disconnected mental fusion of various sources from different systems to gain a shared understanding of the natural battlespace. The application of weather advice on a near real-time basis has been largely ignored except for very specific missions and locations. The proposed IMPACT system promises to provide innovative\/revolutionary ways of dynamically generating\/assessing weather constraints on military operations and incorporating the results (weather risk management\/advice) into active, agile decision-support applications within high tempo, dynamic environments. It offers a novel approach that: addresses high dimensionality, is built for massive scalability, incorporates uncertainty, produces actionable advice, and is interoperable with USAF systems. During Phase I, the project team will conduct research, design, and prototyping of the IMPACT system in order to assess and demonstrate the technical feasibility of the solution.BENEFIT:Our proposed approach will offer Decision Support Applications, a new set of services and components that can be used to efficiently request constraint generation for planned operational activities and receive actionable advice. This capability could support many USAF weather systems such as JET and WDAC as well as similar systems at US Navy and NOAA. Additionally, many different C2ISR systems (e.g., AMC, NASIC, DCGS-AF, DCGS-A) require similar weather impact\/effects analysis."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The weather community has improved the gridded environmental analysis data sets over the years however, the final step of tailoring this data to make it relevant to specific mission profiles has yet to be suitably automated and integrated into decision support tools. For example, weather information provided during mission planning is inadequate or poorly formatted to be useful by planners and commanders, often mission execution decisions are made with little weight given to the weather. PEMDAS proposes a novel approach by developing the Dynamic Weather Impacts System (DWIS) Web-Processing System. DWIS will support decision-makers, mission planners and weather forces by delivering integrated decision aids vice traditional weather data, thus enabling the user to focus on the impacts of predicted conditions and how to mitigate them. DWIS employs concepts which we will prove feasible using todays technology (e.g. enhanced data fusion, faster data processing, more complex algorithms). This enables a dynamic capability to ingest weather information, operational limitations, and cross discipline information (geospatial) at a much higher rate and produce insights that collapse the data-to-decision timeline. Through automation with other C2 tools, DWIS produces a spectrum of knowledge of what is doable and what is not doable for the warfighter.BENEFIT:The Dynamic Weather Impacts System (DWIS) is expected to satisfy the needs of the Air Force by tying together mission planning tools and DoD weather data and generating decision support information based upon mission requirements and forecasted conditions. PEMDAS has the right team to make it a reality and implement it into Air Force weather and C2 systems. We feel the DWIS system is the ideal toolset to unlock the full potential of the Air Forces numerical weather prediction and provide mission planners with the decision support information they desire. While the focus of this development effort will be on meeting the needs of the Air Force, PEMDAS will also seek to address growing commercial applications including aviation weather (private and commercial) and precision agriculture."

Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI), together with its academic partner, proposes to build a novel mission planning tool considering weather impacts for the Air Force. The key innovation is to formulate a mission planning optimization problem, constrained by probabilistic weather forecasts with uncertainties and other conventional variables, and provide a Receding Horizon (RH)-field D* based solution to achieve optimal mission success rates. The optimality of the mission is evaluated on metrics combining both weather related operational risk and other critical factors such as execution time, route distance, and fuel consumption. The proposed solutions will be implemented in a multi-layer fashion and based on a state-of-the-art data analytics platform at IAI. The designed system will also satisfy the generic demands of weather impact support from different program of records such as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).BENEFIT:WeatherMan has significant commercial potential for applications such as aviation hazard mitigation, air traffic management, UAV path planning, transportation planning, and disaster relief and recovery. For example, the small UAV market sector alone is estimated to reach $1.33bn in 2014 with significant potential for growth, where path planning regarding weather has great applications in this market to improve the aviation safety. End users of WeatherMan include Airline companies (e.g. American Airline), UAV delivery (e.g. Amazon), and International NGOs (e.g. International Relief and Development). IAI has contacts within each of these organizations and will actively engage them during the program to generate interest in WeatherMan."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Current full motion video (FMV) toolchains fall short of supporting semantically meaningful archive search for specific objects or object types. We propose the Hierarchical Dynamic Vision Exploitation system (HiDyVE), an end-to-end system for content-based object location and retrieval in operational FMV. HiDyVE combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) specifically adapted to FMV&apos;s quality and data volume characteristics with state-of-the-art object proposal mechanisms for efficient processing. By exploiting CNN layering and sophisticated domain transfer techniques, we minimize the amount of domain-specific labeled data required for training, instead leveraging existing large labeled datasets (e.g. ImageNet) to train the lower layers of the CNN. High-level scene categorizations are also generated. We also store and index intermediate descriptors, allowing the system to dynamically adapt to query concepts not present during training. A sophisticated interactive query refinement (IQR) system further incorporates user feedback to refine the search space, enabling the analyst to more quickly converge on relevant results. Real-world issues of video quality and metadata burn-in are addressed by our proven FMV front-end, which automatically detects on-screen static elements. User interaction is facilitated by our open-source FMV GUI toolkit.BENEFIT:This project will advance the state-of-the-art in computer vision, particularly content-based image recognition and scene understanding in video, but also more broadly by transitioning state-of-the-art techniques for processing high-resolution static images to lower-resolution video data. These improvements would positively impact many application areas, including aerial and ground-based video intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); autonomous navigation; and social media understanding. Contributions from this effort will drive significant interest in the computer vision research community to leverage convolutional neural networks and harness contextual information for dramatically improved object recognition and matching in full motion video (FMV). Further, there is significant commercial potential in addition to military and defense applications. FMV and other video data are growing at unprecedented rates, and companies are looking at unique ways to capitalize on commercial opportunities. Commercial industries such as automotive, semiconductor, consumer electronics, food &amp; packaging, healthcare, and logistics are using vision tracking systems for applications including quality assurance &amp; inspection, tracking, measurement, and identification. The proposed technology has the potential to significantly increase the performance of Kitwares existing technologies, such as video tracking and activity recognition, where scene understanding will help algorithms adapt well to new content."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:STR proposes to develop a design concept and software prototype for Electromagnetic Spectrum Awareness and Dynamic Deconfliction (EMSADD). Our proposed Phase I effort will focus on three research activities: 1) definition of use cases, architecture, and domain models for electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) battle management in the context of Air Force missions such as SEAD and Electronic Attack, 2) development of an EMSADD design concept combining intuitive EOB visualization and conflict alerting to promote situational awareness, and 3) development of a software prototype to demonstrate the utility of the EOB visualization and analysis. Unique aspects of our approach include 1) extensible domain models of EMS usage across missions, platforms, weapons, and sensors backed by operationally realistic EM propagation algorithms, 2) EOB visualization and conflict awareness design informed by Wares Visual Thinking Design Patterns methodology and adaptive layering of information via multiple visual channels, and 3) what if EW engagement analysis tools for EMS decision support, supporting both pre-mission planning and dynamic deconfliction during execution.BENEFIT:The proposed capability would directly benefit operators of the Electronic Warfare Coordination Cell in Air Operations Centers, helping them to deconflict Air Force EMS missions spectrum requirements with existing civilian host nation usage and known enemy usage patterns. The novel EM engagement analysis and dynamic deconfliction capabilities will significantly improve agility to meet real-time EMS needs and reduce likelihood of electronic fratricide or tactical surprise compared to current ad-hoc tools that have failed to adapt to the pace of dynamic combat operations. The extensibility and modularity of our domain modeling approach is well-suited to transition such benefits to other services and joint-level organizations such as the Joint Spectrum Management Element. Commercial applications include spectrum management for telecommunications, public safety, law enforcement, amateur RF usage, and other areas."

(EWA GSI) and team member NextGen Federal Systems LLC propose to examine how to utilize EWA GSIs Electronic Warfare Suite, an Electronic Warfare (EW) training application as the basis for EW Battle Management and Situational Awareness (EWBM-SA) system. The existing training application has all of the radio signal propagation and visualization components as well as signal map overlays to support real time intelligence feeds for display and situational awareness. We will examine other existing electromagnetic spectrum situational awareness approaches and techniques and consider their integration into our system application. Our proposed approach will allow for the Joint Forces Commander to determine through the use of multiple signal map overlays, the situational awareness to improve the utilization of the electromagnetic spectrum. The goal is for the commander to identify conflicts between blue forces spectrum use and potential conflicts between blue to gray\/green spectrum use as well as assess red force operations and other interactions in the electromagnetic domain. The result of our Phase I effort will be a demonstration of our prototype system with limited capability and system design documentation with plan to move forward in Phase II for distributed EWBM-SA application tool.BENEFIT:The anticipated benefit will be to support of commanders to manage the electromagnetic spectrum to improve the usage by blue forces, understand and minimize the conflicts with non-combatant spectrum and understand the use of spectrum by red forces in order to potentially deny spectrum access."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The Air Force needs the capability for near realtime efficient use of spectrum allocation which presently cant be achieved because of the lack of a tool that can automate the spectrum planning process. Furthermore, current operational and tactical spectrum planning and management practices do not keep pace with the operational tempo. Cyberspace and space-based capabilities essential for U.S. operations and are also vulnerable to adversary capabilities with a low barrier to entry such as electronic jamming. Through many research and development (R&amp;D) efforts have been conducted by DOD service branches to address this problem, the current solutions are still static plans that cannot be easily adapted to the dynamics in a theater. This situation results in a common problem of spectrum over-provisioning. This approach then weakens warfighters communication capability and wastes the valuable RF resources needed to succeed in current and future A2\/AD EW environments. To address these needs and challenges, Intelligent Automation, Inc. proposes to develop a dynamic spectrum planning system that can assess electromagnetic interference and enable spectrum situational awareness and dynamic allocation of spectrum.BENEFIT:The proposed effort has tremendous potential in spectrum awareness and planning, C2 decision support, and optimum spectrum usage, which cannot be done by existing tools. The proposed solution adapts to dynamics in a theater and avoids spectrum over-provisioning. This capability will strengthen warfighters communication capability and achieve superiority in today or future A2\/AD EW environments. For non DoD programs we see many potential opportunities to market our capabilities to broadband providers and other key spectrum users. It is estimated that 4G networks could account for more than $150 billion in GDP growth over the next few years. The rising popularity of streaming audio and video among smartphone users is contributing to the consumption of more than a gigabyte of data per month. Spectrum management will be critical in sustaining the projected growth and conserving scarce and expensive spectrum resources. The proposed capabilities will provide a means to help broadband providers make maximum use of available spectrum resources and dynamically respond to changing conditions during large gatherings or other unexpected but significant transient user behavior."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Effective Command and Control (C2) is critical for maintaining the Air Forces operational superiority. However, vulnerabilities in legacy systems may be exploited by adversarial cyber-attacks. Protecting network systems requires operators to sift through volumes of unstructured data. Operators rely on visualizations to manage data for decision-making. However, poor design, functionality, and\/or decision support limits the usefulness of these tools. These limitations result in costly errors because they impede operators situation awareness. In light of these issues, Modus Operandi proposes a Cognitively Enhanced Cyber Command and Control (CEC3) system for supporting cyber operator decision-making. This tool will aid the collection, analysis and structuring of cyber data by placing data into a design artifact that is optimized for conveying that information to support the system design. It will do this by combining the user-oriented, cognitive-centered GIFIC language and the data-analytic power of Modus Operandis VIA platform. By processing and presenting data in this manner, operators can maintain situational awareness and successfully complete their daily tasks.BENEFIT:The CEC3 approach optimizes users situation awareness and decision-making capabilities by augmenting cyber operators ability to consume information. Additionally, this approach reduces up-front data analysis efforts and captures operators subject matter expertise that can be encoded in the display. With CEC3s ability to continually monitor real time network traffic, visualize multi-dimensional data, utilize pattern recognition and sophisticated rules incorporating historic data to identify and alert users of potential adversarial activity will transition well into the commercial Cyber Security Market one of the fastest growing markets in the broad technology sector."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Operators and analysts in modern Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC) must gather and synthesize information from a variety of disconnected sources, including networks, in order to make effective decisions in a complex, distributed operations environment. Current approaches struggle to integrate air, space, and cyber resources in an effective and timely manner. We propose the Tailored Augmentation Leveraging Integrated Information (TALII) system, an adaptive visual analytics tool that leverages context-aware course of action (COA) recommendation and perceptually grounded cyber-spatial visualization design to support situation awareness and efficient decision-making in the future AOC. TALII integrates multiple sources of incoming information into a context engine that maintains awareness of the current mission state and the state of incoming data. This model of context is then combined with perceptually-driven design principles to tailor a visual analytics interface for users in the AOC and distributed users that highlights important information and selects appropriate level of detail to maintain situation awareness. COA visualization and recommendation helps users make faster and more effective decisions under changing conditions.BENEFIT:TALII employs adaptive, context-aware visual analytics that use integrated information structures and COA recommendations to enable faster decision speeds under highly dynamic conditions. It will allow for greater integration of currently separate components of air, space, and cyber operations so that users in AOCs can identify patterns that are not currently visible. By employing a context model that maintains information on data uncertainty and disruptions, TALII can be more resilient to network attacks and conflicting information streams. Commercial applications of visual analytics tools are growing rapidly as data size and complexity increases across domains. At the same time, there are more situations in which decision-makers must act on this data in real time. Such large-scale streaming data analysis is increasingly important to intelligence analysis, financial analytics, and social media analytics. TALII will accelerate decision-making by helping users become more proactive in responding to unexpected events."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Ubiquitous networked sensors and big data computing techniques have the potential to establish geographically distributed teams and a virtual &quot;remote presence&quot; essential to accurate understanding of the situation. However, to date that potential has not been reached. To address this gap, Securboration proposes to develop the Joint Collaborative Augmentation for Sensemaking Environment or JCAUSE. The Team brings a multi-disciplinary approach to develop a collaborative, immersive environment, based on the collaborative sensemaking principle that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The Team applies this to analyzing data with respect to ongoing synchronized joint operations in which none of multiple individuals can fully comprehend the impact of a sudden event on an ongoing or scheduled mission by themselves. While our approach in the Phase I targets sudden network events, JCAUSE accounts for the fact that these occur within the context of broader joint cyber, air, and space operations and have cascading impacts.BENEFIT:The benefit of JCAUSE is the viewing of the responses of each mission resource to an individual cyberattacks. JCAUSE would enable every user viewing the cyberattack to determine overall performance of an individual resources. The ability to provide the operator a deeper understanding of how cyber events are impacting mission operation is required by every major corporation to ensure essential work can continue without shutting down operations."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Applied Defense Solutions (ADS) has embarked upon a new approach to data correlation and aggregation. The ADS Hierarchical Reasoning Tool (HRT) provides a set of unique signatures for automatically recognizing and classifying a resident space object (RSO). Here, we seek to leverage hierarchical reasoning to provide innovative and automated analysis capabilities that capture and learn the normal status and behavior of satellites, detect changes, and assess the implications all within the context of events in the space domain. To assess orbital events and provide for timely decision analysis and courses of action, ADS proposes the development of a scalable automated workflow to support an Orbital Event Characterization Tool (OECT) within a distributed service oriented based architecture. Our primary research goal will be to connect the RSO feature hypothesis generation capabilities of HRT into the OECT capability to provide high level hypothesis management of events, characterize anomalous events, and detect changes in both object appearance and behavior all within context provided by a multi-INT event timeline. Our proposed approach will model and\/or learn the normal behavior of space-based objects via Bayesian update process and leverage ADS operational expertise of satellite operations to generate a hierarchy reflecting mission level object life cycles.BENEFIT:Hierarchical reasoning capabilities provide a structured and mathematically rigorous methodology to correlate and aggregate sparse data from disparate sensors. The completed software tools could be used by both government and commercial entities that wish to not only provide indications of and attribution for anomalous events but also predict the likelihood of future intention and warn of possible threats."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Establishing timely, accurate, and comprehensive Space Situation Awareness (SSA) requires analytic methods that put into context the information drawn from multiple data sources. A vital feature of an SSA system is the capability to predict, and understand, space-based activities that might threaten our satellites. The Activity Learning and Inferencing for Space Situational Awareness (ALISSA) program will address this important operational need by developing, evaluating, and transitioning an innovative capability to learn models of normal satellite operation, and detect operationally relevant deviations from satellite normalcy, built on the synergistic combination of machine learning and multiple hypothesis reasoning methods. In the Phase I program we will: (1) develop an algorithmic approach and overall framework for the problem of improving SSA by learning normal behavior, detecting changes, and reasoning over the implications of those changes; (2) conduct a series of focused investigations and evaluations of algorithms for normalcy learning, anomaly detection, event reasoning; and (3) evaluate the implications of the proposed algorithms on the overall SSA system. The results of the Phase I program will demonstrate the feasibility and promise of the systems concept to be realized in Phase II.BENEFIT:Activity Learning and Inferencing for Space Situational Awareness (ALISSA) offers significant potential benefits to the US Government and commercial satellite applications. Learning normal behaviors, and detecting and reasoning about anomalies, are vital to ensure the physical safety of commercial and military satellites (e.g., through collision avoidance), in addition to enabling the development of accurate space situational awareness. Our work in ALISSA will ensure that further government investment in space situational awareness (SSA) is optimized by maximizing the ability to provide detection and understanding of anomalous satellite events. The current most likely paths for transition are SSA for military organizations (e.g., Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS), NASIC, NRO, and AFSOPS) and commercial satellite owner\/operators."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The LWIR spectrum is well suited for moderate- to long-range free space communications because of its atmospheric window and low scattering by dust, haze, precipitation, and fog. The recent impressive laser development of QCLs is poised to provide the high speed LWIR transmitter for such a free space communication system; a corresponding advance in LWIR detectors is needed to enable the high-speed receiver. The specifics of the LWIR detector requirements are: 8-12 micron wavelength response, GHz bandwidths, and D*=10^13 Jones. The wavelength response and bandwidth requirements are already met by existing detectors, however present detectors are 100 X away from meeting the D* requirement. Meeting the needed 100 X improvement in D* will require 10^4 improvements in both dark current and background current of detectors. This program will develop a detector breakthrough, which will accomplish the 100 X improvement in D*, using an advanced type of resonant cavity-enhanced photodiode (RCE-PD). The RCE-PD developed in this program will have narrow spectral response (at LWIR wavelengths) to limit background current, a thin active region to reduce dark current, and multi-GHz bandwidth.BENEFIT:The detector advance developed in this program is aimed at low noise, high-speed detection of LWIR lasers. In addition to the DoD use of such a detector for free space communications, these detectors are ideally suited for all applications involving detection of both MWIR and LWIR lasers signals. IR monitoring of gases is an especially important example of a commercial application that requires detection of MWIR and LWIR lasers. Rapidly growing applications of such IR gas sensors involve monitoring of green house gases, toxic leaks at refineries and pipe lines, and breath analysis."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Using lasers as signal carriers, FSO laser communications (Laser-Com) can provide a line-of-sight, wireless, high-bandwidth, communication link between remote sites. Because of the reduced scattering, long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) 8 13 um radiation possesses significantly better all-weather transmission than the shorter wavelengths in use today. The superior transmission through common atmospheric problems such as fog, clouds, and smoke coupled with improvements in LWIR laser and modulator design makes possible reliable optical replacements for radio, microwave, and even SWIR\/MWIR FSO communications links in many applications. InAs\/GaSb Type-II superlattices are a developing new technology for the realization of LWIR imaging sensors that has the potential to offer a low-cost LWIR detector for next generation systems. The overall objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate fast LWIR photodetectors based on Type-II superlattices material system. This new superlattice design is expected to show high bandwidth (&gt; 1 GHz) while maintaining the same or even higher sensitivity (D* &gt; 10^13 Jones) as the state-of-the-art photodetector technologies. BY the end of Phase II, a LWIR FSO communication receiver will be demonstrated using our photodetector, custom-made electronics and miniaturized cooler.BENEFIT:Bandwidth is a scarce resource in many of the diverse locations the DoD operates, and satellite communications suffer from high latency and limited available bandwidth. The ability to rapidly move in and set up a free-standing communications link would significantly aid battle-field communications. The use of a point-to-point optical link instead of an RF link avoids interception of communications and reduces the probability that the source and destination of the communications link can be externally detected. The use of LWIR is especially appealing for and ad-hoc environment where being eye-safe allows for much more simple setup. The use of LWIR also makes for better immunity to smoke, fog, dust, or other interferants that would cripple a NIR system. Commercially, Free-space optical communication is a promising solution to the last mile bottleneck of data networks. A dedicated, non-shared, optical link would provide the needed security and data rates for such a situation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Fiber optic network connections onboard airborne platforms must operate in extreme environmental conditions. As a result, these fibers degrade over time leading to faults and reduced performance. A Built-In Test (BIT) capability for the fiber optic transceivers in the embedded systems is required to monitor the fiber optic health and provide diagnostics for rapid repair in the event of failure. Crossfield proposes a multi-protocol VPX Switch with embedded Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (eOTDR) with integrated BIT. The switch will provide a standards-based optical backplane, interconnecting VPX processor and data acquisition modules and sensor payloads at serial data rates up to 56 Gb\/s, with a near term upgrade to 100 Gb\/s. Crossfield proposes to use eOTDR technology developed at Sandia National Laboratories in the switch to perform BIT on each transmit channel. This methodology enables the VCSELs in a transmitter optical engine to operate as both an optical impulse generator and backscatter detector, the two key electro-optical functions required to implement an OTDR. Crossfield will implement the eOTDR functions in an integrated circuit, for integration into the transmitter optical engine along with the VCSELs and VCSEL drivers.BENEFIT:An embedded OTDR chip will provide a important fiber optic diagnostic tool at a small incremental cost to commercial transceivers. A smart transceiver with fiber optic BIT will enable IT professionals to rapidly diagnose failed optical links in commercial data centers."

Our system combines automated part handling, measurement of key dimensions, novel capabilities to assess tip and leading edge wear, and highly sensitive crack detection to address the needs of the Air Force. During Phase I, we will demonstrate key elements of the system, characterize system performance on representative parts, and develop a design for the system to be developed during Phase II. During Phase II we plan to develop a fully functional system to enable the Air Force to evaluate use of the system in an operational setting.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Airdrop accuracy is of paramount importance since airdrop systems landing in unintended locations could create internationally damaging outcomes. There is an opportunity to compensate for local effects by learning their impact on the airdrop trajectory from previous missions. Aurora Flight Sciences is teaming with Boston University to apply deep learning techniques to historical airdrop data at particular drop zones to determine site- and mission-specific biases and increase accuracy at that drop zone. Deep learning can identify complex multi-layer relationships within data and discover patterns without any prior knowledge, enabling detection of trends that are only present when multiple conditions are present. Although deep learning calculations are computationally expensive, they can be run offline to generate a database that can be accessed online based on real-time mission information. The algorithms can ingest additional data as it is collected to update and refine outputs for even greater accuracy. The conceptual tool developed in this Phase I SBIR will plan flight paths and computed air release points based on knowledge learned from past airdrops with the ultimate goal of showing the feasibility of using historical data to improve accuracy at a particular drop zone.BENEFIT:Recent operations in Afghanistan and Syria have increased the interest in precision airdrop as a low cost and safe method of tactical resupply, and mission commanders are continuing to seek ways to improve airdrop accuracy and reliability. Calculation of site- and mission-specific airdrop adjustments will break through the current barrier in airdrop accuracy created by limitations in weather forecasting. Increases in airdrop accuracy reduce risk to our ground and air forces, increase bundle recovery rates, and enable missions at more highly constrained drop zones. Further, this deep learning based technique can be extended to other airdrop system types including humanitarian, dispersion, and guided systems. The tool developed in this effort can be integrated into multiple airdrop mission planning programs including the Consolidated Airdrop Tool, XDrop, and PARANAVSYS. Additionally, it can be extended to high altitude sonobuoy deployment for the Navy."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The United States Air Force must increasingly provide supplies and munitions via airdrop to ground forces spread diffusely over large areas amid hostile enemy-held terrain. The calculation of the airdrop release point is crucial for ensuring safe and accurate delivery to designated landing sites. Wind and parafoil models have insufficient fidelity to accurately predict the landing location from a given release point. We propose a machine learning approach using Gaussian process regression to assimilate historical data of previous trajectories to more accurately learn the predicted landing locations. Having learned more accurately the mapping from release point to landing site, the optimal release point is then selected. Our approach then recalculates small adjustments to the aircraft navigation to achieve the optimal aircraft approach trajectory subject to constraints of a pre-specified flight corridor. The Gaussian process approach provides a unified holistic approach rigorous mathematical framework for probabilistic machine learning that allows the data to speak for itself while imposing very few assumptions. Moreover, we propose a Cramer-Rao bound analysis to determine if an improvement in air drop accuracy can indeed be supported by the data. BENEFIT:The proposed machine learning approach will allow the Air Force to utilize historical trajectory data to improve the accuracy of predicted airdrop landing locations. The process will ensure that supplies and munitions are delivered more accurately and with greater certainty leading to less waste and fewer payloads going astray into enemy held terrain. The approach also provides for optimal navigation updates for the delivery aircraft subject to constraints on terrain and designated safety corridors.The benefits are not restricted to military applications only the same approach will provide improved delivery of humanitarian aid and supplies throughout the world. Numericas intended commercialization is to integrate the approach into the existing Joint Program Airdrop System. Numerica will work with prime contractors and suppliers of airdrop equipment to commercialize the machine learning algorithms to improve commercial airdrop applications. Beyond airdrop applications, improved model predictions via machine learning meets an emerging need in many industries including cyber-security, air traffic safety, and civilian policing."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:MORSE (Mission Oriented Rapid Solution Engineering) proposes an analysis that will verify the existence, and discover the source of a hypothesized bias in the Computed Air Release Point (CARP) planned by the Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT). Historical airdrop data, (some of which MORSE has already processed) will be used to conduct this analysis and produce a bias and error budget. MORSE will then create an adaptive, machine learning tool called the Bayesian N-Dimensional Aerial Delivery Estimator (BNDADE). This tool will correlate historical airdrop data to real-time data in order to estimate bias and provide the aircrew with a real-time adjustment to the planned CARP. BNDADE will consist of three main components: a Bayesian estimator, a bias predictor, and a path planning graphical user interface. BENEFIT:The proposed BNDADE tool will enable the observation of Computed Air Release Point (CARP) bias, and correction of this bias. Ultimately, this will result in improved airdrop accuracy. The tool will initially be developed as a stand-alone application, and will provide a correction to the Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) generated CARP. Future insertion of the BNDADE tool into CAT is readily achievable, and provides the most likely transition path for commercialization within the DoD. MORSE staff included in this proposal have significant experience working with the US Air Force and Jacobs-Tybrin developing and integrating new CAT features."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Significant gains to engine performance are achievable through the development of advanced cooling designs in blade and vane airfoils in order to allow higher turbine inlet temperatures. Correspondingly, reductions in maintenance costs can be achieved through higher confidence evaluation criteria for such cooling designs. In this effort, scaling parameters used between experimental and engine conditions are redefined and a new heat transfer and durability metric is developed to qualify advanced cooling configurations. The results will provide a higher confidence for designers to increase turbine inlet temperature and for operators to relax excessive maintenance intervals. Furthermore, the metric will be applied to qualify the integration of a highly promising cooling design into an airfoil in place of (and compared against) a baseline configuration. To achieve the topic goals, combined computational and experimental analyses will be completed, utilizing the wealth of information available in CFD with the trusted basis of experimentation. Existing experimental data on a baseline turbine configuration augmented with focused testing will be used to validate the computational methods in Phase I. Computational analyses and model developments will be completed primarily at the proposers Indianapolis office with Phase I and II testing completed at Zucrow Labs of Purdue University.BENEFIT:A key benefit of the completed effort will be to bring fidelity forward in the design process to reduce the time and complexity associated with determining the performance of various airfoil cooling concepts. This will benefit both the military and commercial aircraft engine communities. It will also benefit other applications where overcoming difficult heat transfer problems is critical to improving performance, reliability and cost. Examples include heat exchangers in select applications; fast and slow cook off detection and remediation system for ballistic missiles and anti-missile defense systems; ground-based gas turbines and steam turbines; and high temperature reactors."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The Common Embedded Vehicle Network Diagnostics Interface Hardware (CEVNDIH) program defines and implements an AS5643 optimized IEEE-1394-2008 implementation that includes changes, additions and diagnostic features. Designed with the objective of improving reliability, mission availability and improved affordability of the vehicle it is deployed in, the CEVNDIH removes unused IEEE-1394-2008 functionality, improves performance in support of AS5643 and defines diagnostic features used to improve maintenance personnels ability to isolate subsystem, wiring or connector faults. This Phase I proposal defines requirements and verifies the requirements are feasible. Using the requirements, a design specification is created. The design specification is then used to drive the development of the IEEE-1394-2008 optimized solution with diagnostic features. Finally, the implementation is verified to demonstrate feasibility of the implementation in preparation for integration of the PHY and Link into an FPGA in Phase II. BENEFIT:AS5643 defines a very specific use model for the IEEE-1394 bus, and, for this reason, it uses a relatively small subset of the serial buss capability. Optimized to support the AS5643 use case, the design provides the best possible solution, while maintaining AS5643 functional compatibility with existing chip sets. The purpose of the optimization is to remove unused requirements, which in turn translates into fewer lines of code, fewer tests, easier to achieve robustness goals, and ultimately, a more affordable solution. The addition of diagnostic features will improve the usability of IEEE-1394-2008 by helping to predictably isolate subsystem, wiring or connector faults. IEEE-1394\/AS5643 is actively being investigated by the commercial aerospace industry however the lack of a DO-254 certifiable IEEE-1394\/AS5643 implementation is the primary obstacle."

Generally physical properties can impact the injector discharge coefficient which in turn impacts liquid velocity and mass flow for a given injector pressure drop. Under certain circumstances, the discharge coefficient can be made to be insensitive to these properties. Hence the approach taken is to modify the injector configuration to consistently behave as it would under these certain circumstances. Extensive experimental and simulation work will be used to create configurations with a wide range operation under these conditions.BENEFIT:The benefits of this development will be injectors for fuel or other fluids which have no dependency on liquid physical properties.

The conditions that will be targeted are also expected to provide improved atomization behavior which has potential benefit for many combustion systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Jet-in-crossflow fuel injectors are commonly used to fuel gas turbine main combustors and augmentors. The performance of this type of atomizer is sensitive to the engine operating condition, so that fuel placement can vary over the flight envelope. This can lead to suboptimal fueling and combustion stability issues. Similarly, changes in fuel physical properties impact jet penetration and breakup characteristics. The emergence of alternative jet fuels, which can have significantly different physical properties, may exacerbate fuel placement issues. We propose to develop a new fuel injector technology that has improved atomization performance and more optimal fuel placement than existing atomizers. Our approach utilizes air-assist to influence the atomization process. This approach does not involve radical changes to fuel systems, and is therefore well suited for low-cost retrofit on existing engine platforms. Improving atomization performance will enhance both overall combustion stability, and enable the use of alternative fuels with different physical properties without encountering combustion stability issues. In Phase I, we will design and fabricate prototypes and demonstrate their performance relative to jet-in-crossflow injectors in non-reacting flows. In Phase II, we will demonstrate our most promising atomizer designs in an augmentor rig with optical access for direct viewing of fuel placement.BENEFIT:Technology developed under this program will be in the form of new atomizers for gas turbine combustors (both main combustors and augmentors). These atomizers will enhance the combustion stability (static and dynamic) and performance of military jets running JP-8. Furthermore, it will also help enable the transition and certification of alternative fuels. This injector technology will be generally applicable as a replacement technology for systems using jet-in-crossflow fuel injectors including commercial aircraft engines."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The goal of the proposed effort will be to demonstrate a diagnostic technique that can simultaneously measure the combustion progress variable, the flow velocity, and the fuel-to-air ratio with high spatial and temporal resolution to allow the local heat release to be determined. This approach will require the combination of two well-established diagnostic techniques laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and laser acoustic anemometry (LAA). The former method will be utilized to measure local FARs, and the latter method will be employed to measure the speed of sound from which the local gas temperature and velocity can be determined. Once the local FAR, temperature, and velocity are known, the local heat release can be determined from thermodynamic principles. To accomplish this objective the following Phase I tasks are being proposed: Task 1. Construct and Calibrate LIBS System Task 2. Construct and Calibrate LAA System. Task 3. Construct Combined LIBS\/LAA System. Task 4. Conduct Demonstration Tests in Large-Scale Atmospheric Burner. Task 5. Make Recommendations for Phase II System BENEFIT:The simultaneous measurement of FAR, temperature, velocity, and heat release is a significant step forward for the study of real-world combustors. The utilization of LIBS to measure combustion FAR has many commercial applications from automotive to industrial furnaces. The addition of the LAA system greatly increases the range of measurement capability and the usefulness of the experimental data. For example, combustion modeling typical utilized mixture fraction to determine flame characteristics (temperature, species, and pollutant formation) however, what they can only guess at is the local reaction progress variable. LIBS allows measurements of FAR but not the progress variable which requires in this case a simultaneous temperature measurement. The combined LIBS\/LAA instrument provides both numerical and experimental combustor designers an important experimental tool that provides key experimental data for computational model evaluation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The objective of the proposed Phase-I research effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of 10-kHz, 2D fuel\/air (F\/A) ratio and heat release rate (HRR) measurements in laboratory burners at elevated pressures by using pulse-burst-laser (PBL)-based sensor suite. The novelty is the use of advanced PBL technology to generate the desired laser pulses with sufficient pulse energy\/intensity at high-repetition-rate for performing three state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques laser-induced breakdown (LIBS), spontaneous Raman scattering, OH\/CH2O planar-laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) for measuring 2D F\/A ratio and HRR. Compared to state-of-the-art commercially available high-speed lasers, the PBL with ~50x more energy per pulse will extend the LIBS, PLIF, and potentially SRS measurements to 2D. Additionally, a wider tuning range of key parameters including pulse duration, pulse shape, wavelength, repetition rate etc. will be utilized to obtain simultaneous OH\/CH2O PLIF and enhance the LIBS and Raman scattering signal strength. It will thus provide unprecedented insights into the combustion instability phenomena for combustors and augmentors. The proposed compact sensor suite to be developed in the Phase-II will have major impacts on understanding and reducing combustion instability in gas-turbine engines geared toward the development of next generation war fighters and has great potential to being commercially available for government laboratories, engine companies, and universities.BENEFIT:The primary challenges for laser-based sensors for 2D, high-speed, fuel\/air (F\/A) ratio and heat release rate (HRR) measurements using the three state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques (LIBS, Raman scattering, and PLIF) for combustion instability in augmentor and combustors are 1) the extremely high pulse energy\/intensity requirement for the spectroscopic techniques and 2) optical interference from the liquid-fuel combustors\/augmentors. The present situation is that even the state-of-the-art commercial high-speed lasers (e.g., Edgewave\/Credo combo) can only produce sufficient pulse energy\/intensity for point or line measurements for LIBS and Raman. Moreover, those lasers are not viable to generate the desire pulses for all the proposed spectroscopic techniques from a single unit laser source. The research effort on developing pulse-burst-laser (PBL)-based sensor suite will alleviate this deficiency; the development will allow to interchangeable use for 2D F\/A ratio and HRR detections at 10-kHz repetition rate via single unit laser source, thereby enabling multiple diagnostics to be used at full performance in practical combustors and augmentors in a single measurement campaign. All the proposed techniques are simple single beam approach, which makes them easy to be packaged into one fiber-coupled sensor for practical engine diagnostics. We anticipate the novel PBL-based sensor suite developed under this program will enable an array of new marketable products and technologies for investigation of combustion instability in augmentor and combustors. 1. Immediate benefits to Air Force test facilities and OEMs: The development outlined in this proposal will enable high-speed 2D measurements for F\/A ratio and HRR measurements, which will provide unique insights into the understanding of combustion stability in augmentors and combustors. Potential applications for defense missions include the reduction of combustion instabilities, pollution reduction, and fuel and fuel additive studies that enhance the performance and facilitate the design of next-generation combustion and propulsion systems. The proposed compact sensor suite should be applicable for nearly all combustion test facilities and as such will have broad commercial appeal covering most of the government laboratories, engine companies (OEMs), and universities etc. 2. Scientific discovery Better understanding of the fundamental behaviors of complex physical coupling between the unsteady heat release and the resonant acoustic modes as well as F\/A ratio in practical combustors\/augmentors promises a rich field of intellectually stimulating scientific challenges, which in turn can quickly result in revolutionary technologies for advanced gas turbine combustors and augmentors that provide societal benefits via improved combustion stability, higher propulsion efficiencies, low emissions, improved durability, increased ease of manufacturing, and decreased cost. 3. Economic security and prosperity: The roles of gasoline and turbomachinery engines in the modern life are overwhelming. Even slight combustion efficiency improvement with minor reduction of combustion instability by understanding complex physical coupling between the unsteady heat release and the resonant acoustic modes as well as F\/A ratio on the traditional gasoline and turbomachinery engines will have huge impacts on almost every corner of the US economy. In the foreseeable future, combustion of fossil and renewable fuels will be the major power sources for US defense. Other very important application areas include combustion for power generation and transportation. The successful development of these commercial products will help extend the global leadership of the US in R&amp;D and manufacturing of engine technologies."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The increased sound produced by tactical aircraft has become more problematic with the enhanced performance requirements that are being set forth for the next generation war fighter. Given the complexity of the engine and the flow that it produces, accurate predictions of the full-scale exhaust stream and far-field acoustics are still challenging topics, despite over 60 years of jet noise and jet flow research. In particular, trade-off decisions between thrust and noise over a broad range of engine operating conditions continues to be a challenging task. The problem is exacerbated by the additional complexities of having multi-stream nozzles comprising complex geometries. The proposed research aims to eliminate this void by developing a robust and reliable analysis tool capable of predicting the sound performance from a multi-stream and heated supersonic nozzle. The engineering tool that will be developed in the proposed research will leverage order reduction and data fusion techniques to blend the strengths of both laboratory scale experiments and analytical modeling to provide fast answers for critical decisions to be made in the design room.BENEFIT:A successful completion of the research program will see the integration of an experiment-based predictive methodology with engine cycle assessment tools that will have the capability of providing valuable acoustics and performance related information to the aircraft systems design engineers. This methodology will be jointly marketed by CRAFT Tech and their team to prime contractors in order to study its effectiveness on aircraft configurations of interest to the Air Force, particularly supersonic fighters and attack aircraft. However, the effectiveness of the technology is not restricted to military applications; it can be easily extended to the commercial aircraft industry to generate performance characteristics maps over a wide range of engine operating conditions. As noise requirements for commercial aircraft engines becomes increasingly more stringent leading to the development of new engine technologies to meet these revised standards, the technology developed in this SBIR program, in conjunction with experimental measurements, can be used for the identification of an optimal region of engine operating conditions that provides optimal acoustic performance at minimal thrust and performance penalties. Our team can provide the functional predictive acoustics methodology developed during this program in a suitable configuration so as to couple with a desired engine cycle assessment tool."

The goal is to provide robust and reliable noise predictions in minutes that can be used for design optimization. The physics-based approach will be capable of addressing both the noise resulting from engine\/nozzle designs and also the effects of configuration changes.BENEFIT:Current engine performance and noise prediction models are either too costly to use in a design process (e.g. RANS and LES simulations) or are too limited in the geometry they can address (e.g. restricted to axi-symmetric nozzles). In contrast, the current approach promises robust solutions with reasonable accuracy in minutes for nozzles with arbitrary geometry. This level of performance will allow a much tighter integration of complex nozzle configurations (and resulting noise considerations) into the overall design process. This capability will lead both to improved performance and also reduced noise levels compared to what can be achieved with current methods."

This HAN\/HGF based monopropellant has enhanced ignition characteristics and, as a result, can be used in power-constrained CubeSat applications. The team will develop a propulsion system which incorporates a low cost, low pressure feed system (for maximum propellant volume utilization) and a micropump-fed thruster. The Phase I technical objectives include optimizing catalyst preheat temperatures, developing a 1N-class or less thruster, and developing the preliminary design of CubeSat propellant feed and control subsystems. The result will be a highly capable CubeSat propulsion system. Successful demonstration of the green monopropellant with its high specific gravity and reduced toxicity will reduce the industrys dependence on hydrazine-based monopropellants as well as overcome the operational difficulties surrounding AF-M315E and its high light-off temperature in CubeSat applications. This development will greatly reduce environmental and health risks to operations and maintenance personnel, and therefore reduce acquisition and operational costs associated with CubeSat propulsion systems while enabling missions not possible today. BENEFIT:Successful demonstration of a micro-pump fed ionic liquid thruster will improve CubeSat performance through reduced power consumption while increasing performance. Low-pressure liquid propulsion technologies can maximize propellant volume utilization. Successful development of a green monopropellant based thruster and system will greatly reduce environmental and health risks to operations and maintenance personnel, and therefore reduce acquisition and operational costs associated with CubeSat propulsion systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:CU Aerospace (CUA) proposes the development of the Monopropellant Propulsion Unit for CubeSats (MPUC) thruster, a breakthrough complete propulsion system technology for CubeSats and other small satellites, because of its high performance, nontoxic chemical monopropellant and benign storage characteristics. MPUC pushes the envelope of existing propulsion technologies by significantly increasing propellant storage density to provide &gt;770 N-s total impulse and a thrust of 100 mN at 193 s specific impulse with an input power of ~3 W in a propulsion unit that fits entirely within a 0.5U volume plus hockey puck of a 3U CubeSat. MPUC uses a nontoxic propellant, with no special measures required for long-term storage. System pressurant is a self-pressurizing liquid, also used to provide cold-gas attitude control. MPUC provides a highly competitive total impulse in a small volume package, with a system lifetime estimated to be at least 3 years.BENEFIT:The baseline 0.5U MPUC offers CubeSats and other small satellites a complete propulsion system capability sufficient for significant orbital maneuvers with high impulse per unit volume. The propellant has no handling, storage, or operational restrictions beyond those of the CubeSat, and high thrust provides rapid response. CubeSats and nanosatellites with MPUC thrusters would enable a number of different significant missions for low Earth orbits including orbit raising and\/or deorbiting. The drag makeup capability of MPUC systems would allow low altitude orbits, permitting onboard sensors to operate at lower altitude. MPUC would improve mission affordability for multiple CubeSats, since several CubeSats with MPUC could be launched from a single low-cost booster and maneuvered to other orbits, then later de-orbited. Note that MPUC is easily scalable to smaller or larger sizes, depending on mission and payload requirements, by changing the tank volume. Thus, the MPUC thruster provides a compact, non-hazardous, propulsion technology solution made available in a family of sizes that can meet the differing needs of users in DOD, NASA, industry, and academia for CubeSat and nanosatellite missions."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Busek proposes to develop a Hall thruster operating on chemical propellant(s). This fuel flexible thruster would ultimately be paired with a chemical rocket to produce an efficient multi-mode propulsion (MMP) system. The ultimate goal is a single propellant shared by the Hall thruster and the high thrust chemical rocket. In Phase I, Busek will perform fundamental analysis, performance, plume testing and supporting system level studies. Proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept will be performed using several propellant and oxidizer simulants of interest. Propellants candidates include; the monopropellant hydrazine (N2H4), nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) the oxidizer used in hydrazine and MMH bi-propellant thrusters and the green monopropellant AF-M315E. Busek will characterize prototype thruster concepts, designed to enhance propellant utilization and therefore thrust efficiency. In Phase II, Busek will measure performance and plume characteristics of improved hardware to demonstrate thruster capability. These results will be used to design, build, performance test an EDU thruster to raise the maturity level to TRL-5 at the end of the Phase II.BENEFIT:The proposed MMP system would be used for National Security space assets, hybrid GEO telecom satellites and NASA missions. The flexible fuel Hall thruster as part of an MMP system offers DoD and commercial users the option of a fast, impulsive burn to achieve operational status quickly or threat avoidance. The Hall thruster fueled by chemical propellant and operating at specific impulse greater than 2000s (already demonstrated on some chemical propellants) provides fuel efficiency for orbit topping, station keeping and other maneuvers that are not time critical. The DoD and NRO have recently begun an earnest effort to understand the potential of high-power EP for national assets such as AEHF, GPS, WGS, SBIRS, and reconnaissance satellites. Equipping such assets with EP would allow dual-manifest launches and LEO injections in the majority of cases, saving hundreds of millions of dollars across constellations."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To address the Air Force need for a noncontact full-field real-time strain measurement system, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Fast Full-Field Strain Measurement (3F-SM) system. This proposed system is based on a shearography technique with an instant phase shifting procedure and exploits a tunable shear interferometer which matches system sensitivity to the expected strain range. Specifically, the innovation in system design will enable measurements of in- and out-of-plane strains and airflow wavefront associated with extreme thermal and acoustic loading conditions. The airflow wavefront data are used for correcting strain maps. Thus, the 3F-SM system offers noncontacting 3D full-field strain assessment on high-temperature metallic and nonmetallic aerospace structures, which directly addresses the Air Force critical need for verification and validation of computational methods and models used for structural analysis, design, and reliability assessment. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of a lab prototype by accurately full-field mapping strain distributions in thermal and mechanically loaded specimens. In Phase II, POC plans to develop, and deliver a fully operational standalone 3F-SM system, and work closely with the Air Force to demonstrate its performance on component-level tests at combined thermo-acoustic-mechanical loads, to reach technology readiness level (TRL)-6.BENEFIT:In addition to full-field strain measurements of aerospace structures for military hypersonic vehicles, the 3F-SM system can be used for inspection of composite materials and parts in land-based propulsion and power-generation systems, particularly in the automotive, boating, and wind energy industries to find disbonds, delaminations, and voids. Replacement of metal parts by composite structures in key military and civilian applications increases performance, reduces corrosion and cost, increases life, and saves fuel. The weakness of composite materials lies in their multilayer structure. Hidden defects can lead to total mechanical failure of the parts. Thus, 100% inspection of composite elements is required for crucial applications. The proposed 3F-SM technique applied to nondestructive evaluation of composite structures will, therefore, bring immediate benefits."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:A cooperative small business and university research and development program is proposed to begin development of a robust, non-contacting, digital image correlation based, full-field strain measurement system for high temperature applications. The Phase I studies will demonstrate that a robust high temperature digital image correlation system (HTDICS) can be developed that is capable of acquiring full field deformation measurements (a) over a range of temperatures from room temperature to 1800F and higher, (b) over the same range of temperatures while subjected to different loading rates, including high levels of broadband acoustic loading and (c) at near real-time or at real time rates for immediate visualization of the deformation fields and potentially control of portions of the experiment.BENEFIT:Development of an HTDICS capable of acquiring full-field measurements at high temperature in quasi-real time will provide unprecedented ability for investigators to monitor progressive damage accumulation. This will improve understanding of the evolution processes prevalent in modern material systems subjected to aggressive environmental conditions, resulting in a more efficient (e.g. cost effective) life cycle testing environment without service interruptions. Furthermore, if HTDICS measurements can be acquired in real time, then it offers the potential for real-time control of experiments so that the environment can be altered in response to material changes in a manner that would increase understanding of the damage progression processes. Of course, the ability to acquire real time deformation measurements has broader implications regarding the ability to perform experiments with feedback control based on direct measurements of material response, a possibility that has hitherto been unattainable. Finally, when a structure (e.g. hypersonic vehicle\/structure) is subjected to higher rate excitation\/loading, then the ability to obtain near real time measurements provides investigators with the ability to modify the excitation so that structural failure does not occur."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) developers have limited marketplace options for motor speed controllers. The largest commercial controllers are generally limited to below 12 kW and battery voltages of less than 50 V, Although these are well suited to 800 Class helicopters and Giant scale fixed-wing aircraft, they are not powerful enough for larger UAV development. A few high-power options exist up to 25 kW, though they are substantially heavier with less modularity and selection. To scale up to higher powers, UAV designers are often forced to utilize industrial controllers, which are not packaged for minimal weight and flight capability. To address this need for expanded controller options, this proposal outlines a modular, open architecture motor controller system comprising a main control module, recommended I\/O module, and interchangeable power stage modules. In the Phase I effort, PCKA will develop and demonstrate initial modules in a complete motor control solution through a combination of modeling, simulation, analysis, and hardware prototyping. The proposed solution will have open access to the motor control software and logic with a software infrastructure that enables users without embedded systems experience to utilize the system while also allowing advanced users the capability to fully customize the controls. BENEFIT:The proposed modular, open architecture motor controller system offers several benefits to UAV developers, the first commercialization opportunity that this SBIR will target, including: (1) reduced development time and cost due to the availability of a common control platform with complete and open control software examples, (2) better opportunities to optimize the platform performance and capabilities due to the expanded range of current \/ voltage options as well as the ability to tailor the needed peripheral communications options to the platform, and (3) the ability to rapidly implement custom control algorithms to meet particular platform or mission needs. In addition to the direct benefits to UAV developers in both the military and commercial markets, there is potential for application with minor adaptation in a wide range of other applications that require motor controllers in the target voltage and current ranges including: (1) terrestrial and marine vehicles, (2) industrial automation, (3) autonomous robotics, and (4) mobile power generation units."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:IR Telemetrics will leverage its existing data acquisition technology to design, build, and demonstrate a Compact, High Channel Count, High Frequency, Rotating Data Acquisition and Transmission System. The modular, scale-able system will digitize with over 18-bit resolution and a minimum 300 kSPS sample rate and be able to spin at over 25,000 rpm. Data transmission will be accomplished with a 2-way wireless transceiver with real-time streaming data storage onto an external PC. Power will be sent to the transmitter by way of inductive power coils, eliminating the need for batteries inside the unit. This package occupies a 3&quot; by 3&quot; cylindrical space. A 4-channel unit will be used to demonstrate the functionality and modularity of the system prior to full 300+ channel system development during Phase II.BENEFIT:It is anticipated that the developed system will be used to serve IR Telemetrics current customer base in Internal Combustion Engine development and expand their capability into gas, steam, and wind turbine engine development. The system will allow IR Telemetrics to offer higher density channel count and higher sampling rate than its current offering. IR Telemetrics believes that this will be immediately applicable after Phase I development and that full Phase II development will offer an even broader opportunity for commercialization."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In response to the Turbine Research Facility (AFRL) need for a compact, rapid, wide bandwidth, rotating data acquisition system, scalable to high-channel count, SARA, Inc. is proposing to develop an innovative system architecture making use of COTS 24 bit digitizers. We have successfully completed the Phase 1 (feasibility and brassboard) and are presently under contract in Phase 2 (prototype development) with PEO STRI for the development of a similar instrument consisting in a launchable instrumented mortar designed to diagnose the optical properties of ground-to-air High Energy Lasers in flight. The ruggedized design of the system can withstand high g accelerations (tested to 11,000 gs) and is instrumented with 250 on-board optical sensors which are sampled simultaneously during flight for up to six seconds at kilohertz rates. The serialized data is transmitted to ground in a digital format during flight and prior to impact. In the present project, capitalizing on the experiences learned in the development of this system and its proprietary software, we propose to expand its techniques and capabilities, and present a low risk and proven path to the development of a simple, rugged, scalable, high bandwidth DAQ system capable of achieving and exceeding the needed requirements.BENEFIT:The technology developed under this program would result in Improved operational diagnostics and in-situ life-cycle monitoring of critical rotating infrastructure. Aircraft and rotorcraft subsystems (turbines, wings, etc.) are frequently retired and replaced long before their useful life because the processes for identifying long-term component fatigue currently cost more than simply replacing the part long before its utility is exhausted. Improved monitoring processes, aided by an in-situ multi-channel rotating DAQ may enable extended life cycles of aircraft parts, saving tens of thousands of dollars for every thousand dollars invested in a monitoring system. The flight-data recorder industry would also benefit from the development of the proposed technology: compact data-acquisition that can monitor hundreds of channels and survive an airplane crash will add value to forensic reconstruction of aircraft-event failure. Aircraft engine parts and manufacturing is a $181 billion per year industry, encompassing new and replacement engines worldwide. About 80% of the industry is in replacement engines for otherwise serviceable aircraft. Boeing, GE, Lockheed Martin, Rolls-Royce, Northrop-Grumman, and United Technologies (through Pratt &amp; Whitney) control almost all of this market. All but Rolls-Royce are American companies. A potential in-situ diagnostic capability that could save a modest 5% in fuel costs and diagnose the performance of an engine so that its average end-of-life service increases by 20% would be of immense financial interest: extending the life of the engine saves the industry roughly the same percentage in cost as it does in service lifetime; meaning the industry could save $36B \/ year in engine replacements, and annual savings in aggregate fuel costs reaching the low billions of dollars."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In order to address the expanding need for high fidelity, wide bandwidth data acquisition for an increasing number of sensors in high speed rotating environments, Progeny Systems proposes a reliable, ultra-compact data acquisition system that advances the state of the art using cutting edge components and a novel architecture that is modular, scalable, and easy to install. The proposed system, called the Compact Scalable Data Acquisition System, employs a highly configurable design that can interface with, signal condition, and simultaneously sample up to 480 sensor channels at greater than 300kS\/s. The approach overcomes the limitations associated with the inability to pass large quantities of wires through analog slip rings. The proposed system supports both high channel count and high bandwidth requirements without necessitating any modification to the existing 300-wire slip ring or hub cover plate. The design significantly reduces the required slip ring wire count, enabling application to higher RPM systems.BENEFIT:Existing data acquisition approaches for rotating sensor measurements utilize high wire count analog slip rings and non-rotating external signal conditioning and digitization. The slip ring limits the quantity of sensors that can be passed to the DAQ at any given time, resulting in costly rig tear down for measurement reconfiguration. Passing raw sensor data through the slip ring and over long able lengths results in added noise and signal degradation. The CS-DAQ, embedded in the rotating shaft, provides access to all sensor data without costly rig tear down, while improving measurement quality."

The UAVs will be required to perform weapons delivery and RF functions, including wide-area search and track, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and communications functions. The UAVs will be carried in, and launched from a mothership and possess the range capability to return to a safe recovery point. Innovative low cost aerostructural designs that efficiently integrate RF antennas into the primary aircraft structure offers potential to achieve mission objectives at reduced weight and drag. Phase I objective is to produce a conceptual design of an air launched ISR UAV including reconfiguration concept, structural arrangement, adaptive structure concepts and antenna integration definition. Antenna performance projections are also developed.BENEFIT:Ultra lightweight aero-structures that integrate lightweight low cost RF antennas represents a significant value to multiple government agencies, military branches, and foreign countries and civilian users when applied to air, land and marine vehicles. For UAV missions, the ability to reconfigure from air-launch configuration to efficient cruise and loiter configurations coupled with a large adaptive wing will improve mission performance for a range of missions including ISR and weapons delivery.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Quantum Technology Sciences (Quantums) goal for this project is to develop a preliminary Line of Detection (LOD) sensor system design based on proprietary technology using a seismic-acoustic linear transducer cable sensor that will meet all relevant system requirements. The three technical objectives that support achieving this goal are: 1) Document all requirements necessary to complete the Phase I system design; 2) Design a practical linear sensor system to meet or exceed relevant requirements; and 3) Conduct a study that determines the designs feasibility, describes expected performance against requirements, and recommends a preliminary design as the starting point for Phase II. The objectives will be accomplished in six tasks over the 9-month period of performance. Over the past decade, Quantum has developed a family of seismic-acoustic sensor systems for security monitoring and surveillance for both government and commercial applications. However, these systems were designed to detect and classify specific sources of interest (humans on foot, land vehicles, motorized boats, underground tunnel activity) at significant distances from the sensor. Experiments from 2004 to 2007 with the linear transducer cable showed that an electronic tripwire sensor is very feasible. Quantums Phase I work provide a complete system design for demonstration in Phase II. BENEFIT:A narrow width LOD system will complete Quantums first family of commercial security monitoring and surveillance seismic-acoustic sensor systems. The other three systems in the family are focused on expanding the awareness zone around an asset or beyond a perimeter. Their value is in detecting, classifying, locating, and reporting potential intruders well before they reach the perimeter fence or wall, so security teams can respond proactively to prevent an intrusion from occurring. The LOD sensor system called for in the AF151-074 topic is exactly the kind of system Quantum would like to design, develop, build, test, demonstrate, and then begin transitioning into its commercial line of systems. Having a very narrow electronic tripwire system to complement Quantums current beyond-the-perimeter systems will offer commercial and government customers more options for security systems for their physical security applications. Projected revenue estimates are that Quantum LOD systems in Phase III could contribute up to 10% ($4M) of the revenue in calendar year 2018 and grow from there."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This proposal details a line of detection (LOD) system to be used for human intrusion detection systems protecting critical Air Force assets on flightlines, launch facilities, and weapon storage areas. A high probability of detection (Pd) is required for targets including people walking, running, crawling, and jumping and vehicles traveling at high or low speed when crossing through the LOD; however, the width of the detection area for the LOD shall be less than 1.5 meters (threshold) or 1 meter (objective). The LOD shall have a low probability of false or nuisance alarms and shall not detect people or vehicles outside the 1.5 meter width. The key challenge is that many other activities take place on the flight line, including movement of aircraft and vehicles right up to the LOD. A second challenge is that no aspect of the detection system should interfere in anyway with normal flightline operations. To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI), along with our collaborators proposes to develop LC&amp;F, an integrated distributed sensor array narrow width Line of Detection (LOD) for Narrow-width line protection of flight lines, launch facilities, and other key assets.BENEFIT:The need for perimeter security is increasing due to a constant risk of terrorist attacks, large-scale illegal immigration, increased crime and violent anti-government protests as a result of international and local issues. Theft at Brussels airport in March 2013, other security breaches at Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in November 2012, Utahs St. George Municipal Airport in July 2012, Y-12 National Security Complex in August 2012, and the Philadelphia International Airport in March 2012 are just few examples of the increasing number of threats. The demand for security is increasing as these breaches have raised criticism. The demand is not limited to any extent; it is a necessity now-a-days for all the verticals including Transportation; Critical infrastructures such as nuclear plants, chemical industries, and oil and gas facilities; Commercial buildings; Govt. and Defense; and for all Sensitive areas, has also shown increase in the demand for security technologies and systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:AOSense proposes to develop a model that calculates the response of a cold-atom IMU subjected to harsh environmental effects including radiation, magnetic fields, and acceleration\/rotation. These simulations will predict navigational accuracy of cold-atom sensors in real environments, informing the development of future generations of strategic-grade cold-atom IMUs. The resulting software package will allow the user to predict navigational figures of merit based upon environmental input variables. In Phase II the model will be validated with laboratory tests and extended to include approaches for mitigating adverse environmental factors. Future work will also include severe-environment testing of components used in atom-optic sensors, further informing the simulation as well as the design of future sensors.BENEFIT:Inertial navigation systems are a key asset for cases in which GPS is either unavailable or actively denied. Recent efforts to reduce military and civilian reliance on GPS have greatly increased demand for inertial sensors. Atom-optical inertial sensors have demonstrated superior performance over conventional inertial devices owing to the intrinsic stability of atomic systems. Central to making cold-atom sensors practical is their ability to operate in harsh dynamic and radiation environments. This program will provide an analysis package capable of predicting sensor performance and degradation under user-defined operating conditions. Such a tool will provide valuable insight into design strategies that optimize sensor performance, size, weight, and cost for a given environment."

To enable this configuration, thin and deployable solar arrays must supplant standard rigid solar panels that occupy too much volume within the fairing while stowed. For this proposed effort, Vanguard Space Technologies and Composite Technology Development propose an innovative deployable solar array system that can readily stow into a small envelope and that can deploy to meet the spacecraft power requirements. The approach combines Vanguards thin and flexible solar array technology with CTDs composite boom deployment mechanisms to render very high specific power and stowed volumetric power solar arrays that can meet the demands of 15 year on-orbit lifetimes in medium earth orbit.BENEFIT:The proposed deployable solar array systems would have wide applicability to both DoD and commercial spacecraft operating in MEO orbit and further."

To provide service to multiple satellite bands, a reconfigurable radio front-end that can support all possible GNSS\/communication bands with simultaneous reception is needed. MaXentric proposes a Universal GNSS Receiver capable of tuning to multiple GNSS\/Comm bands with a custom reconfigurable receiver to address this demand.BENEFIT:GPS has become a standard service for both DoD applications and commercial technology such as cellular. Current GPS technology is only capable of servicing a few bands with receivers with minimal reconfigurable capabilities.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Software Defined Radios rely on digital FPGAs and\/or high performance general purpose processors to realize flexible transmitter\/receiver solutions that can adapt to various modulation schemes, waveforms, and even mission functions. However, achieving similar flexibility in the complementary RF Front End (RF-FE) poses a much bigger challenge. RF solutions are often designed to specific frequency plans; attempts to achieve versatility require multiple implementations of the design and increase C-SWaP. What is missing from the RF design tool box is a way to realize high performance, complex RF-FE subsystems using a common, reconfigurable component mirroring the advantages of digital FPGAs. The technology would enable low cost, reconfigurable transceiver systems. CEI proposes to leverage its extensive experience with reconfigurable RF and transceiver design to identify, develop, and evaluate reconfigurable RF-FE network architectures enabling frequency band agnostic, SDR based multi-band navigation and communication handheld solutions. With a focus on minimizing SWaP, CEI will conduct a comprehensive comparative assessment of COTS-based reconfigurable RF-FE network architectures and make a recommendation about the best approach. CEI will evaluate architecture options with respect to complexity, processing load, ease of on-the-fly reconfigurability, and suitability for an SDR-based GNSS receiver and communication device.BENEFIT:CEI has developed software and hardware technologies for a variety of government programs, and the team has transitioned over 37 products to production for use in DoD and Government systems. CEI also has experience commercializing technology developed under Government-funded programs. Products are packaged as COTS items, listed on a catalog price sheet, supported with technical application notes and marketing materials, and made available for sale to both the commercial and Government markets. CEI will promote technologies developed under this effort as part of its standard commercial product marketing and sales activities. As further evidence of CEIs success with commercialization of SBIR technology, the Small Business Administration presented CEI with the Tibbetts Award. This prestigious award is presented to small businesses that represent excellence in achieving the mission and goals of the SBIR and STTR program, stimulate technological innovation, and increase commercialization of Federal research. The reconfigurable RF-FE technology resulting from this program opens up many opportunities for both military and commercial transitions. Dynamically reconfigurable RF modules lower the total ownership cost of systems through improved device commonality, reliability, adaptability, and operational readiness. CEI is teamed with a prime contract who will assist CEI throughout Phase I to identify military transition opportunities for reconfigurable RF beyond the comm\/GNSS application identified in the topic. One promising area is EW; applying RF-FE technology to this area results in solutions with enhanced situational awareness, interoperability, and performance to meet evolving threats. A reconfigurable RF technology insertion enhances an EW systems threat detection performance in congested environments, improves interoperability with Blue Force communication and other EW equipment, enhances waveform agility for effective threat defeat, improves reliability, and reduces acquisition cost through part count reduction and reuse of a common RF front end. CEI is also teamed with a leading RF component supplier who is supporting CEI with insight into device-level realization of the concept architectures. The company has extensive insight into both the military and commercial markets and is a market leader in RF solutions including cell phone devices and programmable filters. By collaborating with this company throughout Phase I, II, and III, reconfigurable RF-FE technology will migrate into device-level product offerings."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This proposal is fully responsive to this Air Force SBIR programs objective to develop a network-based security overlay for military GPS receivers that provides enhanced security for GPS Critical Program Information (CPI) while relieving GPS receivers from burdensome protection measures. The Information Assurance (IA) architecture employed by the current SAASM and MGUE receivers impose significant increase in the size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) of these receivers due to the need to store the CPI permanently (or for long-periods) in the receivers themselves and hence the need for expensive (SWaP-C) anti-tamper (AT) measures to protect the CPI. In this SBIR program, Mayflower proposes to develop an innovative system architecture termed TNSA which will minimize the exposure of the CPI, namely GPS cryptographic algorithms and keys, needed for cryptographic processing of Y-Code and M-Code signals by taking advantage of the tactical network infrastructure which is likely be tightly integrated with the GPS navigation systems in the military applications in the near future. Mayflower will perform feasibility analysis of the proposed TNSA system concept in the Phase I program, perform a trade-off between the proposed security system architecture with other candidate security overlay concepts. Mayflower will also develop a preliminary plan for detailed design, implementation and demonstration of the selected TNSA system configuration on a prototype hardware platform in a follow-on Phase II program. BENEFIT:The proposed TNSA technology development will result in a MGUE receiver architecture and concept of operation that will reduce the cost of the MGUE significantly while improving the security of the Information Assurance components."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The ultimate goals of this proposed effort are to automate terrestrial EMI emitter localization and identification (including accessing legacy databases and websites for frequency and flight information and plotting on Google Earth), realizing significant manpower savings; dramatically shorten EMI response time; provide improved situational awareness; recommend unautomatable investigative and mitigation steps; provide capabilities for the system to evolve without our involvement; and offer increased support for adversarial scenarios, both real and during training. The Phase I research goals are to understand terrestrial EMI emitter localization and identification processes; elicit required investigative and mitigation knowledge; understand the steps, data sources, and other resources used; investigate integration requirements; elaborate the heuristics, algorithms, and techniques for automating terrestrial EMI investigation; analyze them as to their feasibility in several dimensions; develop the Phase II system design; and further prove the feasibility of the techniques through prototype development and testing with real (prerecorded) ALPS data. This work follows naturally on our MIDAS and RAPTOR systems for 22 SOPS, the latter involving EMI detection, classification, and identifying space-based emitters. Our proposal includes ISS, developers of ALPS, and DF&amp;NN, developers of ABNet, a component interfaced to ALPS that detects and classifies AFSCN RTS EMI.BENEFIT:The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, the AFSCN itself, specifically 22 SOPS. We are already in the process of operationally fielding MIDAS, so we already understand the various processes required to transition Phase II SBIR software to an operational, supported system, and transitioning this proposed system can piggyback on the MIDAS transition. Similarly, our subcontractor ISS has fielded ALPS at 22 SOPS; like MIDAS, ALPS was another system that transitioned from an SBIR. This proposed project can leverage this as well. Finally, our current RAPTOR project is similarly planned to follow on MIDASs and ALPSs transition paths. This proposed efforts techniques are applicable to tracking down EMI with respect to any RF system, including more conventional radio communications and radar systems. Thus it would be useful to commercial radio communications services providers and all the military Services to track down sources of EMI; moreover, it would prove useful in the Electronic Warfare (EW) domain for detecting, classifying, and localizing jamming sources."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Tau Technologies proposes to automate the current Air Force Satellite Control Network Link Protection System (ALPS) to facilitate the rapid dissemination of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) sources to the relevant commands centers. RFI emitter locations and related information will be automatically distributed via eXtensible Markup Language (XML) messages sent over any available computer network. This situational awareness is necessary to take corrective actions in severe RFI situations. In addition, we propose to design a Cognitive Radio-based Spectrum Sensing and classification system that will identify and precisely locate RFI sources, using direction finding (DF) and differential time-of-arrival techniques from multiple locations. This system will be compact and easily transportable. Tau will also develop a simulation model to accurately predict the effects of RFI on a satellite communication pass. The results of this model will permit more effective contact scheduling, maximizing the communication opportunities of the AFSCN ground stations.BENEFIT:This technology can be used at all AFSCN ground stations, and indeed at any satellite ground station be it military or commercial. The proliferation of RF communication devices, such as cell phones, WiFi, WiMax, amateur radio transmissions, improperly shielded electronic devices, and intentional jammers, to name but a few, has saturated the radio spectrum and made RFI detection a necessity. The situational awareness provided by this system can be used to map RFI emitters and undertake corrective actions. The uses of this system are limitless."

This Phase I SBIR will establish the feasibility of developing an ultra-stable, compact, robust, integrated laser source suitable for atom-based precision navigation and timing (PNT) systems. AdvRs design is enabled by capitalizing on well-commercialized, low-noise telecom components with high reliability and declining costs which will help to drive the widespread deployment of this system. The key innovation is the combination of current telecom-based fiber laser and modulator technology with periodically-poled waveguide technology to produce tunable laser light at rubidium D1 and D2 wavelengths (and expandable to other alkalis) using second harmonic generation (SHG). With this technology, multiple channels can be independently tuned to produce the fields needed in PNT applications.BENEFIT:The proposed project will develop integrated, compact laser that can be used as a source for atom-based precision navigation and timing (PNT) systems. In addition to the development of GPS-free systems, atomic based inertia sensors, and precision time keeping applications, this technology will have a broad range of uses including remote sensing for environmental monitoring, precision spectroscopy, high-security free-space communication, and basic research."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) has been a central technology to the armed forces and the Air Force since their inception, and PNTs importance only stands to grow as we forge ahead in the 21st century. Just as todays state of the art PNT harness the quantum states of light in laser based sensors, the next levels of fidelity in both timing and inertial measurement units (IMUs) will harness the quantum states of matter in atomic sensors. To realize a field deployable atomic sensor the diode laser systems that drive them must mature. The biggest technical challenge to the laser system is keeping them locked to an atomic transition over the long term. We propose to develop methods to eliminate laser mode hops through laser design and optical monitoring to solve this technical challenge.BENEFIT:There exist a the wide range of fast-light and cold-atom applications that are beginning to move from the laboratory into the field. These applications all need laser systems similar to that proposed here. Gravity sensors have security applications such as sensing of hidden tunnels or hidden intruders behind walls or in tunnels. Inertial sensors enable precise global navigation without the need for GPS. Quantum computers could enable more efficient search algorithms and are important in cryptography. New magnetic sensors could be used for detection of brain waves in medical imaging, detection of submarines, underwater mines, and other forms of surveillance. Atomic clocks are needed for increased demands on network synchronization for Internet data transmission and 3G networks. Ultra-cold ion and electron beams could improve resolution for ion milling machines and electron beam microscopy."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to improve OPIR follow-on ISR tipping and cueing; dramatically shorten the associated response time to new OPIR events; and improve ISR collection quality, resulting in: improved analyst performance; better-quality schedules; and higher, and better utilization of sensors. The goals of the Phase I research are to understand the OPIR tipping and cueing domain; elicit required planning knowledge related to follow-on sensor tasking from expert satellite image analysts; understand the resources, tasks, and constraints relating to the ISR scheduling problem; investigate integration requirements; define the appropriate performance metrics; elaborate the heuristics, algorithms, and techniques for improved OPIR tipping\/cueing as well as to analyze them as to their feasibility in several dimensions and against the metrics; develop the Phase II system design; and further prove the feasibility of the techniques through prototype development and demonstrations in realistic scenarios. Stottler Henke has developed significant technologies and techniques for both the planning and scheduling parts of the problem AND we have teamed with actual analysts from BOTH the defense and intelligence communities who have extensive experience with the tipping and cueing process.BENEFIT:The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, this countrys ISR satellite system itself. The work is also applicable to other ISR assets such as UAVs. By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational systems, we will provide the DoD and intelligence communities with a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed PROACT. Beyond these there are several commercialization possibilities available in the Government and private sector. The algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Air Force, Navy, and MDA sensor customers interested in sensor management. As mentioned in this proposal, commercial companies now offer satellite sensor services and these are potential targets as well. There are other commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler. We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains. The additional capabilities developed for OPIR tipping and cueing can be synergistically marketed to the same clients. For example, the bottleneck avoidance algorithm proposed as fully developed here would be applicable to many Aurora customers. We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) sensors are a key part of a developing mission area supported by the Air Force and the Intelligence Community to provide worldwide, persistent surveillance of missile launches and other operations. These sensors operate in the SWIR and MWIR spectral regions. While this spectral range has been valuable for decades to the meteorological community, it is always used in combination with visible, longwave IR, or thermal IR observations to characterize clouds. The meteorological community may benefit from the OPIR technology as it offers the potential to cover more of the globe and its higher temporal resolution may allow for better characterization of some environmental phenomena. In addition to these operational specifications, the addition of spectral information could augment the current suite of meteorological satellites. With a combined modeling and algorithm development effort, we propose to investigate the SWIR\/MWIR region with the goal of identifying an optimal standalone OPIR channel set that maximizes the information content in support of cloud property retrievals. The spectral characteristics of the channels chosen for the proposed algorithm will become the starting point for the definition of the initial collection requirements for the OPIR sensor and the platform it is deployed on.BENEFIT:The US Government Accounting Office (GAO), in their latest High Risk Report titled Mitigating Gaps in Weather Satellite Data, says that the continuity in US weather-satellite data is at risk. The programs intended to replace aging satellite systems have had to reduce functionality and slip planned launch dates due, in part, to cost increases, missed milestones, technical problems, and management challenges. With concerns surrounding our weather and climatological observations, new technologies have an opportunity to make an impact. It has been shown many times through Observational System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) studies that improved cloud and water vapor retrievals dramatically improve the skill scores of weather forecasts. We anticipate, through the development of an accurate cloud retrieval algorithm applicable to OPIR data, the generation of improved inputs to forecasting models such as, CDFS-II. The real-time and persistent nature of the OPIR data stream will provide improved cloud products for forecasting models through OPIRs improved temporal resolution and wider global coverage. Commercial applications will come in the form of providing improved cloud observations to the meteorological community who use this environmental intelligence data in their forecasting models."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:There is a critical need to research and develop new ways to better determine what satellite orbital events are most critical to monitor and how such methods can be made scalable to serve the future needs of the operational system with a growing catalog of up to 500,000 objects. To support this endeavor, Numerica proposes the development of a new software suite for space object conjunction assessment. Numerica&apos;s multi-faceted approach would provide solutions from the sensor level to the system level that (i) generate improved orbital estimates and more realistic covariances directly from sensor observations; (ii) perform scalable all-on-all conjunction filtering to quickly and cheaply rule out infeasible conjunctions; (iii) compute a more accurate probability of collision acting on the most critical conjunction pairs; and (iv) display the highest risk conjunction events in a risk assessment visualization tool. Phase I will focus primarily on algorithm and software development and will exploit Numerica&apos;s existing mature software suite of astrodynamics algorithms. Numerica will also leverage its experience processing real and simulated data from the SSN. A transition plan for integrating the conjunction assessment software suite into an operationally relevant system will also be developed in Phase I.BENEFIT:The envisioned sensor-to-system-level conjunction assessment software suite would provide the analyst with advanced tools needed to support conjunction assessment screening on a growing space catalog and ultimately to serve the future needs of the SSA mission. In particular, Numerica&apos;s multi-faceted approach would (i) send more reliable input to downstream conjunction assessment algorithms; (ii) scale to a future catalog with as many as half-a-million objects; (iii) perform conjunction assessment screening out to seven days or longer and reduce the false alarm rate; and (iv) improve analyst productivity by displaying the output in a tool that would allow the analyst to more efficiently monitor the highest risk conjunction events and recommended courses of action. The primary transition path of the proposed conjunction assessment algorithms and software is to ARCADE and to an eventual service pack of the JSpOC Mission System. To facilitate this transition, Numerica is partnering with Intelligent Software Solutions (ISS) and will integrate the software into their Continuous Anomalous Orbital Situation Determination (CAOS-D) UDOP in an extended program. A secondary transition path would be to a commercial customer such as Lockheed Martin or AGI, both of whom are attempting to develop commercial versions of the JSpOC in order to complement and augment services currently provided by the Government.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Satellite operators heavily rely on the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) to maintain an updated catalog of all tracked space objects and to regularly perform conjunction analyses to predict potential on-orbit collisions. In the near future, the number of tracked objects is projected to grow by an order of magnitude. The corresponding increase in collision warnings produced by the existing conjunction analysis process will easily overwhelm the current system. The three keys to a collision prediction process that can successfully handle the projected growth in data are: accurate data representation, scalable screening techniques, and automated decision processes. Stellar Science proposes a new conjunction analysis system based on the Adaptive Entropy-based Gaussian-mixture Information Synthesis (AEGIS) method, a mature technology that has been demonstrated to accurately propagate and update orbit estimates and uncertainties and compute collision probabilities. We will combine the AEGIS method with innovative techniques based on spatiotemporal data indexing to screen for potential conjunctions, and build an automated decision framework based on machine learning algorithms to provide JSpOC with advanced capabilities to handle its future SSA missions.BENEFIT:Timely and accurate conjunction filtering is a critical need of the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). The collision warnings produced by the JSpOC are of critical importance in protecting U.S. and allied spacecraft against destructive collisions, and in protecting the lives of astronauts during space flight. By improving the accuracy of how orbit uncertainty is represented, propagated, and updated, the proposed collision prediction system will produce fewer false collision warnings, without missing high-risk conjunction events. Combined with conjunction filter techniques based on spatiotemporal data structures, the proposed system will accurately and efficiently process a catalog of 100,000 objects and screen for high probability conjunction events. Finally, automated screening using machine learning techniques will further eliminate the low-risk events, and reduce the number of conjunctions requiring manual review by operators and consideration of risk-mitigating actions."

Currently available converters have shortcomings in areas of power density, tolerance to radiation and wide operating temperatures, and excessive development cost. We propose to develop a high specific power converter that is compatible with spacecraft operational environments and is modular for broad applicability. To achieve these goals, we will utilize advanced components having intrinsic environmental compliance, thorough design and analysis, and a simple architecture that can be adapted for a range of voltage conversion needs. We will develop the complete power converter, including power components, supporting analog and microcontroller electronics, and thermal management hardware. During Phase I we will prove feasibility with design and subscale prototype demonstration of a modular 5 kW boost converter topology that can be cascaded for higher power levels; is suitable for large satellites; and is also easily adaptable to lower power, step-down, and multiple output converters. During Phase II we will design, build, and demonstrate a full-scale power converter sized for a specific spacecraft application and execute our commercialization plan to address broad future needs.BENEFIT:The successful completion of the proposed work will establish a complete and modular power converter design that will improve radiation hardness, enable operation over a wide temperature range, reduce size and mass, and streamline application to a variety of spacecraft power conversion needs.

The primary problems are the structural instability and the low electronic conductivity of the Li rich transition metal oxide based cathode materials during the charge-discharge cycling operation. Specifically, during the charge-discharge cycling, the mobility and dissolution of the transition metals and loss of oxygen leads to phase transition within the cathode materials to structures with lower capacity. Lynntech proposes an advanced Li ion cathode material that will address the structural instability issue and improve electronic conductivity for achieving high rate capabilities (charge-discharge at &gt; 1 C rate). The Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of Lynntechs advanced cathode materials for achieving the energy density and cycling stability requirements for the satellite application in laboratory scale cells. During the Phase II project, Lynntech will scale up the synthesis of the cathode materials, optimize the performance and demonstrate the operation of prototype cells to meet the DoD requirements.BENEFIT:The proposed lithium ion batteries with high energy density and improved cycling stability will find applications in both commercial and military markets. Apart from the desired satellite applications, other military applications will include soldier power, communication systems, weapons systems, remote sensors, detection devices, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

(DTI) and MIT Haystack Observatory (MIT) will work together to implement a modern paradigm, where low power transmitters, precision receivers, and discrete antennas are integrated into radar elements which can be readily deployed to meet Incoherent Scattering Radar (ISR) requirements. Through advances in microcircuits and computing power, these elements can be replicated at low cost, fielded in large aperture arrays, and tied together with advanced processing algorithms to achieve the same performance through replicability of a network of Incoherent Scattering Radars (ISRs). These ISRs can be deployed at a reasonable cost, competitive with a single satellite or a small group of conventional radars.BENEFIT:This project will enable the detailed design of a next generation incoherent scatter radar system which is tailored to the needs of the United States Air Force. The design will be scalable in capability and have a significant number of secondary capabilities relevant to specific Air Force missions. Technologies identified, developed, and prototyped in Phase I will be used to directly enable a coherent scatter class radar for demonstration in Phase II. This stage of demonstration will focus on implementation of multiple full scale sub-arrays for transmission and reception."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Over the last several years, ADS has been working closely with the AFRL to develop innovative algorithms specifically to address the information-based surveillance scheduling issues of SSA; with focus on the area of space object DTIC. ADS proposes to leverage two of these matured techniques 1) FISST and 2) ISRHC stochastic optimization to develop a scalable, centralized tasking and scheduling environment for the JSpOC Systems. This new tool will utilize parallelization and net-centric distributed computing to achieve 1000x speedups compared to traditional methods. The new tool will transact messages through ARCADE SOA compliant messaging to enable real-time coordination of surveillance assets, requirements, and operators. In Phase I, ADS will develop a proof-of-concept demonstration that dynamically tasks multiple heterogeneous surveillance systems through three vignettes including: multi-event Remote Proximity Operations at GEO, monitor adversary GEO Transfer, and a LEO Collision. ADS will team with TASC to leverage their validated SSN simulator Lookout to baseline with realistic, current day scheduling requirements; performance metrics; and models for all the JSpOC SSN assets. The resulting Phase 1 demonstration will prove the potential that information-based requirements scheduling is scalable and significantly enhances the JSpOC missions of SSA, DTIC, Combat ID, and Space Control.BENEFIT:Applications of the Finite Set Statistics (FISST) and Information Space Receding Horizon Control (ISRHC) stochastic optimization have the potential to enable evolutionary changes in the way that government intelligence collection agencies implement high value resource allocation. The paradigm shift from revisit rate centric scheduling to information gain could be applied directly and broadly to influence collection strategies in space, air breathing, maritime, and Human Intelligence (HUMINT)\/social-networking domains. Furthermore, these concepts may be further generalized outside purely surveillance intelligence collection fields to address a wide variety of resource contention problems such as routing of airline traffic, genetic engineering, or financial asset management."

Heimdall application components will appropriately score\/prioritize space catalog objects based on covariance, priority, observability, and other factors, and coordinate an efficient sensor observation schedule for SSN assets while encouraging the contributions of non-SSN sensors to the SSA effort. We will develop an ops concept based on sensor participation levels of Scheduled, Tasked and Contributing. Scheduled and Tasked sensors will received optimized observation schedules or object tracking lists from the central algorithms, while Contributing sensors may review and select from a list of desired track objects. All sensors will send observation schedules and confirmed observations and related data to Heimdall to complete the feedback loop for the next scheduling iteration. The team has experience with tasking optimization software, including SSA-specific figures-of-merit, computing observation opportunity information gain, optimizing scheduling algorithms, and integrating software into the JSpOC. Phase I will culminate with a prototype Heimdall Web Application for tasking a network of sensors including actual observations by AGI COMSPOC SSA sensors.BENEFIT:The proposed Heimdall solution architecture and ops concept will provide a modern, centralized, and scalable solution to coordinate and optimize the use of available sensor assets through the ability to configure sensors contributing at various levels, and by providing the tools necessary to properly prioritize observation opportunities and generate optimized tasking schedules. The proposed system will enable responsive, information-based tasking and scheduling of a heterogeneous sensor network that varies not only in sensor capabilities and location, but also by configurable participation and classification levels. By providing feedback interfaces from the sensor sites and a common platform, the authorized sharing of information between sites is enabled for better overall cooperation and for responsive reallocation and tasking by the central planning and tasking component. Tasking and scheduling algorithm performance will enable truly responsive and automated sensor re-tasking at whatever frequency is required based on dynamic object catalog events, sensor status, or changing mission goals and priorities. The proposed solution architecture will enable the network of SSN and non-SSN sensors to meet (and in most cases beat) the Key Performance Parameters described in the SBIR topic and reiterated here for convenience: a) Time from central tasking to acknowledgment of receipt (Goal: 95 percent) c) Time from collect to data delivery (Goal: "

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To meet the current and future power needs of Air Force spacecraft, efficient energy storage systems are necessary to extend mission time, reduce weight, and increase capabilities. Ultracapacitors (also known as supercapacitors or electrochemical capacitors) are paramount in spacecraft applications where pulsed power profiles are expected. Current ultracapacitors have very long cycle life and high charge\/discharge rates, but have relatively low specific energy. Advanced ultracapacitors with high specific energy and specific power over wide operating temperatures are required to support Air Force space missions. Lynntech proposes to develop advanced ultracapacitors by using two-dimensional hybrid electrode materials and ionic liquid based electrolytes to provide high specific energy and function over wide temperature ranges. During the Phase I, Lynntech will develop the electrode and electrolyte components and test cells to demonstrate high specific energy, specific power, long cycle life and operation over wide temperature ranges. During the Phase II, Lynntech will optimize materials and processes, and produce a prototype advanced ultracapacitor.BENEFIT:Advanced ultracapacitors with high specfic energy, high specific power, and wide operating temperatures can provide improved power systems for spacecrafts, portable electronics, tactical vehicles, weapons, and other systems. These properties allow for smaller, lighter devices capable of operating in extreme environments. Specific benefits of this technology for the Air Force include extended mission time, reduced weight, and increased capabilities. The advanced ultracapacitors can be used for numerous medium, high, and pulse-power applications in both military and private sectors. The private sector applications include hybrid\/electric vehicles and consumer electronic devices."

Scientic proposes to develop a high speed, radiation-hardened DAC to be produced on-shore in a trusted semiconductor foundry to meet the data conversion needs of the US Air Force (AF) and other military and aerospace system developers. To accomplish this, Scientic has teamed with Honeywell Aerospace to define a state-of-the-art digital to analog conversion architecture to be implemented in an advanced technology at a trusted foundry. The DAC capabilities described in our proposal will provide direct and significant benefits to satellite communications and other space-borne applications by addressing their demanding requirements on performance, size, weight and power (SWaP). The operational parametric goals for our device are; 12 bit resolution, 2 GSPS sample rate, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 70dB or better, and Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) of 80dB or better. The radiation-hardness goals for the DAC are; Total Ionizing Dose 1e6 rads(Si), Single-Event Upset 1e-10 err\/bit-day, Single-Event Latchup = None, Dose-Rate Upset 1e10 rads(Si)\/s, and Dose-Rate Survivability 1e12 rads(Si)\/s. The DAC will balance the tradeoffs between speed, resolution, noise, and radiation hardness with SWaP reductions.BENEFIT:Successful completion of the three-phase efforts briefly outlined in this proposal will result in a fully qualified, radiation hardened 12 bit, 2GSPS DAC device to satisfy system needs for signal processing. Within the radiation hardened electronics user base, there is a ready market for technology innovations that offer advanced, capable, and reliable radiation hardened devices to address critical component requirements for a wide range of defense, aerospace, and space science applications. This device will have relevance to defense, aerospace, and space science markets with significance to satellite (including micro\/nano-satellite), missile defense, and other strategic defense systems. Specific applications for this device will include navigation, communication, command and control, and data acquisition for defense and commercial satellites, other space flight systems, interceptors, and radar\/antenna arrays. Scientics commercialization strategy seeks to leverage Honeywells unique marketplace knowledge, as well as their integration, fabrication, and distribution expertise to establish a market basis for development and fabrication of the proposed radiation hardened DAC. This approach has particular advantage with respect to, risk reduction, product financing, market penetration, market credibility, manufacturing, production, and distribution. Upon successful completion of this program, Honeywell will be the primary source of production for this device. Honeywell has the capacity to produce and deliver thousands of devices per year. Members of our team have successfully developed numerous advanced radiation hardened devices for space and strategic applications in the past, including a 12-bit, 20 MSPS ADC currently used to support Trident and multiple other programs, a 14-bit, 125MSPS ADC currently undergoing QML qualification, and a 10Gbps multi-protocol SerDes transceiver. Scientic personnel, along with our technology partners, have extensive experience in the DoD market area. This experience has been gained over many years while working at this and previous corporations, both large and small, bringing sophisticated technology to the defense marketplace. For example, working in close cooperation with organizations such as Honeywell Aerospace, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Aeroflex, and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), we have developed and brought to market a number of radiation-hardened electronic devices. In addition Scientic personnel have established working relationships with defense component suppliers such as Kearfott for IMU technology and Rockwell Collins for missile defense interceptor communications applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:We propose to create a low-profile vapor chamber using the ChipChill microfabrication process to remove heat from GaN power amplifiers that dissipate 600W. This heat spreader is required for space applications where thermal densities greater than 62W\/cm2 cannot be removed using traditional spacecraft thermal engineering solutions. This microfabrication process is capable of creating copper structures that encourage delivery of the fluid to and from the hot spots. Corrosion resistant coatings are employed to ensure maximum lifetime of the devices.BENEFIT:This thermal solution for GaN power amplifiers distributes heat from localized hot spots to larger surfaces. This allows traditional thermal management solutions for space systems to be employed. This technology has great benefits for future solid-state power amplifiers. In addition to space hardware, military hardware for terrestrial, sea-based, or airborne platforms have similar requirements for improvement. Each commercial mobile device has a custom heat spreader that could be more effectively designed and fabricated with the freedom provided using the ChipChill microfabrication process."

The research team will design, model, fabricate, test, and analyze OHP-embedded heat spreaders made with innovative material stacks, variable internal surface structures, and three-dimensional channel patterns to meet the challenging thermal requirements of next-generation power amplifiers. Further, the unique material-fluid combinations will be utilized to allow for reliable operation during die attach, die removal, and thermal cycling. The small business will work with prime contractors and defense agencies to ensure the Phase I prototypes have a clear transition path for defense and commercial applications.BENEFIT:Status quo thermal management technologies are unable to transform the ultra-high heat fluxes of solid state power amplifiers to lower levels required by space-based thermal control systems. Power densities of GaN based power amplifiers are expected to exceed 1000 W\/cm2 but spacecraft radiators and heat pipes have orders of magnitude to lower heat flux limits. New technologies are needed to bridge this gap. One promising technology is the Oscillating Heat Pipe or OHP. The OHP has proven ultra-high heat transport capacities and can be made from a wide variety of material-fluid combinations. This research effort will show how the OHP technology can be integrated into complex, thermally efficient material stacks for ultra-low resistance at the chip interface - and ultra high effective lateral thermal conductivity. Successful Phase I will create a new thermal solution to remove the constraints facing the advanced high channel density solid state power amplifiers."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The purpose of the proposed Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is to develop a highly effective heat spreader for future generation high heat flux GaN power amplifiers in satellite systems. Current power amplifiers are limited in output by the heat flux capability of the overall thermal management system. In order to enable higher output devices it is critical to reduce the heat flux on the thermal management system by spreading the heat efficiently across a larger area. ACT proposes a bio-inspired, Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) matched, structural vapor chamber to achieve the desired thermal spreading. Vapor chambers are highly effective heat spreaders that rely on boiling and condensation of a working fluid to spread heat across large areas. The proposed vapor chamber improves upon current vapor chamber technology in three ways. First, the bio-inspired wick structure reduces the liquid pressure drop through the wick structure and enablse significantly higher heat fluxes to be dissipated. Secondly, the vapor chamber materials of construction are CTE-matched to common semiconductor materials. This enables the power amplifiers to be directly attached to the vapor chamber. Finally, ACT proposes a novel internal locking feature to improve the structural integrity of the vapor chamber.BENEFIT:GaN-based solid state power amplifiers (SSPAs) offer the potential for higher power densities which results in significant reductions in size and weight as well as reductions in overall system cost. GaN SSPA technology has the potential to enable low-cost small satellites where current SSPA technology is major restriction. The proposed technology will enable GaN SSPAs to be utilized in current satellite systems by eliminating the need to redesign the entire thermal management system. If successful, the proposed technology would provide a significantly expedited path towards implementation for GaN SPPA technology in satellite systems. The proposed technology is also well-suited for high heat flux terrestrial applications, like high output laser diode cooling, where existing thermal management systems are being pushed to their limits."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:MicroLink Devices, in collaboration with Dr. Scott Messenger at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), proposes to develop an ultra-high efficiency, radiation-hard, six-junction solar cell for application to Air Force space missions. The proposed technology will comprise lattice-matched subcells grown on InP and GaAs substrates that are mechanically attached in a monolithic structure to achieve an AM0 efficiency in excess of 40%. To render the solar cell cost-efficient, epitaxial lift-off (ELO) will be used to separate the epitaxial layers from the InP substrate, allowing it to be reused for multiple growth cycles. The thin epitaxial layers will be attached to the back of the GaAs substrate in the final device structure using an epoxy bonding process. Dr. Messenger, a pioneer in the field of radiation modeling, will perform realistic environment simulations for missions in GEO, MEO and LEO, and the solar cell structure will be optimized for performance in the relevant mission radiation environment.BENEFIT:A successful development program will result in an increase in the efficiency of our multi-junction solar cells. The expected absolute efficiency of the devices ultimately enabled by the proposed technology is at least 40%. The proposed high-efficiency solar cells will be an attractive replacement for existing Ge-based triple-junction solar cells in all applications in which these cells are used. A major potential application is high-efficiency solar cells for use in solar-powered spacecraft, which will meet the needs of NASA, the DoD, other Federal Agencies, and the private sector. Customers of the products would be the makers of solar arrays for spacecraft, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, ATK, and Space Systems Loral. Other applications that would benefit from increased efficiency solar cells include high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) solar-powered aircraft. These aircraft are attractive for remote surveillance applications in which the aircraft could remain on station for months or years. In order to increase the geographic area that the HALE aircraft can cover, it is essential that the efficiency of the solar cell be improved. The cells described in the proposal could be easily converted for use in HALE applications. Customers that could benefit from this cell technology include DARPA (Vulture aircraft), Airbus (manufacturer of the Zephyr UAV), and Facebook or Google (new players in the HALE market)."

The low-profile design, combined with world record performance, will yield W\/m3 metrics that are unprecedented for space photovoltaics. Use of concentrating optics enables dramatic (order of magnitude) cost savings through reduction in III-V material usage, while also improving radiation shielding. Rigidity is provided by the lens array combined with a lightweight honeycomb composite. Key innovations include: (1) low profile optics using monolithic, ultra-thin, lightweight lens arrays; (2) microscale 6 junction solar cells with 40% efficiency (AM0) at 1sun and high concentration efficiency of &gt;46%, which are stacked by (3) micro-transfer printing directly onto (4) COTS c-Si cells. The use of larger area c-Si allows the design to generate power without solar tracking. This capability is important during deployment and mitigates the risks associated with a loss of tracking accuracy.BENEFIT:The research and development will produce light-weight solar arrays with significantly higher specific power densities (W\/m3, W\/m2, W\/kg) and lower costs than what is available at present or is anticipated to be available in the foreseeable future. Concentrator configurations increase the radiation hardness of the solar arrays of the research and development. The outcome of the proposed work is expected to be applicable for solar power generation in commercial spacecraft."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Autonomous operations in space, particularly with respect to health and resilience, are becoming increasingly important features of satellite platforms. Systems that respond to threat indicators from sensor fusion and external sources have to generate and evaluate potentially large sets of COAs based on incomplete or noisy data. Such systems need to reason under uncertainty and anticipate possible contingencies for plans that involve complex sequencing and sensor tasking. The Probabilistic Reasoning for Enhanced Course of Action Generation (PRECOG) system uses advanced probabilistic reasoning methods to represent complex COAs and their evolution under uncertainty and to optimize the choice of COAs against multiple objectives. The representation of COAs includes the ability to task sensors and allows execution of actions to depend on the occurrence of contingent events or the results of sensor fusion. PRECOG will advance the state of the art in decision making algorithms, enabling efficient COA selection on board a satellite.BENEFIT:Satellite autonomy, which enables satellites to take action in response to threats without having to wait for ground control, is a growing field. PRECOG will support satellite autonomy by efficiently selecting an optimal COA in response to a situation, while reasoning about and anticipating uncertainties and contingencies. In addition, PRECOG is highly relevant to unmanned autonomous vehicles in general, all of which could benefit from the capability to rapidly respond to situations without needing human control."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC), in partnership with ANALYTICAL GRAPHICS, Inc. (AGI), proposes to build a novel course of action (COA) development algorithm that allows information-starved space platforms to fulfill their missions when forced to act autonomously. Our effort is entitled Autonomous Robust Courses of Action under Non-quantifiable Uncertainty Models (ARCANUM). Our model is based upon a mathematical notion of robustness that explicitly represents both quantifiable and non-quantifiable uncertainties, thus accounting for sensor data ambiguities and Black Swan events that could not be anticipated or modeled in advance. We will build this approach to be viable within the limited computational resources available onboard a space vehicle, allowing it to reason independently under severe communications restrictions caused by radio frequency interference or adversary electronic\/cyber-attacks.BENEFIT:It is no longer viable to design systems that treat space as a sanctuary outside of the confines of the battlespace. To ensure viability in the increasingly non-benign space environment, early threat detection and characterization are crucial so that space vehicles can execute COAs that mitigate these threats. They must choose these actions judiciously, however, balancing mission requirements against resource limitations. If ambiguous sensor readings lead the space vehicle to execute unnecessary maneuvers, it will pre-maturely deplete its fuel supply, compromising its long-term station-keeping capability and shortening its service life. The capability developed under this effort will support the US Air Force (USAF) and the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in ensuring critical global space missions including Missile Warning, Satellite Communications, and Precision Navigation and Timing."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The objective of this proposed Phase I SBIR is to develop Space Situational Awareness (SSA) algorithms for maximizing detection probability and state estimation accuracy of Earth orbiting space objects, including active as well as inactive satellites, and breakups and debris, using a constellation of space-based multi-sensor platforms. Systems &amp; Technology Research (STR) proposes to provide a closed-loop solution that consists of both optimal estimation and optimal control. Since the estimation problem is to estimate an unknown number of object states, the problem becomes a dynamical state estimation of a random set, which we solve using a novel jump Markov, feature-aided multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm. We will use the jump Markov model for detecting and adjusting for satellite maneuvers, while the feature-aided MHT exploits multi-modal, multiple sensors on the space-based platforms. This MHT algorithm provides an optimal solution for detecting, tracking, identifying, and characterizing space objects, given a sensor schedule. Then an information-metric-driven sensor resource management (SRM) algorithm will evaluate the MHT database output and solve the optimal SRM sensor schedule problem dynamically, to ensure close-loop optimality. The Phase I goal is a technical concept demonstration, and its focus will be the GEO belt monitoring.BENEFIT:Using space-based SSA platforms will enable almost continuous SSA operations, removing space and temporal gaps of space object observations by conventional ground-based Space Surveillance Network (SSN) sensors. The potential commercial applications include space monitoring applications, especially the monitoring of the commercial geostationary satellite operations, mainly broadcasting and communication applications. In the future, commercial SSA monitoring will become necessary for other private-sector space activities, including space exploration and sightseeing."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:As space continues to become more congested and contested, our ability to identify and mitigate man-made and natural threats to space assets becomes increasingly difficult. The detectable population of resident space objects (RSOs) is not comprehensively quantified. Detection, tracking, and classification of objects such as cubesats, nanosatellites, and space debris that threaten military and commercial satellites is particularly challenging for geosynchronous earth orbits (GEO) and near-GEO regimes. To address the challenge of characterizing the population of artificial space objects, ExoAnalytic Solutions proposes to develop DENSE. ExoAnalytic will develop an information-driven method for designing space-based EO\/IR sensors and multi-sensor architectures that will provide maximum detectability and state assessment of GEO and near-GEO space objects. Sensor design will focus on parameters of optical sensors affecting minimum detectable target (ex. aperture, quantum efficiency, detection algorithms) and data collection for feature estimation (ex. size, shape, surface material properties). Architecture design will focus on critical system performance figures of merit including maximizing detections within a specified period of time.BENEFIT:The development of DENSE will be significant for SSA because it will: - Allow for a better understanding of the space debris environment in the 1-10 cm size regime - Quantitatively compare the performance of various space-based sensor design alternatives on key figures of merit including (minimum detectable target, FOV, etc.) - Quantitatively compare the performance of various space-based sensor architecture and CONOPs alternatives on key figures of merit including (maximizing target detections, catalog maintenance accuracy, space object classification accuracy) - Compile and identify the priority set of signature feature observables based on sensor spectral band, irradiation conditions, and object altitude, size, geometrical\/thermal complexity, and dynamic motion - Develop algorithms SSA architectures that address some specialized sensing and identification issues that include space operator\/analyst performance response time (based on single or multiple orbital pass observations) and discriminating solar glint from thruster engine burns"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The objective of this solicitation is to develop real-time automatic scaling software for oblique ionograms (OIs). The NWRA team has developed an extensive HF propagation computational tool set, which includes a capability called APEx (Automated Point Extraction) for automatically finding vertical ionogram (VI) traces within an ionogram image. APEx does not require pre-separation of the O- and X-modes of the ionogram (although this is beneficial). We will extend Apex to OIs. We show in this proposal that APEx can already be used to select OI trace points, but we will refine APEx substantially during the proposed effort. Using recently-developed mathematical concepts of sparsity and fractional norms, we will develop a robust method for selecting the desired trace data and determining whether a given point is O or X while reducing selection of noise\/interference data. A selected OI trace could be converted to an approximately equivalent VI using the laws of virtual geometry (VG) and inverted to an electron density profile, but this is an unnecessarily inaccurate method. We will instead assimilate the OI trace data directly into NWRAs assimilative ionosphere model, GPSII (GPS Ionospheric Inversion). This approach allows for ionospheric horizontal gradients that would be lost in the VG approach.BENEFIT:An automated system for finding oblique ionogram trace points will allow for real time assimilation of potentially dense networks of ionosondes. The Australian DSTO has already fielded such a network, the Dense Integrated Network of Ionospheric Sensors (DINIS), for defining the propagation environment of their OTH radar system, JORN. A similar networked sounding system has been proposed for the US Next Generation OTH Radar (NGOTHR). Making best use of the ionograms provided by an ionospheric sounding network to improve the geolocation accuracy of NGOTHR will require a direct 3D ionospheric data assimilation algorithm like NWRAs GPS Ionospheric Inversion (GPSII). For GPSII to function without a human in the loop, as will be necessary for the throughput required of NGOTHR, automated trace extraction will be required. This capability will also benefit the intelligence community. A limitation of HF geolocation of emitters in denied territories is the inability to measure the ionosphere in the denied region using vertical ionosondes. However, it is often completely reasonable to propagate over a denied region using oblique-incidence HF paths, that is, oblique ionograms. GPSII is already being evaluated in the IARPA HFGeo program and has proven to provide unparalleled accuracy in accounting for the signal deflections caused by medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). A reliable OI autoscaling capability will extend the benefit of GPSII to HFGeo in denied territories."

The proposed Lowell Oblique-Ionogram Autoscaler, LOIA will automatically extract and identify the echo traces of ionospherically reflected radio signals in digital OI data records. LOIA will be designed to process a variety of both polarization-tagged and -untagged oblique ionograms. It will operate an intelligent system for trace extraction from OI images based on a bio-plausible model of pre-attentive vision. The intelligent vision model will use a signal detector and a long-range analyzer of potential trace elements to determine if they belong to the same trace. Thus extracted traces will be cross-matched with predicted trace shapes for identification. The predicted shapes will be computed using real-time ionospheric specifications available from the Global Ionospheric Radio Observatory (GIRO) and the IRI Real-Time Assimilative Model IRTAM available from the Lowell GIRO Data Center. Once the extracted traces are identified, LOIA will run an iterative model fit for accurate evaluation of the F layer maximum usable frequencies, MUFo and MUFx.BENEFIT:The Lowell Oblique-Ionogram Autoscaler LOIA can become a powerful tool for companies that provide diagnostics and operational support for the optimization of the operation of HF direction finding and Over-the-Horizon Radar services.

During a kickoff meeting with the sponsor of this topic, we will discuss with the client, the detailed parameter requirements for common FOV\/F#, their priorities for performance tradeoffs, and determine spectral bands extents, apparent temperature ranges (radiance), frame rate data throughput, and other performance issues that are feasible to accomplish within the SBIR Phase 1 and Future Phase 2 budget limitations.BENEFIT:The development of an Ultra High resolution SWIR-Visible Scene Projector has applications in both the military and civilian market. The SWIR spectral band is now receiving more interest for new sensor capabilities enhancing identification and discrimination capabilities. Camera and sensor manufactures, testing agencies, and organizations interested in overall system performance are all potential users for such a developed product."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Corvid Technologies and 3D Systems will collaborate to develop novel penetrator structures for enhancement of explosive and fuze survivability. These structures will provide lethality and penetration capability equal to or better than conventional penetrator designs. Our approach will optimize structural components and combine them in practical ways to meet penetrator functional goals. Topology optimization will maximize component mass specific strength, and strain energy rates at collapse being minimize. Optimization will be done at both the meso- and macro-scales. Mesoscale structures will be based lined against pyramidal lattices. The resulting metamaterials will be homogenized for implementation into computational structural dynamics simulations. These simulations will be used to optimize the macro-scale component topology by maximizing of charge-to-structure mass ratio and overall strength. 3D Systems will use additive manufacturing to create subscale prototypes of up to three penetrator designs. These prototypes will capture both the meso-scale structures and full-scale design details. Corvid will evaluate the prototypes performance using their compressed air gun to fire the prototypes into optically clear targets with oblique features and capture response with highspeed video. Phase I will result in an understanding of how topology optimization can improve penetrator structural performance. Phase II will mature these design concepts.BENEFIT:Commercialization will include expanded engineering services utilizing the approaches developed under this SBIR, and potential licensing of the modeling and visualization tools to interested third parties. These include military and civilian organizations dedicated to the development of materials and processes which improve performance metrics or fulfill the requirements of novel applications. In particular, the emergence of additive manufacturing of materials and components with adaptive properties using metal and polymers is one application where the ability to accurately predict mesostructural performance and effective behavior at a system-level would be imminently relevant."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The future of small unmanned air systems and miniature munitions is in the precise delivery of small ordinance and smaller, potentially adjustable, explosive effects. To enable this capability, a miniature Semi-active Laser (SAL) end-to-end solution is needed. Current laser designators are too large, fragile, and far too expensive and current SAL seekers are too large to be used in miniature weapons and SUAS ordinance delivery. We propose to develop a dual-band seeker solution as well as the pointers for both of these bands. The first band uses a conventional Laser Designator\/Laser Target Marker, and the second band uses and eye-safe target marker.BENEFIT:A compact dual band seeker head will allow the warfighter to use munitions with better accuracy. The seeker head can also be used as a spotter in other applications where laser spot tracking is necessary. In addition, the new miniature markers developed under this contract would allow more warfighters to use them because they are eye-safe."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Karagozian and Case, Inc. (K&amp;C) proposes to develop a Rigid-Body Off-Axis Ordnance Shock And Tail-Slap Environment Replicator (ROOSTER) concept which can induce peak accelerations over 10,000 g for sustained periods of at least 5 ms to sub-scale non-inventory warheads in order to replicate the harsh and complex deceleration environment experienced by ordnance during penetration. The concept takes advantage of the known strengths of at least two different types of dynamic loaders to accelerate a pseudo-static test penetrator, and a proven approach to subsequently arrest it. The concept consists of three key elements, each targeting an essential component of the required acceleration response. The first is an impact-driven loader that acts to generate the desired peak accelerations over a very short time-frame. The second element, adds a second dynamic loader that acts on the test penetrator over a much longer duration. The loaders used for this element leverages strain-energy or fast-acting hydraulically-driven loaders, which are far more effective during this time-frame. The final essential component consists of an arrestment basin, which acts to catch and decelerate the test article, since the test apparatus will send it traveling at significant velocities.BENEFIT:The proposed test fixture closely mimic the penetration phenomenology providing realistic axial accelerations on the penetrator body and can also induce realistic lateral accelerations by a simple modification of the test setup. This test fixture will enable the Air Force to adequately test the next generation of fuzing technologies which are needed to meet increasingly challenging requirements, for enhanced penetration capabilities. Furthermore, the ability to model high-velocity impact scenarios will provide opportunities to test and enhance the protection of storage for hazardous\/nuclear waste, especially during transit."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The objective of this project is to develop ordnance shock\/tail-slap environment replicator machines that can applying high acceleration\/deceleration pulses of over 10,000 g peak over long durations of over 5 msec. The proposal describes two novel classes of shock\/tail-slap testing machine concepts for feasibility study. The first novel class of multi-axial shock\/tail-slap replicator machines can apply acceleration\/deceleration pulses with over 10,000 g peak and around 0.1 msec duration over periods of well over 5 msec. The machines can apply multi-axial shock loading pulses to the ordnance in the axial and lateral directions to simulate almost any shock loading event, including the tail-slap shocks, where large lateral accelerations are introduced due to the bending and rebound of the ordnance in the lateral direction. The second novel class of shock\/tail-slap testing machine concepts can achieve high and long duration shock loading to simulate target penetration with the capability of simultaneously applying relatively short duration lateral shock loading to replicate tail-slap shock loading events caused by lateral accelerations that are introduced due to the bending and rebound of the ordnance in the lateral direction. Both concepts provide multi-axial shock testing machines for low-cost, highly repeatable and reusable testing of ordnance.BENEFIT:Although the present shock testing machines are to be developed for specific needs of testing ordnance of various types under various launch and target interaction environments, a technology that can reliably replicate various shock loading events and is highly repeatable, has numerous commercial applications, particularly when tests are at a relatively inexpensive cost. For example, such shock testing machines, designed for testing the effects of acceleration\/deceleration events experienced by packaged electronics, instrumentations and various components used in aerospace and various vehicles and appliances that are prone to be dropped and the like will have a wide range of commercial applications. Such machines are particularly useful for product designers since the product to be tested can be readily instrumented and its response and behavior videoed for analysis of determination of performance as well as possible modes of failure."

Heavy rainfall, ground clutter, and modern electronic countermeasures such as low observability stealth technology all present unique challenges for target detection and discrimination. We propose the development of an advanced multi-polarization antenna targeting Ka band frequencies. Our approach merges together two enabling technologies that have been developed by Nuvotronics into a new type of seeker architecture. Dual polarized radiating elements and their associated feed networkincluding a monopulse comparator networkwill be fabricated in Nuvotronics unique PolyStrata process to enable state of the art antenna gain and efficiency, utilizing air-dielectric micro-coax. Antenna designs will be validated by prototype hardware fabricated during Phase I.BENEFIT:The proposed technology has application to numerous weapon platforms at numerous frequency bands. Our Phase I technical approach is specifically tailored for inclusion in a multi-mode seeker (mmW, infrared and semi-active laser guidance) for next-generation self-guided munitions such as an improved Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB-II) or Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM). Identifying additional product insertion points will be a topic of our Phase I and Phase II research. Beyond weapon platforms, there are numerous other military and commercial applications for the active radar technologies to be developed on this program. Microwave and millimeter-wave radar systems have applicability to landing in degraded visual environment (e.g. brown-out conditions) which is a significant problem for all rotorcraft operating in the desert environments. DVE radars also have spaceborne applicability, for example, the Mars Planetary landing radars such as what is used for the Mars Science Laboratory mission. In addition to radar applications, millimeter-wave communications is receiving increasing attention. The hardware designs for the proposed program can be leveraged for this market space."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The overall goal for this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a methodology to develop advanced cumulative-damage models that predict time-dependent reinforced concrete (RC)-bunker wall deflection, spalling, breach, secondary debris generation, and the incremental wall damage state from multiple weapon detonations. This effort builds on previous work conducted by K&amp;C and ACTA in (1) analytically modeling the behaviors of walls to multiple hits and (2) developing a High Fidelity Physics Based (HFPB) fast-running model (FRM) for modeling cumulative damage resulting from multi-hits scenarios. In this proposal an advanced cumulative damage FRM (ACD-FRM), incorporating the complicated physics involved in multiple loadings leading to local and global failure of RC components will be developed. The methodology proposed to develop the ACD-FRM is general in nature and can be readily extended to other structural components or systems and for loadings other than blast and fragmentation. The broad methodology developed under this effort will provide a rational approach for the stochastic consideration of accumulated or cyclic damage and has broad applicability across a range of industries where consideration of accumulated damage and the associated requirements for repair, maintenance and replacement is critical, such as the energy, utility and transportation industries.BENEFIT:As a science and engineering consulting company actively involved in a multitude of government and private industries including building construction, defense, anti-terrorism, petrochemical plant safety, and nuclear plant and infrastructure safety, K&amp;C is in an excellent position to market, commercialize, and transition the technologies developed under this project. These clients, especially related to their overseas operations, have particular concerns related to the risks engendered by blast and fragmentation loading as well as cumulative damage effects. The U.S. defense community is another clear market for this technology, which also has interest in the resilience of structures and having the ability to evaluate the effects of cumulative damage. In this regard, the stochastic approach to be taken to modeling cumulative damage will be especially of interest since the probability of a particular outcome in a cumulative damage targeting problem should reflect the uncertainties involved if it is to be useful."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This proposal describes an approach to meeting AFRLs goals of upgrading MEVA to accurately assess the cumulative damage effects of Multi-Hit targeting scenarios. The approach makes use of WAIs coupled NLFlex\/VCFD software for the HFPB computational component of this effort and leverages WAIs wide ranging experience in using HFPB modeling to simulate the response of the full range of structural construction types to threats of interest. It also relies on WAIs experience in developing innovative FRM tools for evaluating blast effects of concrete components including breach and secondary debris and familiarity with the MEVA software.BENEFIT:The primary benefit of this R&amp;D will be the extension of MEVA to address multi-strike attacks on high strength RC bunkers. The primary market for the cumulative damage blast response modules developed under this project would be DOD organizations in the U.S. For example, DTRA develops and maintains the IMEA software for offensive targeting needs and VAPO for terrorist threats to civil construction. The new modules have potential application to both VAPO and IMEA. A previous example of this type of commercialization synergy was the Multi-hit Progressive Collapse (MPC) FRM developed by WAI under AFRL funding for inclusion within the MEVA software. At a later date, WAI received funding from DTRA to extend the steel connection modeling capabilities of MPC. Once this extension was completed, DTRA funded WAI to incorporate MPC within DTRAs VAPO software. And more recently, the Department of Homeland Security funded WAI to incorporate MPC capability within its UrbanBlast software. UrbanBlast is a FRM tool developed under funding from DHS for quantifying blast pressure fields and structural damage (including collapse) resulting from vehicle borne threats in urban settings."

Tactical and surveillance adaptations would be the largest potential near-term markets. We believe that our approach could be readily and cost effectively adapted to fielding of compact laser radars, coded covert (free-space-optics) line-of-sight communications and covert laser designators and serve as high-accuracy optical trackers for engaging tactical (rockets, mortars and artillery-RAM) targets; RAMs are currently major threats to the US and its allies in the context of theater and urban warfare."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Tau Technologies proposes to develop a compact, long-range active Laser Radar (LADAR) sensor that can be integrated with an existing sensor\/targeting pod. This system will be capable of detecting, tracking, and identifying a ballistic missile at ranges much greater than 100km. We propose to use a high power CW fiber laser with a high bandwidth chirp to illuminate the target. The laser will be emitted from a compact aperture compatible with a pod. The scattered laser return will be detected using a heterodyne method and processed to obtain a high range resolution target signature. This system will employ both passive and active tracking. We will use a novel approach to maximize the power coupled into the receive fiber amplifier. Using innovative signal processing methods this system will have a range resolution on the order of centimeters BENEFIT:This technology will enable the detection, tracking and identification of ballistic missiles at long range. This allows earlier target engagement and destruction, thus preventing the impact of the missile where it could cause damage or loss of life. This system will be more cost effective than current detection systems such as the Patriot. Targeting pods are easily carried on tactical aircraft and can be mounted to larger remotely piloted vehicles, allowing the deployment of this sensor into combat theaters."

These algorithms will support engagement prioritization and optimize intercept probability for an airborne weapon layer of missile defense. Corvid proposes a multi-mode sensor suite of RF and IR sensors on the host airborne platform for an accurate airborne defense capability. Corvids innovation for this topic is the use of high fidelity radar sensor modeling capabilities to develop and test radar algorithms for various components of an airborne missile defense layer. The use of synthetic radar data will allow us to build a robust airborne weapon system against a variety of scenarios and ballistic missile threat classes. In Phase I we will demonstrate the ability to detect, track, and classify the threat, and lay the framework for a full sensor architecture for further refinement in Phase II.BENEFIT:This effort will produce a capability to supply algorithms within an HWIL environment for the Air Force and MDA. Potential customers include primes (Raytheon, LM) and the proposed work is synergetic with work being done at FFRDC laboratories (MIT\/LL, JHU\/APL) Methodologies developed under this effort have the potential to support the improvement of other sensor networks across MDA including satellites and flare tracking."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In this effort, we will develop the foundations for a Theater Ballistic Missile Defense framework based on sensors and weapons placed on forward based airborne platforms. In the contested battlespace of the future, there may be near-simultaneous missile launches and artillery fire all which may cue missile defense systems. Utilizing forward based airborne platforms will allow rapid detection and tracking of these threats with the potential to engage interceptors in the launch or boost phase. We propose an integrated solution which is based on the composition of an advanced inference framework and an advanced manifold learning based characterization algorithm. Our inference framework is capable of not only performing non-linear, non-Gaussian filtering, but also simultaneously performing tracking and discrimination through kinematic data. Our characterization algorithm operates on complex data in a sensor-agnostic fashion and can easily be extended to perform multi-sensor fusion even across wavelength regimes. Through extensive knowledge of missile defense and air platform systems we intend to deliver recommendations for future sensor capabilities and CONOPS in air-based defense of Theater Ballistic Missile threats.BENEFIT:Through the development of the system proposed here, we will demonstrate a method to track and classify missile launches from an airborne platform. In a contested battlespace of the future, U.S. forward operating bases and other assets, such as aircraft carriers, may be threatened by Theater Ballistic Missiles. Currently, there are not enough anti-missile systems to counter this Theater Ballistic Missile Threat. If these bases and other assets are threatened by missiles, the U.S. Air Force may not be able to obtain complete air-superiority over enemy space. The system developed here will lead to the development of an air-based missile defense layer where forward operating aircraft can detect, characterize, and engage ballistic missile threats. This will allow the forward projection of U.S. Military forces and protect warfighters, U.S. assets, and interests."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The High Definition Munitions Warning Sensor (HDMWS) is the centerpiece for a potentially revolutionary technical breakthrough required in the reliable detection of Hostile Munitions. Our strategy is to address the limitations that exist in current HFI and MWS sensors, namely reliance on the initial muzzle flash for detection. Cyan has developed one of the first HD 1920 x 1080 infrared readout integrated circuits with increased spatial resolution. These HD sensors offer unprecedented new capabilities to address longer standoff range hostile fire detection and sight ID. Small pixels with fast framing provide dramatic improvements in signal to noise ratio (SNR) allowing the detection of low observables. A summary of long term systems benefits for HDTWS include: (1) Advanced motion detection, transient detection sensors for locating moving objects, e.g. on FPA moving target processing allows improved capabilities to create geolocation maps and recognize targets and individuals. Small pixels enable new capabilities for detecting augmented weapons sites. (2) Reduced false alarm oversampling, e.g. oversampling demonstrates dramatic reductions in false alarms at lower SNR levels. (3) Enhanced sensitivity resolution capability, e.g. small pixel oversampled technologies that allow increased standoff distances improved resolution and much smaller SWAP than existing sensors. BENEFIT:Novel high performance low cost High Definition FPAs\/detectors 2. Dramatic NEI performance which extends range of Muzzle\/Munition launch flash and thermal munition tracking beyond the current larger pixels. 3. High Performance low SWaP package on the order of 2 -3 inches in cube, similar in size to visible cameras due to small pixel pitch scaling into smaller package and optics. 4. Ability to perform stand off facial recognition with 20 size focal length lenses at 2-3 km. 5. Ability to perform off axis weapons detection, due to the ability to sense the dim angular fall off associated with off axis OA detection. 6. Dramatically improved sensivity and low false positives due to oversampling\/correlation not typically available using non-oversampled larger pixel sensors. 7. Novel ability to detect muzzle flash\/lauch flash and track munitions that have dim signatures. AF151-173 High Definition Munitions Warning Sensor(HDMWS) Cyan Systems Proposal # 21 Cyan Systems Proprietary 2.75 8. Homeland security capabilities in securing urban areas against attachs with ealier warning. 9. New potentially higher performance HFI Missile Warning Sensors with imaging and non-imaging modes simultaneously allowing fast ID and Hostile Fire event overlay. 10. High operation temperature broadband InAsSb detectors, lower cost than InSb and HgCdTe, operates at non Cryo temperatures - goals are for TE cooling."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Accurate and low cost hostile fire detection solutions are needed to effectively protect aircraft against small arms, RPGs, mortars, anti-aircraft artillery, and surface to air missiles. Detecting and classifying these types of threats is complicated by many factors including the need for full 360 coverage, requirement for high probability of detection with low false alarms, as well as variances in real world signatures. There is also the problem of having to process an enormous amount of data to cover the required spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution needed to produce a confident threat nomination. This effort is focused on developing an Uncooled Multi-Spectral sensor system specifically designed to be a low cost, compact, wide field of view, multi-spectral sensor for airborne hostile fire detection and discrimination. This practical approach will focus on implementing a novel optical design along with relatively cost effective uncooled infrared imaging sensor technologies to efficiently ascertain the critical spatial, spectral, and temporal information needed to detect and discriminate muzzle flash and plume signatures at a significantly high confidence level.BENEFIT:This novel imaging approach will have a significant impact on other related future uncooled applications. This sensor detection system design can be assimilated to other platforms such as ground combat vehicles, man portable sights, unattended sensors, etc. Furthermore the technology could incorporate alternative or even additional spectral band capabilities including providing context imagery. This design concept could also translate to other non DoD uses requiring specific discreet event detections such as security and manufacturing applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Current analytical tools are incapable of providing comprehensive effectiveness and affordability insights that inform the decision space from both the warfighters and acquirers perspectives. This research initially focuses on developing a utility value objective function cast in the context of a joint, campaign-level warfight that can be incorporated into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) to automatically generate optimized ATOs that 1) meet the warfighters target and time-based operational objectives; and 2) capture the resource allocation and cost-effectiveness view of acquirers and force providers. The research will assess and characterize the optimization formulation in terms of its ability to reach a feasible solution with minimal impact on STORMs overall performance. The methodology will produce an actionable, high-level software design and specification for Phase II implementation, leading to an analytically useful STORM capability with an integrated, optimized strike planner. The approach promises a capability within a single tool to credibly assess and quantify the comparative cost- and operational effectiveness of advanced technology and weapon concepts to inform AFRL\/RWs R&amp;D priorities and investment decisions. Further applications would involve comparative analysis of campaign outcomes to inform the broader AF acquisition strategy in its consideration of trades between platforms and weapons.BENEFIT:Phase II will produce a functional tool to capture operational effectiveness and cost\/benefit relationships within a single analysis. This will support AFRLs needs and benefit other analytically chartered organizations doing course of action operational planning, system acquisition and force structure decisions, including Analyses of Alternatives (AoAs). The tool will provide USAF\/USN\/USMC\/USA senior decision-makers with informed insights to evaluate alternative capability and weapon investment strategies. Current STORM users across DoD will benefit from this capability as it allows them to explicitly trade lethality and survivability during STORMs air interdiction planning process, thus significantly reducing the effort required to create an effective, survivable interdiction plan. Optimization in STORM that explicitly considers cost (including asset operational use and fuel cost) in the context of operational effectiveness will enhance the ability of USAF and other Services to understand and assess energy and other sustainability issues."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Metron, Incorporated proposes to leverage the strike planning optimization methodology it previously developed for the USAF, its intimate knowledge of STORM, and its unrivaled expertise in developing innovative Department of Defense (DoD) M&amp;S solutions to implement an optimal and efficient multi-criteria utility value function for assigning air packages to targets within STORM. This capability will empower STORM analysts to perform integrated cost-effectiveness modeling. Metron possesses existing, proven algorithms developed under the USAFs Fast Master Air Attack Plan (MAAP) initiative to optimize the allocation of strike resources against targets by simultaneously minimizing expected cost, maximizing expected effectiveness, and satisfying user-imposed constraints. We also have extensive experience employing STORM and the deep understanding of its architecture required to modify the model efficiently and securely. Our innovative approach involves externalizing the strike planning process in STORM to simplify development, maximize software reuse, and facilitate commercialization.BENEFIT:Current U.S. Air Force (USAF) and Joint modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) analyses follow an inefficient process wherein cost and effectiveness are modeled independently and require imperfect, manual integration of results. Incorporating a concept of cost along with algorithms designed to minimize it into warfare models would provide a significantly improved capability to assess the fiscal feasibility and sustainability of plans, CONOPS, and acquisition strategies in diverse and rapidly-evolving scenarios. This capability would improve the effectiveness and impact of USAF and Joint studies and reduce the expense associated with conducting and integrating separate cost and warfare analyses."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Currently, the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) utilizes a strike planning methodology that provides sub-optimal, and often wasteful, munitions assignments greatly reducing the utility of this vital tool. Numerica Corporation proposes to develop a novel strike planning algorithm for integration into STORM that provides guarantees on mission objectives while simultaneously minimizing fuel expenditure as well as unnecessary losses of munitions and aircraft. Numerica&apos;s solution will utilize multi-objective optimization to directly address the balance that must be struck between high value strike planning assignments and the incurred cost of those assignments. Our approach fully and completely represents the options available during difficult scenarios, rather then pretending one perfect solutions exists. Numericas solution also allows for uncertain future events to be considered in the current optimization. This results in solutions that are optimal across time, rather than suboptimal greedy solutions. Leveraging recent results in sampling theory allows our solutions to be scalable and tractable even for the large problem sizes posed by difficult engagement scenarios. The Phase I effort will include a proof-of-concept prototype, compared alongside the existing greedy solution as well as a report on the integration path for the prototype into STORM&apos;s command and control manager.BENEFIT:The main product of this Phase I effort will be a novel strike planning algorithm for integration into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM). In contrast to the current solution, this algorithm will simultaneously consider the value of the strike planning assignments as well as the incurred cost of those assignments. Additionally, this solution will consider uncertain future events resulting in a solution that is optimal across time. This will provide a considerable improvement in the quality of strike plans when compared to the greedy solution currently used in STORM. A supplemental benefit of this technology is the ability to leverage Numerica&apos;s existing uncertainty quantification tools to learn performance bounds for the output of STORM simulations when the optimal trade off between rewards and costs are not known a priori. The primary transition path for the technology in this proposal is into the command and control manager within STORM. However this solution is not specific to the STORM simulation and so could be applied to any offline planning algorithm."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Next generation semi active laser (SAL) seeker systems will be called upon to operate in more challenging environments with more challenging targets. Weapons will need the flexibility to operate in varied environments that include rural, urban, and barren solar loaded terrain. A single weapon will have configurable explosive yields to minimize collateral damage while ensuring first pass success. To enable these new weapons, a more advanced and flexible SAL system is needed. The system should enable precise aimpoint selection against stationary and moving targets, it should be compatible with fielded 1064 nm solid state laser designators, and with future generation eye safe wavelength, diode laser based, 1550 nm coded waveform designators. It should be able to guide weapons that are dropped from miles away or work with rocket propelled grenades that are fired from just 500 meters away. We propose to develop a specialized low cost seeker sensor that has both a wide field of view, positional accuracy, and the ability to lock onto codes. BENEFIT:At the end of a successful program, Attollo will deliver a prototype a Dual-Band and Dual-Mode SAL seeker solution that will spot, discriminate, track, and provide full aiming guidance information to laser guided munitions. The wide field of view, array solution will provide substantially more information than todays seekers, and it will be compatible with both todays 1064 nm laser designator, but also next generation eye-safe (15xx nm) high bandwidth laser designators. This capability will ease the transition from high-power Class IV laser designation to lower power eye-safe laser designation, while maintaining backward compatibility. These systems will enable a changeover in seeker technology over time. New munitions can be outfitted with our seeker solution and they can be guided with either the eye-safe designator or standard 1064 nm laser designators. In addition, the seeker enables a new category of short range (&lt; 3 km) small caliber munitions which require a higher bandwidth designator for course corrections. Our 10kHz eye-safe designator provides timely feedback for the munition. With these advancements, the warfighter can maximize lethality while minimizing collateral damage. In addition, by moving to eye-safe designators, combination rangefinder\/designators will decrease in cost enabling their wider deployment."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Active millimeter wave seekers are needed at a lower cost point in order to improve load-out for future air-ground missions. Our approach to developing a $15,000 RF seeker is to create a passive electronically-steerable antenna that is driven by COTS amplifiers and protected by COTS limiters and is built from low cost packaging techniques. Our PESA will use low-loss switch devices in a new way that minimizes RF loss while providing affordable mass production. A near-hermetic coating system will protect chip-and-wire electronics while providing electromagnetic shielding. Phase I will develop performance and cost predictions for our approach.BENEFIT:The proposed technology has application to a variety of weapons platforms at numerous frequency bands. Our Phase I technical approach is specifically tailored for inclusion in a either an X-band, Ku-band or Ka-band seeker for next-generation self-guided munitions such as an improved Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB-II) or Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM). Identifying additional product insertion points will be a topic of our Phase I and Phase II research. Beyond weapons platforms, there are several other military and commercial applications for the RF seeker technologies to be developed on this program. Radar sensors as well as radios are in need of affordable solutions to electronic beam-steering."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Karagozian and Case, Inc. (K&amp;C) proposes to develop experimental methods and material models that can be used to safely and accurately extract the required fundamental properties of as-received composite SRM materials needed to understand their dynamic fragmentation characteristics. K&amp;Cs proposed approach consists of: (1) designing a suite of experiments and measurements, using dynamic recovery methods, that can be used to dynamically fracture SRM cases under controllable loads and rates of deformation and measure their fragmentation properties; (2) developing analytic or numerical models or algorithms that can be used to correlate these fragmentation characteristics to fundamental material properties that can be obtained through non-destructive testing; (3) performing a set of limited proof-of-concept tests on a suitable material sample to demonstrate feasibility of our approach; and (4) augmenting our existing material and fragmentation models for quasi-brittle materials to accept the measured material properties and demonstrating their use in Computational Solid Dynamics (CSD) calculations of fractured composite SRM casings.BENEFIT:The proposed test and modeling methodology for material characterization and non-destructive testing are likely to find several non-military applications. The potential to combine the developed understanding of material fracture processes and the ability to predict them utilizing simple measurements from non-destructive techniques, including acoustic or laser sensors, would present a unique tool to assess the in-situ condition of various materials. For example, the inspection and condition monitoring of energy distribution networks and utility pipelines is a potentially large market, both in the US and overseas."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:ENIG, in collaboration with SRI International (Menlo Park, CA), proposes to develop a modeling methodology with predictive and inferential capabilities to address the mechanical limits of structural reactive materials (SRMs) using subcritical mechanical material responses, (i.e. pre-reacted state). ENIGs toolkit, in conjunction with material fragmentation tests, will provide an end-to-end modeling capability, grounded in the microstructural response of the constituent materials, to address impulsive loading of reactive structural material systems. This effort will develop models and design tests that will provide both fundamental and fragmentation data for SRMs. Models and tests developed for this effort will allow the Air Force to use results obtained from nondestructive testing techniques to predict fragmentation size and shape distribution from impulsively loaded SRMs. Physics-based computational models capable of computing the size, shape, and velocity distributions of SRM fragments will treat fragmentation as a process of the interaction initiation, growth, and coalescence of cracks using a system of multi-scale hydrocode calculations. ENIG will draw upon our extensive experience in characterizing ballistic damage in ceramics, polymers, composites, metals, and combinations of these material classes. This effort will design procedures and experiments that can be conducted at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Eglin AFB.BENEFIT:The goal of this project is to develop experimental methods and measurements for safely and accurately extracting fundamental materials, properties from as manufactured Structural Reactive Material components using nondestructive evaluation techniques. The modeling tools and methodologies developed from this program may be applied to a wide variety of materials including, glass fiber composite systems, novel structural composites, multi-phased metallic structures, and complex ceramic systems. The potential impact on civilian and military applications is unlimited. Impacted industries would potentially include: advanced munitions, aviation, and automotive. The technologies developed here could be integrated with existing software to address design issues."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To implement more efficient inspection techniques for turbine engine components, such as vibrothermography, it is necessary to conduct reliability assessments. This requires a set of specimens with standardized crack defects. Traditional flexural fatigue methods for producing artificial cracks are slow, expensive and, due to lack of process reliability, very wasteful costly test pieces. These methods are also limited in where defects can be placed and the part geometries to which they can be applied. This project will use advanced laser micromachining techniques to create crack-like defects in turbine engine materials that closely mimic natural cracks when viewed by vibrothermography. The laser method will allow accurate placement of defects on almost any geometry, to well controlled depth with near zero part scrap. The time and cost for defect creation will be reduced by approximately one order of magnitude. This capability will reduce the cost of NDE reliability assessment as well as provide affordable test standards to train NDE inspectors and develop new NDE methodologies and protocols.BENEFIT:The standardized defect technology developed under this SBIR will support inspection work at the Air Logistics Complexes thereby improving affordability and availability of fielded and future aerospace weapon systems by extending their service life, ensuring flight safety, reducing sustainment costs, and affirming mission readiness. Similar benefits can accrue to the commercial aviation sector."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The main objective of the proposed work is to develop and implement a Multiscale-Multiphysics analysis tool for design, development and analysis CMC components. The multiscale-multiphysics analysis methodology will effectively capture the complex multi-axial stress states in SiC-SiC based CMC sub-elements and components under relevant operating conditions. The unique features of the Multiscale-Multiphysics analysis tool are as enumerated below:  Ability to model inherent heterogeneities including manufacturing defects that exist at the microscale and upscale their effect on the response at the structural scale  Micromechanics models at the fine scale of interest to characterize damage and failure in the CMC constituent phases  Coupled multiphysics based models to determine the environmental degradation of mechanical properties due to oxygen embrittlement at elevated temperatures  A temporal-multiscale approach based fatigue life prediction model  Material calibration module to characterize properties of the fine scale constituents  Model reduction techniques for robustness and computation efficiency The deliverable will be in the form of a plugin for Abaqus or any other commercial finite element (FE) package used by OEMs. The software tool is envisaged to facilitate OEMs in testing of new designs and offer tremendous savings in cost and time during the development process prior to full scale component testing. BENEFIT:The current thrust areas for technology development in CMCs include small component fabrication, ceramic joining and integration, material and component testing and characterization and design and analysis of concept components. As these manufacturing technologies mature, more and more of the metal-alloy based hot section components will be replaced by components made from CMCs. And as the applications of CMCs grow, the market for failure and fatigue life prediction technologies is also expected to grow significantly. The proposed comprehensive analysis tool will not only allow for strength and life prediction of CMC sub-elements and components, but also create a general framework for future development. The features of the spatial-multiscale approach allows microstructural details including imperfections to be taken into account. The multiphysics aspect incorporates constitutive relations to model coupled physical phenomena occurring at the microstructural length scale. The temporal multiscale feature allows the physical phenomena of cyclic loading and the resulting damage progression to be resolved under disparate time scales. These fundamental features of the proposed approach are essential in the softwares ability to reliably and accuracy predict the response of CMC components. The tool will assist OEMs in characterizing CMC material properties based on coupon testing and then use these validated models in component testing. The tool is also envisaged to promote design, development and testing of concept components and offer tremendous savings in cost and time. The technology developed under this SBIR project, has the potential to generate numerous opportunities for commercialization. Through direct cooperation with prospective OEMs and AFRL, we will initiate the commercialization process through technology insertion into this initial group of highly-motivated end-users. In addition, implementation of the tool as an Abaqus plugin provides access to a Simulias customer base which includes a number of aerospace, mechanical, civil, offshore, shipbuilding and transportation industries. Our strategic partnership with Simulia increases the opportunity of commercialization of the technology proposed here."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Innovative research and development leading to a dual-use advanced technology product is proposed. The product is a methodology and associated software for CMC component analysis under aircraft engine hot-section service loading and environmental conditions using coupon test data as input to models. SAI proposes to further develop and validate a mechanistic damage-based non-linear deformation model that SAI has been developing under prior Air Force programs to make it suitable for CMC component analyses under service loading and environment conditions and non-uniform fiber structures. Once developed and validated, the methodology would be used in cost effective development of CMC components by the Air Force and its major suppliers. The proposed methodology would be applicable to a broad class of CMCs and components for military and commercial applications. The approach includes direct consideration of relevant defect and damage mechanisms. Phase I will include characterization and modeling of existing CMC data obtained from Roll-Royce Corporation and the Boeing Company (our industry endorsers). The models will be validated against experimental data from sub-element and feature specimens relevant to CMC components. Predictions will be compared with experimental measurements to assess the modeling approach and feasibility for a comprehensive methodology development in Phase II. BENEFIT:Due to the proliferation in potential applications of ceramic matrix composites in military and commercial aerospace engines, and in industrial gas turbine and nuclear industries, the proposed dual-use high technology product has an immediate and expanding market. Potential customers would include Rolls-Royce, Pratt and Whitney, General electric Aerospace, the Boeing Company, Solar Turbines, Inc. and General Atomics. SAI will market the methodology, the software and technical expertise (services) to these and other industries."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Although a great deal of success in structural integrity management of aircraft using damage tolerance concepts has been achieved, this may be realized by excessively conservative assumptions, high inspection burdens, and aggressive maintenance and repair strategies. Even with these conservative processes, instances of early failure can occur. There is a recognized need to improve structural integrity calculations through the inclusion of the effect of existing corrosion damage on fatigue. To address this critical need, a computational model will be developed that utilizes finite element analysis and linear elastic fracture mechanics techniques to predict fatigue life of aircraft components based on measured environmental usage spectra and the subsequent corrosion damage. A severity map indicating remaining useful life across the component will be useful for indicating hotspots where crack initiation and failure is likely. The modeling tool will leverage Luna corrosion models and test and measurement systems and corrosion fatigue research ongoing at the University Virginia. This approach will provide the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) community with software for next-generation damage tolerant prediction of corrosion fatigue of high-performance aluminum alloy components to ensure the readiness and structural integrity of aircraft.BENEFIT:A successful development effort will result in a corrosion fatigue model for life prediction of high-performance aluminum alloy aircraft components. The technology will be useful for establishing the susceptibility for failure of a specific designed component and developing a corrosion prevention and control program and supporting structural maintenance based on a combination of actual usage data and life predictions from the model. The technology would have value to a wide range of DoD and civil infrastructure assets along with commercial products. The initial customer for the corrosion fatigue prediction software is the AFRL Corrosion IPT and broader Air Force corrosion and sustainment community. The most immediate market opportunities will be within the Air Force and DoD aviation corrosion research communities to predict and test aircraft materials and component performance. Besides early adopters in the aviation community, other DoD applications would include ships, ground vehicles, and support equipment. Commercial industries that would benefit from improved structural integrity management include transportation (automotive\/aerospace\/shipping) and infrastructure (coastal and offshore structures)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To address the Air Force need for a nondestructive inspection (NDI) tool for corrosion detection in sub-structures, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Substructure Corrosion Advanced NDI Tool (SCANDIT). This proposed device solution is based on a new system design that leverages POC-developed NDI technology and state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf components. Specifically, system-level innovations provide SCANDIT with versatility, portability, and usability for NDI applications. SCANDIT also includes advanced signal analysis methods that enhance the resolution, scan rate, and detection capability of SCANDIT. As a result, SCANDIT offers the capability to effectively detect and quantify corrosion as small as 0.075 in. in diameter and 0.02 in. thick through up to 0.2 in. of aluminum or up to 0.5 in. of composite, including surface coatings and treatments, which directly addresses the Air Force requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of SCANDIT by conducting measurements of test technologies with representative test specimens. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a prototype SCANDIT system for field portable applications and to demonstrate and validate it with stack-up configurations to be defined by the government.BENEFIT:Government applications of the SCANDIT technology will include NDI of structural metallic components in aircraft (Air Force, Navy), spacecraft (Air Force, NASA), and naval vessels (Navy). For example, multilayer metallic structures in aircraft fuselage can develop cracks near fasteners and bushings that can be difficult to detect using conventional means. Additional applications include NDI of structural steel components of nuclear and fossil fuel power plants and refineries. Potential customers of SCANDIT may include commercial airline manufacturers such as Boeing."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Corrosion of aluminum aircraft structures affects remaining life and safety . When corrosion occurs below the surface of exterior panels, current inspection methods require panels to be removed and replaced. An inspection method is needed that eliminates the necessity of removing exterior aircraft panels. The proposed effort will develop an inspection system capable of rapid, wide-area inspection of aluminum substructures through aluminum or composite exterior panels. It will build on JENTEKs magnetoresistive magnetometer array (MR-MWM-Array) technology and use multiple frequencies to estimate material loss, via JENTEKs HyperLattice multivariate inverse methods. The objective is to detect corrosion loss of 0.02 in. depth by 0.075 in. diameter on the buried, near surface of a 0.25 in. thick aluminum substructure through 0.2 in. thick aluminum or 0.5 in. thick IM7 5240-4 composite skins. This will be demonstrated in Phase I and extended in Phase II to address specific Air Force needs. JENTEKs latest 8200 series instruments provide significant improvements over predecessors, such as lower frequencies; simultaneous operation at multiple frequencies; high data rates; 119 parallel channels; improved signal-to-noise; and ergonomic\/software improvements, including reduced size\/weight. These technological advances will allow rapid, wide-area scanning for corrosion, cracks, and other flaws. BENEFIT:If the proposed SBIR program is successful the Air Force will have a new capability to perform a rapid, wide-area, corrosion inspection of hidden structures. The capability to account for variability in skin thicknesses and internal structure geometries and provide reliable sizing of corrosion defects is needed for a wide range of military platforms. This program will complement JENTEKs ongoing successes in other markets, such as Oil &amp; Gas for corrosion imaging and together have a broad impact on safety and costs."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In the past several years, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged from the research environment into initial applications in a wide variety of fields. Before SHM systems can be implemented in an operational environment, there is a need for new methods and procedures to compensate for uncertainty in SHM systems arising from a variety of reasons, including component geometry, loading and boundary condition changes, aging effects etc. In this program Acellent proposes to develop an innovative Multi-Physics-Based Intelligence Sensing System for Fatigue and Fastener Crack Detection in Multi-Layer structures to address the uncertainities for detection. The goal will be to accurately detect, locate and characterize fatigue cracks as well as corner cracks originating from fastener holes in multi-layer structures. Phase I will focus on defining the overall SHM framework and developing methodologies to compensate for variability in an operational environment. The methods used will be practical for real-world applications and be applicable for robust operation of the SHM system in austere flight\/field environments with limited maintenance and low false call rates. The program will be supported by Boeing for future implementation on aircraft structures in concurrence with the U.S. Air Force Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) requirements.BENEFIT:The largest and nearest-term impact areas for the technology are inaccessible areas in todays aircraft. Economic factors drive the need to keep these vehicles in-service for longer periods of time, often well beyond their designed service life. As these structures age, there is an increasing need for inspection to ensure public safety, ensure combat readiness and schedule maintenance effectively. The high cost of owning and operating these systems provides incentives for enhancing the means of evaluating and monitoring their structural integrity. The big challenge to this industry is that it must maintain a high standard of safety with its fleet in an economic environment with cost-effectiveness that is intensely competitive. With the growing number of older aircraft in service, the business case for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) retrofit applications is increasingly gaining more and more momentum. Retrofit applications focused on monitoring age-related degradation parameters like fatigue, corrosion and delamination are a key target of SHM. The target SHM technology is lightweight, easy to install and simple to use. The emphasis is not only on the development of further new SHM technologies, but also on testing the SHM systems robustness in representative environments to mature future service applications. The proposed system could potentially lead to significant savings in maintenance costs for aircraft (30-90% depending on application), can enhance the reliability of the structures and improve their efficiency, safety, and readiness. The proposed innovative, integrated inspection system, can efficiently and economically manage structural inspection data for the fleets of aging U.S. Air Force aircraft. The proposed work will be conducted in close collaboration with companies such as Boeing to ensure that this work will be directly beneficial to them."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Structural issues in aircraft such as aging, fatigue, and cracking have significant effects on the reliability, safety, and lifetime of airframes. Historically managed through nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, verification of airframe structural integrity has proven to be a costly and labor intensive process. Furthermore, NDE techniques often require removal of aircraft from service in order to perform the necessary analysis for crack detection and structural health verification. The ability to monitor for crack initiation and growth in-service throughout an aircrafts lifecycle will ensure early detection of impending faults while simultaneously supporting the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). To provide visibility into aircraft structural health, Luna proposes the development of an in-service, multi-modal sensing platform based on electrical impedance tomography and time domain reflectometry techniques to perform long-term evaluations of structural health including crack identification and quantification. The on-line, real-time measurements from an array of embedded electrodes will provide localization and quantification of structural defects while autonomously accounting for stochastic variability associated with complex aircraft structural components. The Phase I design will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of the measurement and analysis techniques, and will conclude with the development of a Phase II transition plan and a laboratory demonstration.BENEFIT:Development of the proposed system will offer aircraft maintainers a new, on-line method for evaluation of structural health without requiring significant aircraft down-time or labor intensive manual inspections. Using an array of measurement electrodes for electrical impedance tomography and time domain reflectometry, maintainers will be able to quickly identify, locate, and quantify damage within an airframe, allowing for adherence to damage tolerance concepts highlighted in the Air Forces Aircraft Structural Integrity Program. This project is a unique opportunity to combine technologies and expert knowledge in nondestructive evaluation, electronics, materials science, and structural health monitoring to establish a broadly applicable and comprehensive system for assessing in-service structural damage. Outside of the Air Force, civilian aerospace, transportation markets, infrastructure, and marine vessels can all benefit from the multi-modal impedance and reflectometry damage detection techniques."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:A major cost in maintaining low observable (LO) aircraft is the inspection and repair of the outer mold line (OML) coating system. Airmen survey the entire OML looking for defects, trace defects onto transparent sheets while noting their position relative to surface features, measure and estimate defect size and position, then enter the data into an aircraft maintenance system. IAI proposes to develop an automated inspection tool (AUTO-SCAN\/XT) to allow airmen to significantly reduce inspection times, improve inspection accuracy and reduce sources of error in the inspection process. The key innovation is a combination of optical inspection and robotic localization technologies that allows a user to characterize a defect and record its location on the aircraft with a press of a button. This information can then be rapidly uploaded to signature assessment systems. The Phase 1 effort will build on IAIs existing characterization and localization technology and demonstrate the feasibility of applying it to aircraft OML inspection using a breadboard prototype system. The Phase 2 effort will develop an advanced system prototype and demonstrate it in a relevant environment.BENEFIT:The key advantage of AUTO-SCAN\/XT is the automatic characterization and registration of surface defects in the OML of low observable aircraft. The system will decrease inspection times and minimize sources of errors. This technology will greatly benefit the Air Force by reducing maintenance costs of LO aircraft while improving aircraft availability."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Structural adhesive bonding of titanium alloys and other metals offers many advantages over mechanical fasteners, but requires careful surface preparation to avoid premature bond failure. The existing surface treatment options have significant disadvantages, including hazardous material usage, the potential for contamination from debris, and long treatment times. A media-free technology that addresses these issues could significantly alter the landscape and enable wider adoption and access to the superior properties of structural adhesive bonding. Adhesion promotion with atmospheric plasma surface treatment has emerged in recent years as a promising technology to complement, or possibly replace, current surface preparation techniques. The benefits of atmospheric plasma for cleaning, functionalizing, and otherwise preparing surfaces for enhanced bonding are well documented, and Atmospheric Plasma Solutions, Inc. (APS) has demonstrated that its unique high power, air-based PlasmaFlux technology can enhance the bonding of titanium alloys. The proposed work will begin a formal investigation into an improved process using plasma to bond titanium alloys and other materials, including optimization trials and materials testing with ASTM protocols. APS will utilize its wealth of experience with multiple forms of atmospheric plasma technology to improve surface preparation for bonding and related applications in aerospace fabrication and maintenance. BENEFIT:Existing titanium adherent preparation involves many steps to produce a high strength, consistent bond. Atmospheric plasma has the potential to eliminate multiple steps in the complicated process which will reduce the time required for repairs and reduce probability of improper surface preparation technique. Furthermore, existing surface preparation techniques rely on media (e.g. abrasives), solvents, other chemicals and coatings which often contain hazardous materials and can present environmental challenges and added compliance and disposal costs, in addition to the cost of the media and chemicals themselves. Adhesion promotion with atmospheric plasma, on the other hand, requires no media, solvents, or chemicals, generates no waste streams, and presents no undue occupational or environmental hazards to the operators. The media-free technology requires only compressed air and electricity as inputs, and may be used on virtually any surface. The immediate benefit of this development is an efficient, environmentally-friendly process that will greatly improve structural bonding of titanium alloys and other materials systems. This technology is a true dual-use technology and with further development can provide a complete solution for surface preparation for bonding and a wide variety of other applications across the military and commercial sectors. The technology will provide the benefits of reduced capital and labor costs, improved environmental compliance, and improved strength and reliability of assemblies made using the plasma-based structural bonding process."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Triton Systems Inc proposes to develop an environmentally friendly surface preparation method for titanium (Ti6Al4V) to address the US Air Forces need for a robust consistent treatment process to replace current methods such as Chromic Acid Anodization, Pasa-Jell treatment and alkaline or acid oxidation. The proposed Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology by furnishing preliminary data on bond strength durability of treated titanium to Air Force epoxy structural adhesives. During the Phase I, Triton will optimize its surface preparation method through detailed experimentation, and demonstrate cohesive joint failure in adhesively bonded lap shear joint test coupons prepared using treated Ti6Al4V. The process that will be developed will address the US Air Forces need for a simple, environmentally safe effective process that could be applied to metallic adherends in both OEM manufacturing environments as well as during field\/depot level repairs. The results will also guide the design of robotic treatment systems that will be undertaken in the Phase II and beyond. Triton sees significant benefit from this technology in the overall aerospace industry as well as automotive and medical\/biomedical industries.BENEFIT:Triton sees immediate commercial potential for its proposed technology in both military and commercial aerospace industry. The use of titanium in aircraft components and structures has been steadily increasing over the years, hence effective surface preparation methods that do not utilize hazardous chemicals, yet provide the benefits of using structural adhesives will provide significant performance benefits, both in terms of simplifying manufacture, improving bond durability and reducing overall weight. Further, the proposed surface preparation method is highly versatile and can be applied to other metallic and polymeric substrates. Hence successful demonstration of this technology will also find application in other commercial sectors such as automobile and medical\/biomedical devices where joining of dissimilar materials is routinely encountered."

Hydrogenation is a technique that has proven to be effective in electrically passivating defects in various semiconductor-based devices. Amethyst Research and Teledyne Imaging Sensors are partnering to evaluate the use of photon-assisted hydrogenation processes to passivate defects in SLS devices. The photon-assisted process has a number of unique advantages for hydrogen insertion over more conventional hydrogenation processes that can compromise the materials\/devices. The effectiveness of hydrogenation will be evaluated for its ability to increase minority carrier lifetime and to decrease dark current. The teaming of Amethyst and Teledyne provides a unique capability for evaluation of hydrogenation passivation of defects.BENEFIT:Defect passivation technology developed by the Amethyst-Teledyne team will provide a near-term, cost-effective method of improving performance that can readily be integrated into the existing process flow of FPAs and will eventually be available to all US manufacturers. Hydrogenation enhanced operability and yield gains will translate to significant reductions in cost and improved manufacturability of SLS FPAs."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:nBn detectors progressed significantly to the point that dual and triple band devices become possible, especially the ability to add Hot-MWIR to multi-color FPA. The main challenge in improving performance of nBn devices is the minority carrier lifetime which influence the reduction of dark currents, increase operation temperature, pixel operability and improve triple color nBn. Improving lifetime is a complicated task in development semiconductors. There is limited number of parameters that can be controlled through growth process (inside MBE) and after growth process which influence the lifetime. However, the real test is devices (FPAs) performance. In this project we will focus on characterization and mitigation of defects in our innovated absorber material for the nBn Hot_MW-LW by using Hydrogenation and\/or RTA followed by characterization of dark current and Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements. We successfully measured reduction of dark current for a few hydrogenated and RTA nBn devices in our lab. Our goal in Phase-I is to process 30 nBn Hot_MW-LW at different Hydrogenation and\/or RTA conditions, characterize using dark current and DLTS. We expect to improve the process of 1280X1024 12um pitch dual color and triple color FPAs by reducing the dark currents in couple orders of magnitude. BENEFIT:The current MWIR, LWIR and dual band (cool) market is mainly military applications and estimated at $3B for IDCAs annually, with the average IR camera costing more than $100,000. nBn Technologies has relations with Night Vision, NVESD (phase II for hot MWIR camera), MDA (phase-I, 2 color detector and phase-II- LWIR detector) and others. The use of this improved process for our dual and triple band cameras will increase the detector performance. New market includes Homeland security (trough wall imaging), Mine detection, Human body and trough human body imaging, atmospheric imaging and gas detection are only a few examples of new markets for the improves dual and triple bands cameras. nBn Technologies will capture considerable market share via two simple methodologies; superior technology and offering competitive pricing.  Superior Technology It is clear that nBn Focal Planes provide excellent imaging characteristics at high operating temperatures. The use of the dual band which operates in the Hot_MW-LW using a micro cooler for the all temperature range (200-100K) is very unique to the nBn.  Reduced maintenance and longer service life dual and triple band which include the Hot-MW will significantly reduce maintenance, lowering ownership costs and increasing Yields. This concept of using the HOT-MW as a basic operation at 200K with the ability to cool (when needed) to 100K and acquire the LW images is revolutionary and will result in more robust use, reducing failure points and allowing for service life that is expected to be 200% - 400% longer than current IR cameras.  Competitive Pricing While in small numbers the costs of the nBn cameras will be ~$50,000 each. In larger quantities (lots of 100 or greater), we believe we can reduce the price of the cameras to approximately $35,000 each. This considerable price reduction will be achieved by: 1. Improving wafer yields by developing new process to reduce dark currents and to improve multi-wafer MBE growth which will reduce wafer and FPA prices. 2. Acquiring volume discounts on IDCA subsystem prices (&gt;=100 units) The combination of Superior Technology (nBn), wafer yield improvements and volume discounts on IDCAs will lower the overall cost of the IDCA."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Modulator linearity and efficiency, in addition to bandwidth, are important parameters in characterizing a modulator. In general, improving modulation efficiency is highly desirable since higher modulation efficiency allows lower RF signal to impose equivalent change in the optical beam whereas improved linearity increases the dynamic range available to analog signals conveyed and processed by optical means. The lowering of required input RF power reduces complexity of a system utilizing a modulator by eliminating RF amplifier stages, reduce heat dissipation, and enhance sensitivity; better linearity of modulation suppresses spurs and improves the fidelity of optical transmission and processing. At the same time, modulation efficiency or linearity improvements must not limit the operational frequency, or bandwidth, for the modulator to retain its utility in a given application.BENEFIT:The proposed research effort under this SBIR attains both substantially enhanced efficiency and linearity improvement while preserving the broad bandwidth of operation. It does so by exploiting heretofore unexplored phenomena in the dynamics of electro-optic modulation. As such, the modulators developed under this SBIR program will find application in optical communication and in the nascent field of RF photonics that places premium value on the improved linearity and extended dynamic range of the optical links, while preserving or extending the bandwidth. Such improvements of modulator characteristics may transform the field of RF photonics, which uses optical beams as a medium to convey and process RF signalsparticularly at high frequencies where optical fibers offer significant advantages over conventional RF waveguides in terms of size, weight, and loss."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Lynntech proposes one of a kind Hybrid Additive Manufacturing Machine with Error Rectification (HAMMER), which is exclusively designed to 3D print different material classes (plastics, metals, and ceramics). To efficiently manufacture parts with minimal waste, HAMMER will be equipped with optical precision alignment and feedback control system. Current multimaterial Additive Manufacturing machines are capable of processing only one type of material (e.g. liquid photopolymers). While it allows for creation of functionally graded objects that contain plastic-like and rubber-like sections, it does not permit fabrication of truly hybrid parts. Fabrication of hybrid materials where different classes of materials deposited simultaneously will allow parts to be produced with properties tailored by location. Hybridization and shape complexity promises to significantly improve functionality of manufactured components, reduce their weight, and cut down cost of manufacturing. Lynntechs technology promises fabrication of hybrid 3D components with polymeric, metallic, and ceramic sections. Furthermore, HAMMER will have a capability of self-alignment thus providing geometrically accurate prints.

Using existing inkjet and powder-bed fusion hardware, Multiple-Material Additive Manufacturing (MMAM) will be demonstrated by manufacturing homogeneous metal, nanocomposite, and polymer parts and monolithically integrating heterogeneous parts with graded, temperature-compensated, and fused mechanical interfaces. It will be shown that, as the assemblies are built layer by layer, it is possible to design internal features and passages that could not be cast or machined using more traditional manufacturing approaches. The Phase I effort will also address the need for numeric optimizers and CAD packages that generate the print command files using material and print-hardware parameters.BENEFIT:The ability to place optical, metal dielectric and magneto-dielectric nanocomposites into 3D freeform structures will allow for the innovation to be used both for prototyping and manufacturing complex heterogeneous objects, including lens assemblies, medical devices, tools, automotive parts, and a wide variety of other consumer and industrial products."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project, Modeling Tools for the Machining of Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs), will develop and demonstrate the feasibility of physics-based modeling tools applied to the machining of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) the Air Force needs to machine critical CMC turbine components faster, more accurately, and with lower cost. At the program conclusion, TWS will demonstrate modeling tools capable of identifying the salient process attributes that will result in a 35-50 percent reduction in machining cycle times while maintaining tool life and improving part quality. This will be achieved through the advancement and application of both a detailed-level finite element modeling (FEM) of the tool-workpiece interaction, as well as a toolpath-level analysis of entire part programs. The outputs of these comprehensive models temperatures, residual stresses, forces, damage and power combined with intelligent process optimization algorithms, will provide the ability to predict and manage cutting forces and tool wear while simultaneously reducing machining cost and cycle time and maintaining acceptable part quality. The validated models will take into account the heterogeneous, orthotropic nature of CMC composites through the use of fracture plane models capable of general representation of material toughness in complex orientations.BENEFIT:Existing CAM software tools generate toolpaths entirely based on the geometric aspects of machining, without consideration for the material properties or the process physics such as forces, deflections, etc. leading to a need for significant input from the manufacturing engineers in order to mitigate the above effects. Manufacturing engineers must rely on their machining knowledge and prior experience from related designs and materials. Where such knowledge is not available, the manufacturing engineer has to undergo significant trial-and-error testing to develop a robust process. These methods are expensive, time consuming, and often lead to suboptimal solutions since only a limited range of process alternatives can be explored. Lack of validated modeling tools necessary to understand the magnitude and nature of the machining forces on the final part, temperature and abrasive wear effects on the tool, or workpiece deflection on the final part geometry are significant factors that limit the ability to improve part quality and reduce costs. Similarly, the inability of current software tools such as CAM or verification systems to consider the workpiece material effects during toolpath generation poses additional barriers to rapid, optimal toolpath programming. The anticipated benefits of proposed CMC machining modeling programs: A 35-50 percent reduction in the machining cycle times for Air Force CMC engine components Development of both detailed-level (FEM) and toolpath-level machining models providing a comprehensive, multi-scale physics-based modeling capability Demonstration of process improvements on a candidate Air Force component Dramatic reduction in machining process set-up times via analysis and optimization off-line, in advance of manufacturing process implementation Maximize capabilities of existing capital equipment through tooling and process improvements Eliminate trial-and-error testing through the use of validated physics-based models Improved tool life resulting from the judicious selection of tooling and process parameters as determined from detailed-level analysis Generic models applicable to a wide variety of materials, machine tools and components throughout the DoD"

(ATA) team will develop and verify a model to predict damage created in ceramic matrix composites (CMC) as a result of machining processes. The model will enable the prediction of the useful life of a CMC component as a result of microcracking, fiber bundle rupture, delamination, and damage to the fiber\/matrix interface coating in a silicon carbide reinforced silicon carbide (SiC\/SiC) composites. During the Phase I program the PSI\/ATA team will develop a model to predict the damage imparted to SiC\/SiC materials as a result of contact milling. Initial model predictions will be compared to the existing database of mechanical test data. The model will be used to make predictions about material damage as a function of the feed, speed and tool engagement of a fluted endmill. The model predictions will be verified by performing cyclic fatigue testing on test specimens that are machined using extreme conditions simulated by the model. During Phase II the model will be expanded to include arbitrary fiber architectures, laser machining and waterjet cutting to provide a complete tool for design engineers to model the manufacturing process for SiC\/SiC components.BENEFIT:The successful development of a predictive damage model for machining processes will enable ceramic composite components to be cost effectively manufactured with higher reliability than is currently possible. Increasing the use of ceramic composites in propulsion and aeroshell applications will lead to improved fuel efficiency, higher reliability and an expansion of the performance envelope of Air Force vehicle systems. Many of these benefits will transition into commercial propulsion systems and improve the competitiveness of American propulsion system manufacturers in commercial markets."

These experts have designed and fielded several 1+ meter class radars specifically for weather surveillance using phased array and conventional gimbaled reflector antennas. The team has also fielded tracking software that is deployed worldwide in USAF and other US military forces surveillance radars. Using this expertise, trades on mechanical and electronic scan, single versus dual polarization, single versus dual frequency, single versus multiple faces, and multifunction to include air surveillance versus single weather detection will be completed with quantifiable metrics to make unambiguous recommendations for future PDR implementation. Once the study is completed, this team has all the requisite capabilities to efficiently design, fabricate and demonstrate a complete PDR system in a Phase II follow-on program while ensuring the system is very portable and has a very high hardware and software reliability based on many past experiences with fielded radar system technologies.BENEFIT:There are several phased array based and conventional weather radars that are commercially available today or will be near term. However, none are specifically designed for portability nor are they implemented with ease of maintenance when failures occur. Based on our teams previous experience in the design of 1+ meter class weather radars, we have identified an architecture that has great potential for minimizing system cost while greatly enhancing maintainability and minimizing weight. This candidate architecture will be traded against all other architectures for a final system architecture recommendation mutually concluded with the USAF review team. Through selection of the Agile RF Systems team, the competitive field of suppliers will grow to yield a superior product diversity to the USAF."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:We propose to design, develop, and demonstrate a metasurface-enhanced hyperspectral filter suitable for imaging spectrometry applications. The filter is part of a two-stage solution that integrates a patterned micro-antenna metasurface along with a DBR resonant cavity filter capable of creating an extremely narrow-band spectral response. By combining the two spectral filters into one, the out-of-band mode suppression is greatly improved allowing for a broader range of operation. Material alteration in the filter leads to multiple variations in the filter design, which allows for spectral operation ranging from visible to infrared. Fabrication of the filter can be realized through micro-photolithography fabrication process using standard optical materials. Compared to currently available technology, the proposed design provides size, weight, power (SWaP) advantage over existing systems that utilize bulky, external optical components to achieve similar performance. The filter design will be optimized for fast f\/# systems and made highly compatible with FPAs. Integration of the filter can be achieved by placement into the line of sight or mounted onto the detector to create a compact detecting solution. Applications using this filter range from hyperspectral sensing at longer ranges than current systems, as well as lower cost sensors for agriculture, object recognition, and homeland security.BENEFIT:We expect the design and fabrication of the proposed effort to result in a metasurface-enhanced hyperspectral pixelated filter for use with standard focal plane arrays (FPAs). Using a two-stage light controlling process, the filter is expected to provide narrower line widths under a fast f\/# optical system and be highly scalable for operation at various spectral bands. As a result, the filter will be capable of providing a broader range of operation when compared to the current generation of hyperspectral filters. The fabrication of the proposed filter will be performed using a standard photolithography process, which will result in a compact device that is easily integrated with detectors through a growth or bonding process. Compared to similarly performing hyperspectral filters, this approach is expected to produce a size, weight, and power (SWaP) advantage due to omitting certain bulky optical components. The expected hyperspectral pixelated filter will target both the defense and commercial markets, particularly focusing on object detection, surveillance, remote sensing, defect identification, and chemical imaging."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Hyperspectral imaging is a technique used to simultaneously capture spatial and spectral information of an object scene, making it a valuable technique for applications in remote sensing and military battlefield environments. In the case of long wave infrared (LWIR) imaging, a hyperspectral approach offers an opportunity to improve upon the detection capabilities of standard broadband sensors such as bolometers. Currently, LWIR hyperspectral systems have a large Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) footprint making them difficult to include in practical systems such as those intended for integration into unmanned aerial vehicles. Lumilant is proposing a method for making narrowband LWIR optical filters that can improve the ability of the LWIR sensors to distinguish between a desired signal and self-emitting blackbody radiation. The design and fabrication of such compact optical filters can significantly reduce the SWaP of currently available hyperspectral imaging systems.BENEFIT:Several markets including remote sensing are impacted by the adoption of hyperspectral imaging technologies with benefits to both the commercial and defense industries. Specifically, some commercial applications that may benefit include agriculture, public health, forensics, atmospheric research and disaster management; while some of the government applications that may benefit include landmine detection, chemical weapon identification and intelligence gathering. In addition to the remote sensing applications, the data produced as a result of the growing hyperspectral imaging applications spreads the impact into software and data analysis applications by increasing the demand on improved techniques for acquiring, managing and analyzing data. This widespread impact justifies the advancement of technologies that can provide inexpensive and compact hyperspectral imaging systems."

This solution can be used to analyze and classify avionics systems from the point of view of severity of cyber threats and their potential operational impact.BENEFIT:The proposed avionics vulnerability testing technology is expected to further the field of vulnerability assessment tools in such a way as to provide a state-of-the-art approach to identifying potential and actual vulnerabilities in avionics software and tying them to specific system-level connection points. The project is an ideal fit for BlueRISC and will provide a strong opportunity to not only target government avionics systems but to also transition the technology to the commercial sector, specifically targeting embedded systems, given the broad applicability of the technology."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:We propose wide-angle, large-aperture, high-speed, non-mechanical beam-steering (NMBS) for transmit\/receive of coherent lidar\/ladar beams, to enable high-resolution imaging via synthetic aperture techniques. This is based on the use of state-of-the-art, high-speed, liquid-crystal technology and components. The focus in the SBIR Phase 1 program is to assess the wave-front (phase) distortion for fine-steering and coarse steering application, via measurement of the static and dynamic response of such beam-steering components. In addition, we also provide an optical system model incorporating such elements for use in a SAL system, and also assess other related limitations on image resolution. The proposed work leverages prior and ongoing work at Fibertek, on the use of such NMBS components for high-resolution 3D Imaging direct-detection ladar, as well as coherent lidar systems for high-resolution wind velocity mapping. BENEFIT:(1) High resolution imaging, beyond the diffraction limit of real aperture, for combat-ID and target-ID purpose (2) High-resolution imaging for long ranges(&gt;100s of km), including from space platform. (3) Velocity-field mapping for coherent lidar application for wind-sensing, via scanning line-of-sight lidar beam. (4) Random-access steering for 3D Imaging Ladar, or for free-space lasercom terminals"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:FOMS Inc. proposes to develop revolutionary High Power Robust Optical Deflector (HIPROD) to address the capability gap in non-mechanical beam steering for coherent Synthetic Aperture LADAR (SAL) for the needs of the Air Force. The design is based on a stack of novel optical switching elements with industry proven reliability for aerospace applications and capability of high power handling for desired operating wavelengths around 1.5 microns. The system ideally suits Air Force requirements of random access to steering directions, reduced weight, size and power as well as high speed of beam deflection, low cost and low insertion loss. The proposed approach delivers the capability to address both the system designs with linear and 2D scanning while ensuring the phase preservation for coherent operating mode. In Phase I we will experimentally demonstrate the scanning capability of preliminary HIPROD design with switching speeds higher than 1 kHz and steering increments of less than 1 degree. Design challenges and tradeoffs will be identified. In Phase II the updated HIPROD design will be analyzed for steering efficiency limitations, environmental stability and manufacturability. In order to confirm the compatibility with coherent LADAR systems we will evaluate the HIPROD operation in an arm of interferometer. BENEFIT:The new highly reliable and low cost deflector provides a true 3D acquisition engine for upcoming 3D printing and imaging revolution. The high speed scanning capability will enable real time 3D digitizing of the surrounding areas for proximity awareness in both military and civilian vessels as including driverless cars and small flying residential delivery platforms. A wide variety of applications from virtual reality and gaming to security and safety monitoring will be enabled with this revolutionary system. The ability to handle high operating powers in an eye safe spectral region in combination with small size, weight and power make the system ideal for remote coherent imaging using airborne and orbital platforms."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The simultaneous increase in reliance on electrically enabled military systemsoffensive, defensive, or supportcoupled with the increased proliferation of Electronic Warfare (EW) weapons presents a requirement to mitigate blue force vulnerabilities to red force capacities and inadvertent friendly EW fire and electromagnetic interference (EMI). The traditional route of statically shielding and hardening individual circuit elements can be effective, but is costly and often reduces performance. Once a systems functionality is fully developed, architectural elements that enable circumvention and recovery should be capable of being introduced to protect the vulnerable electronics. Nokomis intends to knit together individually mature, but disparate capabilities into a comprehensive circumvent and recover framework that addresses this problem. At the end of the Phase I, Nokomis intends to demonstrate a test bench concept that proves the ability to successfully and harmoniously coordinate the interaction of these critical elements into a coherent and effective circumvent and recover solution.BENEFIT:Electromagnetic attack is a rather specialized threat to consider, but it is becoming more common. Nokomis firmly envisions this product being useful to detect electromagnetic assaults or accidental discharges of high energy systems. This will be applicable to the Department of Energy, the biomedical industry, the telecommunications industry, the financial industry, etc. This is especially true of anywhere a loss of function can result in significant loss of life and where there are competing, or adversarial, interests. Of particular interest are SCADA systems as well as any facility that would be vulnerable to electromagnetic discharge, including high-power smart energy grids. Other commercial applications of this research would be in satellite development and tracking of solar events that can routinely disable electronic systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The Goleta Star team proposes to develop innovative waveforms and exploitation algorithms for concurrent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ground moving target indication (GMTI) in contested A2AD environments. In Phase I we will evolve the detailed design of the radar waveforms and processing such that in Phase 2 we can demonstrate the waveforms and processing in a flyable prototype of the system enabling the collection of relevant SAR GMTI data. We will design transmit signals and exploitation algorithms for simultaneous SAR and GMTI processing. We will explore Doppler-tolerant waveforms like Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) and others. We will develop and test these with the help of simulation and hardware. Using innovative approaches the team will develop signature exploitation concepts for concurrent SAR and GMTI for multiple moving and stationary targets detection, geolocation, and tracking. Goleta Star has been designing and flite testing small MMW band SAR GMTI radars for over ten years. The team has all the capability necessary to rapidly design, develop, build, flite test and produce the desired radar waveforms and processing with a fast track path to commercialization.BENEFIT:The key benefits to the warfighters will be: (a) transmit signals can hide in adversaries environment but enable ISR objectives, (b) solve the joint SAR and GMTI problem without complexities associated with reconfiguring the radar systems for SAR or GMTI mode, and (c) make this affordable for transition to the critical end users."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Under this Phase 1 SBIR research, Systems and Technology Research (STR) will develop advanced radar waveforms, radar modes, and received signal processing algorithms to accomplish simultaneous SAR and GMTI leading to improved move-stop-move target tracking. The joint SAR\/GMTI radar mode will make efficient use of the RF spectrum. The waveforms will be designed for use in MIMO radar, will be Doppler tolerant to reduce computational burden for target detection, and will be LPI\/LPD for use in contested A2AD environments. Our approach looks for viable solutions from within the class of spread-spectrum-coded LFM waveforms. The research will address mitigation of self-jamming through both waveform design\/scheduling and post-processing of received signals. Under Phase 1, performance analysis will be conducted using high fidelity RF simulation. Selected waveforms and processing approaches from Phase 1 will be implemented in hardware and flight tested in Phase 2 using a digital receiver\/exciter and radar being developed under separate effort. The product of this research consists of radar waveform\/mode designs and post-processing algorithms for improved target tracking performance. The research products may be packaged as an upgrade to an existing fielded radar or may become a component of a developmental radar to be fielded in the future.BENEFIT:The anticipated benefit is to provide a unified SAR\/GMTI radar mode that will support longer track life for move-stop-move targets. The radar mode includes orthogonal LPI\/LPD waveform designs for use in contested A2AD environments as well as target detection\/clutter mitigation algorithms for post-processing of received signals. The commercial application is to package this mode as an upgrade to an existing fielded radar and\/or to include the mode as a component of a developmental radar for future transition."

Key characteristics of our proposed AFCRISP waveform are: (a) Integrate properties of direct sequence spread spectrum and LFM waveforms, (b) Remain orthogonal on both transmit (if MIMO) and receive; (c) Can be designed to be (or operate as) LPI while in contested environments. Two additional important features of the AFCRISP signals, when properly processed using our two-mode reception, are: (a) Exploitation capabilities of LFM waveforms (i.e., Doppler tolerant as it remain delay-orthogonal under arbitrary Doppler); (b) High bandwidth and high processing gain of DSSS, used to achieve high resolution imaging to separate weak from close-apart strong targets. Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes to develop and characterize the performance of the proposed AFCRISP waveform using analysis, simulation and experimentation over actual RF using IAI&apos;s RFnest test tool with hardware\/RF-in-the-loop and model-based wireless environment emulation. In Phase II, we will develop exploitation algorithms for affordable ISR systems that could fully leverage the novel AFCRISP features to provide tactical edge advantage in A2AD contested environment. BENEFIT:This novel technology will enable extend the use of LFM waveforms to contested\/anti-access area denial (A2AD) environment and will find wide use for military applications to improve the effectiveness of ISR systems by improved signal to clutter and noise ratio, while providing ultra high resolution to discern a weak target close to a strong target for both SAR and GMTI exploitation."

We will also investigate the simultaneous operation of the two SAR-GMTI systems on a given platform via exploiting multiple orthogonal radar signaling (MIMO). In Phase I of our investigation, we will develop a multi-dimensional signal theory foundation to accurately model the radar-moving target interaction and the resultant measured SAR data. We then exploit these models to develop simulation algorithms and data for the above-mentioned SAR-GMTI systems for testing in moving target detection, geolocation and tracking methods.BENEFIT:The anticipated result from the successful completion of this project will be a set of basic principles and algorithms that would help the Air Force to determine practical limitations as well as strengths of the major modes of SAR-GMTI platform to infer moving target information on the ground from an airborne or spaceborne radar platform."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This proposal addresses the problem of geolocating moving targets (GMTI) from data sets collected as part of an imaging program such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). A linear frequency modulation (LFM) waveform from a moving platform that contains both the transmitter and the receiver (monostatic case) is envisioned here. Combining Along-track Interferometry (ATI) and Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) can often yield accurate target geolocations. However many system parameters may not support both these approaches simultaneously. In those cases where the number of spatial degrees of freedom are limited, but multiple phase centers are available, target geolocations can still be obtained by exploiting the available data. In this proposal we discuss an interferogram based approach and as an example illustrate its utility to measured radar data. Incorporating both spatial and temporal prior information for reducing false alarms is another important task that C&amp;P planes to address during the Phase I period. Associated computational complexity for real-time implementation is another task that will be addressed during the proposed effort.BENEFIT:The proposed Phase I effort will provide the necessary key algorithms\/methods for detection, geolocation and tracking of moving targets using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In particular, the proposed effort will address how to perform target detection and geolocation using SAR. The proposed Phase I effort will offer the necessary key algorithms\/methods for integration of the proposed algorithms into current SAR radar system. Commercial applications include improved the current radar system performance for border patrol, drug traffic monitoring, perimeter surveillance and air traffic control applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:QuNav proposes to develop a GNSS Universal Anti-spoofing Receiver Design (GUARD) technology. GUARD will be implemented as an agile software-defined radio that separates the correlation engine from the signal processor. This allows for the implementation of GNSS signal correlation as a (reconfigurable) hardware while the rest of baseband signal processing is implemented in software. As a result, multi-GNSS signal processing will be implemented as an add-on to MGUE capabilities (i.e., by incorporating additional separate software-defined correlation engines and processing software modules) and without modifying correlation processing of secure military signals. A four-level protection scheme will be applied to multi-GNSS signals for spoofing identification and exclusion. This scheme operates at (i) pre-correlation level with baseband GNSS signal samples; (ii) post-correlation (i.e., IQ) level; (iii) measurement level, and (iv) solution level. Open-service GNSS signals will be fused into the overall PNT estimation only if they pass through this four-level protection scheme. To improve resiliency of MGUE, MGUE will be fused with validated multi-GNSS data both at signal-processing fusing (via mutual aiding for extended signal accumulation), and measurement level. Phase I will full develop the GUARD receiver mechanization, will validate it with simulated and experimental data, and will initially design a prototyping approach.BENEFIT:The GUARD technology has great potential for both military and private sector applications. Many military missions require a higher level assurance for PNT solutions accuracy, availability, integrity, and continuity in face of jamming and spoofing. In addition to DoD applications, protection of multi-GNSS signals against spoofing and their combined use in signal-degraded environments are also directly applicable to civil applications where intentional and unintentional interference becomes a growing concern. We will pursue commercialization for both DoD and civil applications. The main approach is to use Phase I and Phase II efforts to demonstrate the technology and then transition it to military systems and commercial products via licensing and acquisition."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To take advantage of different properties of electronic material systems, hybrid circuits have been previously developed for some applications, such as high frequency DC-DC convertors and high power amplifiers. There are further advantages in monolithic integration of different material systems, including improved device performance and reliability, and reduced size and weight, which are all very important for satellite payloads. In this program, we propose to monolithically integrate high frequency InGaAs-based HEMTs grown on Si(100) with high-power GaN-based HEMTs, using a proprietary metal buffer developed for low-defect growth of GaN films. The main goal is to combine three key capabilities including 1) deposition of lattice matched metal buffers, 2) growth of high quality GaN and InGaAs epitaxial films, and 3) fabrication of high performance GaN- and InGaAs-based transistors, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of producing monolithically integrated microwave circuits (MIMCs) that can take advantage of unique properties of up to 3 material systems (GaN, GaAs, and Si) on large diameter Si(100) substrates.BENEFIT:Monolithic integration of wide bandgap GaN-base electronic devices with high frequency InGaAs-based devices, can result in high performance, more reliable, and lower cost electronic circuits for many civilian, scientific, and military applications, including broad band high power amplifiers (HPAs) and high efficiency power management electronics, as well as lighter and less bulky electronic payload for satellites."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The Air Force recognizes the need to monolithically integrate microelectronic devices constructed with dissimilar semiconductor materials on the same substrates, thus significantly reducing parts count and with the goal to develop a space qualifiable compound MMIC that can lead to construction of low noise\/high speed circuits based on InGaAs HEMT technology monolithically integrated with power amplifiers based on GaN HEMT technology on the same substrates. To date there is no optimized transistor materials technology with both high power RF and low noise operation. In response to this need QuantTera proposes to develop an exciting new class of InP-GaN based monolithically integrated heterojunction materials, which form the basis for an ultra-high performance transistor materials technology for monolithically integrated MMICs. BENEFIT:There are several major markets where high performance integrate InGaAs-GaN HEMTs can make an immediate impact: (1) RF amplifiers for commercial telecommunications, (2) radar and directed communications for the military. Of these two primary markets that InGaAs-GaN HEMTs can target, this project impacts most directly the first of these, which is also the one that offers the largest potential commercial impact due to the extremely large potential volumes involved."

The study will include active load pull testing of transistors for each studied process to support the development of accurate transistor non linear models. Utilizing the results from these measurements and novel matching network structures, ENGIN-IC will develop highly linear LNAs into two separate processes that achieve the objective noise requirement of 2 dB at +70 C while improving linearity performance significantly over other commercially available product. A space qualification plan will also be developed for execution under a future phase of the program.BENEFIT:The completed projects will significantly improve linearity performance compared to other LNA products currently offered while achieving the noise figure requirements. These will enable significant improvements in receive dynamic range. ENGIN-IC will offer the product in its standard product catalog as both bare die and packaged devices with both military and space qualifications. There are numerous applications that will utilize the developed technology including satellite communication systems, point to point and multipoint radios, various military radar receivers, and many more."

This represents a reduction of nominally 0.5 to 1.0 dB over newly announced MMICs, and 1 to 2 dB reduction relative to commercial LNAs. WGS and AEHF satellite receivers are the near-term application. In addition there is a continuing need for front-end components to exploit the increasingly crowded Ka-band and Q-band spectrums for both space and terrestrial government and commercial communications links. The LNAs will be compact, have minimal power consumption, and be producible. They will be operable over the -20 oC to +70 oC range, and can be expected to have very low noise temperatures when operated at cryogenic temperatures. The proposed technology, 50 nm InP MHEMTs grown on GaAs, will have a path to space-qualification i.e. high reliability and radiation-hardened. The noise figure, gain, power consumption and dynamic range, and other characteristics will be investigated. Additional circuitry such as on-MMIC linearization and interstage gain-control will be simulated as improvements in dynamic range and allowance for temperature compensation.BENEFIT:The near-term, driving, application of the ultra-low-noise amplifiers is efficient WGS and AEHF satellite uplink reception in the target bands. In general, government and military applications include satellite downlink and uplink reception of spectrally efficient waveforms, Satcom-On-The-Go, satellite-to-satellite links, full-waveguide bandwidth weather and ice-coverage observation, radio astronomy (low-power consumption cooled and cryogenic LNAs), battlefield communications, and secure communications. Dual-use applications include commercial Satcom fixed and mobile reception. The technology is transferrable to communications applications in general."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The Ka-band SATCOM systems offer potential for transportable and mobile communications through the effective use of the wide bandwidths available while requiring that adequate linearity performance be maintained. In environments where size and power conservation is of high importance, power consumption and heat dissipation in the power amplifier (PA) must be minimized. However, it is widely accepted that linearity and efficiency are competing constraints. To address these challenges, MaXentric Technologies proposes a cost-effective envelope tracking Ka-band power amplifier, GETSAT (GreenAmp Envelope Tracking for SATCOM), for high efficiency satellite transmitters, capable of greater than 70W of output power over 29-31 GHz with greater than 35% efficiency. The technology supports QPSK and QAM signals, as well as others. To achieve high linearity while simultaneously maintaining high efficiency, GreenAmp envelope tracking with MaXPAL (MaXentrics PA Linearizer) will be used. Cost, size, weight, and power are of prime importance for these mobile SATCOM ground terminals. Our strategy throughout the program will improve our project prototypes on other performance parameters such as output power, operating voltage, output power, power-added-efficiency (PAE) and the response speed of the control circuitry with wideband operation. The success of our approach will depend on successful developments in wideband modulators and process integration with GaN MMICs.BENEFIT:MaXentrics proposed techniques for developing high efficiency Ka-band power amplifier with high linearity directly addresses design constraints with GreenAmps envelope tracking technology in conjunction MaXPALs real-time digital pre-distortion, a key-enabler technology. The U.S. government is interested in commercial satellite services for a variety of applications, including emergency response, remote locations, video broadcast, distance learning, and continuity of operations. The Ka-band satellite systems offer potential for transportable and mobile communications due to the wide bandwidths available and the high gain achievable with small antennas. GETSAT (GreenAmp Envelope Tracking for SATCOM) has the potential for improving the communication link performance, power, and spectrum efficiency of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T), and Defense Communications and Army Transmission (DCAT). Additionally, this technology can be leveraged by portable manpacks and radios carried by the warfighters so as to prolong battery usage and eliminate existing cooling systems by achieving high efficiency and linearity simultaneously. Commercial applications that benefit for these capabilities provided by GETSAT include cellular phone usage, direct-to-home television service, Internet (satellite systems can deliver pictures and video 200 times faster than a typical modem and telephone line), video conferencing, private data networks, telemedicine, content distribution, interactive games, and more."

The proposed amplifier offers three unique attributes: 1. Utilizes a high power GaN process operating at 20 to 28 volts and which achieves output power density &gt; 4 W\/mm. PA single MMIC output power of 12 to 16W across 30 to 31 GHz will reduce the complexity of the combiner network. 2. The PA incorporates inverse class F matching to achieve output stage power-added efficiency exceeding 60%. 3. The PA incorporates a MIT- and UTD-developed outphasing power combining subsystem realized in waveguide that maintains efficient performance into backoff without introducing baseband signal processing complexity. These attributes are incorporated together into a low cost modular packaging approach that offers excellent thermal performance. In order to improve first pass success, accurate nonlinear transistor models will be developed and verified for multiple foundries through active load pull techniques.BENEFIT:The project will result in a significant improvement to transmitter efficiency and cost for power amplifiers providing a great advantage to low cost ground terminal systems. As well as the military applications for WGS mentioned, there are many commercial and space applications for all or portions of this approach. These include deep space exploration, missile seeker transmit PAs, commercial airline SATCOM for connectivity when flying overseas, and many more. As noted in the proposal, there are prime suppliers that are very interested in the technology."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:QuinStar Technology proposes to develop a high-efficiency, linear, solid-state power amplifier (SSPA), operating at Ka-band frequencies, for low-cost ground terminals. The key performance goals are an output power of 70 W with an associated PAE of 35%, while operating with complex modulation. These goals will be achieved by employing three major innovations. First, we are employing state-of-the-art wide bandgap GaN (Gallium Nitride) devices. These GaN devices have demonstrated power densities of 5 to 8 times higher than competing technologies, GaAs or InP devices. Further, we are proposing to operate these devices in a switching mode (Class F). Simulations presented in this proposal indicate that by using this approach, drain efficiencies approaching 70% are possible. Secondly, we are proposing to utilize a low loss, H-tee combining approach to combine 4 of these high-efficiency chips to achieve 70 watts. Finally, we plan to utilize envelope tracking (ET) to maintain the amplifier in saturation, operating at highest efficiency, and then use Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) to linearize the resulting amplifier characteristics. Simulations described in this proposal indicate that with this innovative approach, we can simultaneously achieve the output power, linearity and efficiency goals of this program.BENEFIT:High-efficiency, linear power amplifiers are required for Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) ground based terminals and for AF airborne terminals. Linearity is required in order to prevent spectral regrowth, i.e., extraneous power from one channel interfering with signals in adjacent channels, and high efficiency is required to minimize both power consumption and self-heating, which in turn causes thermal stress. Currently available Ka-band solid-state amplifiers simply do not have the combination of output power, efficiency and linearity required for this application. The efficiency SOA for Ka-band MMICs is in the range of 25%. With practical packaged amplifiers, including matching and combining networks, the amplifier efficiency rarely exceeds 15%, and is even less when operated as a linear amplifier. Employing an innovative switching-mode amplifier concept in conjunction with Envelop Tracking (ET) and DPD linearization, our approach produces a SOA high-efficiency, linear power amplifier. Military applications for high-efficiency, linear amplifier technology include SATCOM applications for the Army in the 29.5 to 31 GHz band, and radar applications for all the military services in the Ka radar bands. There is also a need to replace aging SATCOM satellites such as MILSTAR, with broader ground coverage and increased data throughout. Once again, the same set of amplifier requirements exists higher output power and higher efficiency at Ka-band frequencies. Potential commercial and industrial applications for this technology are summarized below:  Ka-band satellite communications. Ground terminal manufacturers are utilizing SSPAs to replace tubes in the 27 to 31 GHz frequency range, with power levels ranging from 10 W to over 1000 W. This market has experienced explosive growth in the last few years with the exploitation of Ka-band for satellite-based broadband communication. The PA (tube and SSPA) market size of this segment is estimated to be $100M\/yr with over a dozen major suppliers of tubes and SSPAs.  Airborne terminals for Broadband Access in commercial airliners using SARCOM (27 to 31 GHz). This is a new market which is just now evolving. The estimated market size is 10M\/yr. and growing rapidly.  Ka-band Deep Space communications for NASA at 31.8-32.3 GHz for downlink and 34.2-34.7 GHz for uplink  Emerging Ka-band communications applications in new frequency bands. For example, 38-39 GHz for ESAs Alphasat program  Weather and environmental monitoring radars operating in the 34 to 36 GHz band. There are airborne and ground-based applications. Potential customers include commercial instrument makers, avionics, etc.  NASA Earth science missions including Ka-band radar for cloud measurements, weather and climate variability studies. Since these sensors are airborne or satellite based, they would also benefit from this high-efficiency technology.  Emerging aircraft landing systems to enhance or replace Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) with EVFS. Imaging and mapping. Frequency: 35 GHz. SSPAs are a superior option to tubes.  Security and Surveillance radars for commercial, industrial and municipal applications. These modern radar-based sensors present much higher resolution and ranging than other sensors.  Helicopter collision avoidance radars for brown-out and obstacle avoidance."

The program will utilize innovative Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and microresonator (MR) based structures to create circulators with high isolation, low loss and wide bandwidth.

The program will also investigate high port count circulator devices and unique optical functionalities they can provide when combined with a series of advanced optical components.BENEFIT:The novel integrated photonic optical circulators developed in this SBIR program will play a vital role in future photonic integrated circuit (PIC) devices for use in DoD and commercial applications. High isolation with low loss and wide bandwidth are key enabling features of this technology, which are essential for high performance operation of future PIC devices. The program will also develop TE mode circulators for silicon photonics based PICs, enabling the vast majority of lasers and other TE mode devices integrated onto advanced PI devices. These new PIC devices will then create unique photonic capabilities for future DoD systems that cannot be achieved with electronic only systems, while also significantly reducing the cost, size weight and power of these future systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Heavily leveraging fabrication and processing technology from the semiconductor industry, significant advances have been made in the area of photonic integration. As many of the functions currently implemented electronically are replaced with optical elements, these photonic integrated circuits (PICs) enable new capabilities and reduction in size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP). One optical function that has proven difficult to integrate is optical isolation where the optical transmission or insertion loss through a component is highly direction dependent. Isolators are critical elements for optical systems, since backscattered light creates noise and laser source instability, particularly in integrated platforms where the potential for backscattering increases with device density. The optical isolators and circulator to be developed in this program are also useful for true time delay (TTD) for radar beam forming from phased arrays and communications where bi-directionally propagating signals must be separated. In this project, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) will team with the research groups of Profs. Juejun Hu and Caroline Ross at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop, demonstrate, and commercialize a fully integrated three-port optical circulator based on thin-film magneto-optic crystalline material coupled to silicon waveguides.BENEFIT:The integrated optical circulator technology to be developed in this effort will be an enabling component for photonic integrated circuits by reducing optical reflections and separating bidirectional signals. The technology will improve capabilities in communications, signal processing, sensing, and advanced electronic systems such as radar. Replacing key subsystems with optical equivalents will enable increased efficiency, reduced size, and enhanced performance."

Since LADARs are usually used on moving platforms, the insensitivity of the laser to vibration and acceleration is extremely important. In addition, there is a need in sub-kHz linewidth, small footprint, highly coherent diode lasers with long term frequency stability which would be beneficial in many areas of optics including radio frequency (RF) photonic link applications, communications, metrology, and spectroscopy. The objective of Phase I of this SBIR project is to define and develop a design, and demonstrate a protoype model of a low noise, narrow-linewidth laser\/master oscillator for coherent LADAR system applications on air platforms.BENEFIT:The anticipated market segments for the 2 Micron ultra-low frequency noise semiconductor laser source include carbon dioxide and other gas destection, coherent LIDAR, frequency conversion, optical metrology and spectroscopy, as well as free-space optical communication applications. The lasers can be of great interest for insertion into airborne and space applications. Since the proposed technology can be easily extended to different wavelengths, the narrow linewidth lasers also could be useful for oil and gas exploration, structural health monitoring, security and sensing, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, and various other fiber optic sensing markets. All these market segments need laser sources with improved phase\/frequency noise performance in smaller, less expensive packages."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Abstract: Electromagnetic signals used in communications and sensor systems can be seriously impacted after propagation through a region of the atmosphere or ionosphere disturbed by turbulence. This work will develop new physics-based technology that calculates EM propagation from HF to laser frequencies, including the effects of turbulence with long correlation length in the direction of propagation. The work will combine the existing NWRA ray-trace code with a new 3D multiple phase screen calculation that will run on Air Force high power computers to achieve improvement by factors of 10 to 100 in spatial and temporal resolution. The end product will calculate realizations of the propagating EM field, including the effects of refraction, reflection, magneto-ionic coupling, and ionospheric and atmospheric turbulence.BENEFIT:Commercial benefits: This 3D EM propagation code will support sensor and communication systems including NGOTHR, MUOS, P-band space based radar, directed energy systems, high-energy laser, airborne laser weapon systems, tactical laser, cruise missile, ballistic missile, and drone defense and directed energy weapons. This support is valuable and will allow improved system development with comprehensive mitigation of propagation disturbances."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The DoD requires accurate real-time knowledge of ionospheric variability in order to reduce one of the biggest error sources inherent in the use of critical systems such as Over the Horizon Radar (OTHR). OTHR is particularly susceptible to TIDs which are underspecified by current methods. In the proposed work, we will develop physics-based models for generation of 3D coherent and random density irregularities with long range spatial correlation properties associated with and driven by Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances. We will study the feasibility of a numerical toolbox for evaluation of TID impacts on the performance of NGOTH radars. This work will leverage ASTRAs existing coordinate registration software tool (CRICKET) by augmenting the ionospheric specification with electron density structures from a physics-based model and measured TID characteristics. We will also augment an existing ray tracing capability by adding a wave-optics approach. A preliminary wave-optics-based HF propagation model will be developed to investigate the importance of diffractive effects compared to refractive ray tracing for radio waves propagating through the plasma structures.BENEFIT:At the conclusion of our proposed Phase I effort, we will have investigated all of the critical technology areas necessary for successfully developing a fully mature software environment and validated user toolkit. The benefits of the proposed effort are that it uses a physics-based model of the ionosphere (PBMOD). This model permits not only the simulation of coherent TID wave structures, but also for the first time the coupling of the TIDs to bulk, field-aligned structures in the ionosphere, and the cascading of random plasma turbulence to scale sizes smaller than the mesoscale TID waves themselves. The work also benefits from the inclusion of wave-optics solutions to HF oblique propagation through these structured plasma volumes versus the standard ray tracing methods that have several shortcomings discussed in the proposal. By the end of Phase-I, we will have integrated the new plasma structure and propagation models into a prototype user support tool for improving OTHR coordinate registration and reducing geolocation errors. Potential commercial applications include DoD for OTHR and other applications, other agencies such as IARPA for geolocation, as well as commercial HF operators."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:ANTEOS, Inc proposes to develop an innovative technology for holographic recording of relief-free Volume Phase Diffractive Optical Elements (VPDOE) for high power laser systems, including laser cavity optics for VECSELs, based on ZnSe semiconductor material, which is well transparent from the visible to long-wave infrared wavelengths between 480 nm and 14 microns. A proprietary process of photo-modification irreversibly changing refractive index of the semiconductor material under illumination with low intensity light is used for direct optical recording of the relief-free VPDOE structure at room temperature. Because no foreign material is introduced during processing of the semiconductor, the fabricated VPDOEs should exhibit high temperature stability as well as resistance to laser damage and harsh environment. In Phase I of the project, we will prove feasibility of the proposed concept by optical recording of model relief-free VPDOEs, demonstrating their beam focusing performance, and temperature stability. In Phase II, the prototype VPDOEs for MWIR laser cavities will be fabricated, tested, optimized and delivered to DoD for implementation in its missions. BENEFIT:One-step optical recording is less labor intensive than traditional grinding, polishing or etching and offers considerable cost reduction due to saving the expensive ZnSe material. This creates strong competitive advantage for commercialization of the developed technology. In addition to immediate military applications of the VPDOEs in laser cavities for infrared countermeasures, remote sensing and monitoring, target detection and ranging, free space optical communication, detection of chemicals, the proposed relief-free diffractive optics having improved performance, high resistance to laser damage and harsh environments will find many industrial, scientific and medical applications, including spectral devices and detectors, chemical spectroscopy, industrial process and material quality control, environmental monitoring, trace gas identification and analysis, semiconductor lasers and telecom semiconductor devices, optical memory and laser mode tuning, material laser processing and medical surgery."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To meet the Air Force need for a high-quality, high-efficiency, robust diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs) that can be used in VECSEL cavities in place of external bulk mirrors, Luminit, LLC, proposes to develop a novel Computer Generated Hologram (CGH) based Improved VECSEL Cavity (CIVC) based on Luminits cascaded computer designed diffractive elements, a new concept that has already been proved and published. The CIVC uses cascaded CGH technology to provide both a quality beam by shaping modes and control over output with a beam shaper function. The addition of extra CGHs to a single one will enhance the performance merits, as imposed by the user. Thus, CIVC will be an innovative high-power laser cavity design using combination of new algorithms on diffractive optics field and with significantly reduced SWAP. In Phase I, Luminit will first prove the principle of the CIVC with an elobrate software and a breadboard prototype. During Phase II, Luminit plans to mount the CIVC to a semiconductor laser chip to TRL 6 and develop a transition plan leading to limited rate production soon afterwards.BENEFIT:The CIVC will be immediately applicable to classical external bulk laser mirrors for DoD applications as infrared countermeasures (IRCM) and active laser sensing for airborne systems, as solicitated. Commercially, it will be useful in optical fiber data transmission, analog broadband signal transmission, absorption spectroscopy, laser printers and bio-photonics such as biological tissue analysis."

This innovation will improve the stability of Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VECSEL) systems as well as other types of solid state laser systems. The developed DOEs for efficient laser cavities will be designed to improve the operational characteristics, resulting in improved stability and robustness, as well as reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of VECSELs. The VECSELs will be capable of generating a variety of wavelength from visible through infrared by incorporating innovative DOEs as part of the laser cavities. The DOEs may be bonded directly to the semiconductor structure of VECSELs to improve the robustness and significantly reduce the size and weight of the package. The DOEs can also be directly fabricated as surface relief micro-structures onto the outer layer of the VECSEL semiconductor material employing well-established lithographic techniques. This approach further improves the VECSELs manufacturability, as well as increases the registration accuracy of the laser cavity mirrors with respect to the laser gain medium, eliminating costly and sensitive active alignment processes during VECSEL production.BENEFIT:1. Improved stability and operational robustness of Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VECSEL) systems as well as other types of solid state lasers. 2. Significantly reduced size, weight, and power (SWAP) of VECSEL systems. 3.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The GATER processing framework was originally developed to support full motion video (FMV) data sources. The software has been very successful in this domain, and is now relatively mature after 3 years of development. Extensions are required to the GATER framework when targeting OPIR data sources. Challenges unique to OPIR data render the processing problem fundamentally different than that for FMV data. These differences include low-level sensor differences, differences in the platforms typically used to acquire OPIR data, and differences in the exploitable scene contents. Etegent has developed a variety of algorithms that address concerns pertinent to the OPIR tracking problem, such as expectation maximization principal component background suppression, kernel based super-resolution dejittering. These tools as well as a few novel approaches have been identified as candidates to enhance the robustness of OPIR GATER for a variety of data products. Additionally, not all approaches are suitable for all OPIR sensors or surveilled scenes, which implicitly require the proposed modeling of the system performance in order to optimize the system as a function of the operating conditions.BENEFIT:The research conducted under this Phase I effort will lay the groundwork for the fuller development of a suite of efficient, scalable tracking algorithms within the GATER framework under a Phase II effort, and for evaluation of tracker efficiency under differing operating conditions. Several of the algorithms being considered for development under this Phase I effort will also have more specific, immediate applicability outside of the context of this project as well."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Automated detection and tracking of moving objects in OPIR data is a difficult problem due to low GSD, low contrast, sensor artifacts, and other challenges, and many standard approaches will not produce sufficient result quality. A robust tracking solution, however, is highly desirable to aid analysts in the automated exploitation of OPIR data. Our proposed approach leverages deep learning to build a highly effective spatial-temporal feature set to support detection and tracking. Furthermore, we will incorporate multiple sources of information, such as GIS data, along with the pixel data to produce contextual layers. The purpose of these layers is to identify areas of the scene, such as clouds or oceans, that can aid or hinder the detection, tracking, and classification of moving vehicles. We will leverage Kitwares existing government open source Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) software infrastructure, which supports real time processing and already has components integrated into GATER, as a baseline implementation and a framework for our proposed approach. Kitware will continue to deliver software developed on the effort with unlimited rights to the government.BENEFIT:Target detection and tracking in OPIR data is an important capability for analysts, such as those at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center or the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. Manually detecting targets in OPIR data is difficult and time consuming, and significant human resources must be expended to build an intelligence product with manual tracks. The proposed technology will provide an automated tracking system for OPIR and related data that, when deployed, will dramatically reduce analyst workload and enable defense and military applications to be more timely and robust, resulting in much higher-quality intelligence. Additionally, the proposed technology has great commercial value beyond military intelligence, with potential applications in retail forecasting and logistics analysis; urban planning and environmental impact studies; insurance claim and fraud appraisal; and disaster response measurement. The technology will help address the lack of high-quality satellite video tools and provide commercial entities with a hardened, automatic system for video analysis and particularly mover tracking. This will result in significantly improved abilities to automatically produce saleable information from satellite video data."

Monoenergetic (combined) e\/p beams can be used to verify the physics interaction models, which then can be driven by the actual radiation environment for one\/many orbits of interest. Our Idark distribution simulations across the FPA will provide the necessary data to determine real-time sensor SNR and target detection thresholds. Our innovative approach is to use existing simulation codes, but focused on high fidelity modeling of multiple defect types possible in InGaAs detector material, so the complete noise distribution can be determined and represented in Mission analysis. To quantify the impact of these defects on the detector pixel at the physics level, we will use SoA 3D device modeling, which has been already implemented and validated by tests performed by NRL. Phase 1 will evaluate the relative importance of the known GaAs defects and enable an efficient Phase 2 demonstration of a space environment-to-LF Array noise distributions prediction. These open source tools can be commercializated, but key insights and material constants are the IP.

This hybrid design will effectively perform digital injection for detector samples outside the IRSP coverage, extending it to 4Kx4K samples or better, with minimal impact to existing 7V\/10V facilities.

Current space sensor test facilities are incapable of fully testing state-of-the-art high-resolution WFOV sensors without infrastructure modifications. The test methodology described in this proposal focuses on testing only a subset of the FPA, along with the necessary analysis to validate the approach of using FPA characteristics from the tested portion to characterize the entire FPA. Once the entire is FPA is adequately characterized using statistics from the subset of the FPA, a test methodology is described that enables the testing of a sensor under mission conditions.BENEFIT:The work under this SBIR proposal will provide a testing methodology for focal plane arrays whose properties exceed the capabilities of current test facility infrastructure. In addition to enabling testing of these focal plane arrays, the methodology is also applicable to validation of Models and Simulations. Commercialization potential includes testing of focal planes for both government and commercial space sensors, as well as in the areas of medical imaging and surveillance."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In response to Department of defense SBIR topic AF151-175, Alphacore Inc. will develop a camera system for multiscale gigapixel photography that will allow synchronized detectors to capture digital images of fragments moving at up to 9000 feet per second to determine fragment size and shape in warhead arena testing. Alphacores approach is to develop a triggerable, high speed CMOS imaging chip that is optimized for this purpose and build a multi-chip camera-system that uses 25 100 of these novel chips. The developed chip enables capturing sharp images with less than 1 &amp;#61549;s integration time, synchronized with a timing accuracy better than 10 ns over all pixel sensors used to form the full image. The significance of this innovation is that there currently exists a critical need for these types of cameras capable of imaging fast moving fragments in warhead arena testing. The first full camera prototype will have twenty-five 4 megapixel (Mpixel) chips synchronized to form 100-megapixel images. In this proposal, Alphacore describes the innovative imager chip and a camera system that is capable of providing the requested features. BENEFIT:The developed camera system will provide Air Force the needed capability for their weapons testing. In addition, since the proposed novel technologies make it possible to build compact, high-speed, few hundred megapixel to gigapixel cameras, excellent commercial potential can be expected for the developed products. One of the main objectives of the U.S. SBIR program is to encourage small businesses to market the SBIR technology in the private sector which, in turn, helps stimulate the U.S. economy. Alphacores novel, single-unit system that pushes the state-of-the-art in performance will have superior commercial potential as compared to much larger multi-unit systems that other companies may propose under this SBIR topic. In the defense sector, high speed digital cameras have been used in development of various weapon systems, as an example to study how mines dropped from the air will deploy in near shore regions, and to capture ballistic intercepts. past years, the modern high speed digital cameras with 4 megapixel resolution recording at 1500 fps have been replacing the high speed film cameras used on tracking mounts on test ranges that capture ballistic intercepts"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Heat transfer is an important quantity that remains difficult to predict using CFD. Phenomena such as transition and separation are difficult to capture with discrete sensors. Temperature-Sensitive Paint is an image-based technology that has been used for over 25 years to acquire measurements of surface temperature and heat flux in a variety of flows. The major limitation to deploying TSP systems in AEDC Tunnel B\/C, where temperatures are between 600 F and 2000 F, is the availability of an appropriate TSP. Standard TSPs utilize polymer materials that will not survive long-duration testing at elevated temperatures while traditional phosphor-based TSPs employ coatings that cannot be removed without damaging the model surface. Recently, ISSI has developed phosphor-based TSP systems that address these issues. The TSP system is composed of a surface layer of a carbon compound that is over sprayed with a phosphor based TSP in a high temperature binder. The carbon compound adheres to the surface, but is non-reactive at elevated temperatures. Removal of the TSP system is accomplished using a Teflon spatula and then the carbon layer is removed using Acetone. The objective of this proposal is to deploy a TSP-based system for acquiring heat flux measurements in Tunnel B\/C.BENEFIT:A system that can provide global measurements of heat flux on a model in a high temperature wind tunnel would be of value for future CFD validation and hypersonic designs. Temperature-Sensitive Paint is an image-based technology that has been used to acquire measurements of surface temperature and heat flux in wind tunnels. The major limitation to deploying TSP systems in AEDC Tunnel B\/C, where temperatures are between 600 F and 2000 F, is the availability of an appropriate TSP. Recently, ISSI has developed phosphor-based TSP system that can be applied with an air-brush, operated at temperatures over 900 F, and removed with a Teflon spatula and Acetone. The overall objective of the program is to deploy a TSP-based system for acquiring surface temperature, heat flux, and heat transfer measurements in AEDC Tunnel B\/C. The technical maturity and accuracy of the TSP technique has been demonstrated in numerous wind tunnel experiments. The potential to deploy a production data acquisition and processing TSP system is demonstrated by the commercial PSP\/TSP systems that have been installed by the proposing team. It is noted that the market for TSP measurements in high temperature wind tunnels is limited, however, the fundamental technology that is key to the proposal, optical measurements of surface temperature has applications in a variety of markets. It is well known that gas turbine engine manufactures would like to deploy CMCs to both reduce weight and increase efficiency of these engines. Uniform film cooling of the CMC is required to prevent cracks in the CMC. An experimental system that could measure these temperatures on test rigs would be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of film cooling designs. ISSI is a key commercial source of PSP\/TSP technology worldwide, with customers in the US, Japan, Korea, and several countries in the EU. Total sales from this technology are now over $1,000,000 per year with significant growth seen each of the last 6 years. Several commercial customers have expressed interest in a high temperature measurement capability. With our current market position, ISSI will be able to market this new capability to existing customers as well as develop new customers."

The required effective emissivity of 0.9995 and radiance temperature accuracy of 25 mK represent an advancement of nearly 100x over infrared calibration sources of this geometry. If successful, this advancement will revolutionize the state of the art in space qualified IR calibration sources.BENEFIT:This state of the art blackbody will exceed the performance of any other comparable radiant source of equal size, weight and power by a factor of 100. As such it will be of particular benefit as an infrared source in cryogenic vacuum space test chambers and as a space-based calibration source for remote sensors."

The specific goals of our Phase I proposal are to conduct a trade study to evaluate multiple alternatives, and produce a preliminary design of the most desirable alternative. The new Infrared Target Collection System (ITCS) will dramatically decrease the collection times associated with a standard exploitation measurement program, while simultaneously providing full upper hemisphere coverage in target-sensor geometries. Additionally, our design will improve system reliability beyond that of the current system by maximizing the use of state-of-the-art commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components with proven track records of high reliability. Our optimized system design will allow collection of data at a constant slant range from anywhere in the upper hemisphere over a target located at the center of the hemisphere.BENEFIT:At the end of our Phase I effort, SGR develop a preliminary design that will provide a true leap forward in the time required to collect calibrated IR imagery of ground mobile systems in support of the DoD and Intelligence communities. By carrying our preliminary design to the level of detail that we propose, SGR believes that the cost-realism of our Phase II implementation and demonstration effort will be very sound. Beyond the prototype, SGRs approach will support commercialization of the system in three key areas: 1) Identification of additional data collectors who will benefit from a similar system. 2) New DoD application of the system to collect stereo-pair target geometry model data. 3) Non-DoD applications in the sports broadcasting industry (advanced SkyCam)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To address the Air Forces need for improving ground station antenna efficiency, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Ground-based Instrumentation Low-profile Antenna (GILA). This proposed device is based on a new design that utilizes POC experience in developing antennas and custom materials. The innovation in electromagnetic field conditioning will enable the antenna to provide improved efficiency and wider beam width for telemetry in a small form factor. As a result, this technology offers adequate gain, large field-of-regard (FOR) tracking coverage, and wide enough beam widths to allow effective tracking and acquisition of fast moving weaponry, which directly address the Air Force requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of GILA by first evaluating existing telemetry platforms, identifying concepts, and selecting candidate solutions that could be developed to improve antenna efficiency. This analysis will lead to a final demonstration of the optimal design via prototyping to prove feasibility and operational effectiveness. In Phase II, POC will refine the Phase I concept to mature the solution for telemetry applications and conduct system-level testing and evaluation of the prototype for the Air Force Research Laboratory at technology readiness level (TRL)-4\/-5.BENEFIT:POCs GILA will also find use in transmitters and receivers for telecommunications, sensors, and other applications requiring data transfer in different bands and limited real estate, e.g., satellite uplink and downlink antenna systems, and broadband data links for airplanes and for the radar in commercial airliners. The structure of the GILA can easily be applied to antenna transmitters on water towers, buses, trains, and vehicles, for high-bandwidth data transfer. The GILA also has applications in SATCOM on the Move (SOTM) for TV and radio transmission and reception systems."

The system will be designed and implemented to be compatible with the existing UHARS\/SPIDER environment and, as a result, streamline the development process, improve the maintainability, and increase mission effectiveness while maximizing return on investment for the Government. The system will consist of two complimentary modules: a precision Laser-coded Environmental Absolute Positioning (LEAP) module and a passive, Optical Precision-reference Tool Kit (OPTK). These modules are designed to cooperatively observe environmental landmarks to determine highly-accurate position and attitude information. In order to provide the maximum mission flexibility, both modules use a seamless combination of pre-surveyed reference landmarks and landmarks of opportunity.BENEFIT:The sensor-fusion mechanization proposed herein has significant commercialization potential for both military and commercial applications. A non-RF reference system for Air Force Test Center (AFTC) ranges is an example military commercialization direction that we will pursue. Commercialization for other military applications such as navigation of autonomous aerial vehicles (UAV) in GPS-denied environments will be pursued in collaboration with Honeywell whose support letter is included at the end of the proposal. For the private sector, the largest commercialization potential will be realized by applying the positioning technology for automotive safety applications for driving scenarios where GPS and GNSS signals are challenged or denied due to man-made and natural obstacles such as urban canyons and dense tree canopies."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:We propose to develop a 3D tomographic background-orientated Schlieren measurement technique, including hardware setup and post-processing software to produce 3D visualization of compressible flow features in large transonic wind tunnels. Such an approach relies on a novel synthetic self-similar fractal-based background and explores various tomographic reconstruction algorithms that will yield pertinent volumetric information such as the 3D structure of shock waves, vortices, turbulent wakes, boundary layers, etc. Hybrid wave-optics and ray-tracing simulations will be carried out to test and evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the various post-processing tomographic 3D reconstruction algorithms as well as to determine testing hardware\/software requirements. Particular attention will be spent toward enabling the 3D reconstruction and visualization code(s) to run in near real-time to allow for a more immediate feedback during wind tunnel testing.BENEFIT:A near real-time 3D background-orientated Schlieren measurement technique would improve compressible flow feature characterization in transonic wind tunnels. This would greatly increase the understanding of the 3D structure of such flow features in a time frame that would allow for immediate feedback to researchers running the wind tunnel tests. The proposed approach would produce a quantifiable accuracy, as determined through simulation (in Phase I) and tunnel testing (in Phase II), for the post-processing tomographic 3D reconstruction algorithms. Such a measurement capability would find wide-ranging use in aero-dynamic testing environments such as wind tunnels and flight testing where 3D flow visualization is desired, especially for CFD validation. Alternative uses for such measurement technology would be for developing and validating fluid simulations in computer graphics."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The interaction of high Mach flows with the aircraft and engine structures generates complex fluid dynamic phenomena that include shock waves, shear layers, vortices, and separated flows, all of which can be further influenced by the thermochemical behavior of the high-temperature air. These fluid phenomena affect high-speed inlet operability and performance, but are not well understood, nor modeled. As such, inlet development often incorporates parametric testing of active and passive flow control approaches, such as boundary layer bleed. Currently parametric inlet bleed testing suffers from manual implementation of selectively filling or opening holes in plates with large array of holes. Our proposed solution automates the process by introducing a parametric bleed interface that has embedded flow metering and control for each bleed hole. The system replaces the current setup with one that allows remote, automated, real-time variation of bleed pattern and flow variance without any tunnel downtime, and with continuous monitoring of operational performance discretely for each bleed hole to eliminate run time uncertainties. A preliminary design of the miniaturized parametric bleed interface unit will be delivered at the end of the Phase I effort, supported by analysis and risk reduction testing.BENEFIT:Real-time, automated implementation of parametric inlet bleed without tunnel downtime Integrated flow metering and control for each bleed hole enabling flexible bleed pattern and discrete flow variation Faster, less expensive development of high-speed inlet configurations in support of growing market needs Derivative applications to embedded flow control for engine applications"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The overall goal of the project is to develop reliable reduced order modeling technologies to automatically generate parameter-varying aerothermoservoelastic (ATSE) reduced-order models (ROMs) for fast Fluid-Thermal-Structural Interactions (FTSI) assessment and control system design. The Phase I effort will focus on developing several key components, including parameter-varying formulation of hypersonic FTSI, aerothermodynamic ROMs, thermostructural dynamics ROMs, as well as a strategy to integrate these ROMs along with sensor, actuator, and control law for closed-loop control analysis in broader hypersonic flight envelope. A modular software framework will be established for automated data exchange, aerothermodynamic and thermostructural ROM generation, ROM integration, computation, and verification. The feasibility of the proposed technology will be demonstrated for several ATSE test problems of AFRL interest. The Phase II effort will focus on: (1) ROM engine optimization in terms of functionality, execution efficiency, and automated parameter selection; and (2) software environment enhancements with direct interfacing to AFRL-relevant software architecture for closed-loop guidance and control simulation, and fully automated ROM process for facile technology insertion and transition; and (3) extensive software validation and demonstration for ATSE and flight control analysis of complex airframe configuration of current AFRL interest. BENEFIT:The proposed technology will provide a fast and accurate ROM tool for FTSI analysis and closed-loop ATSE simulations of aerospace vehicles and aircrafts. USAF applications of the technology include: (1) comprehensive studies and understanding of FTSI, its trajectory path dependence, and its impact on aeroelastic instability and control system; (2) rapid and computationally affordable assessment (sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, etc.) for optimal aerodynamic, thermal, and structural design of high-speed aerospace vehicles; (3) development of advanced, reliable control strategies (such as controlled flight parameter, surface controls, etc.); and (4) arrangement of test procedures for rational use of instruments and facilities. The success in the proposed research will markedly reduce the development cycles of aerospace vehicles and aircrafts at reduced costs. Among non-DoD applications, the proposed software will find use in various engineering sectors, including NASA, aerospace, automobile, combustion, power, chemical plants, biomedical, among others. The product would directly contribute to these vital areas by enabling accurate, real-time, parametric analysis and prediction capabilities, which can be used in (1) efficient simulation for concept evaluation and optimized design with dramatically shorter turnaround time; (2) on-field system diagnostics and troubleshooting, (3) sensitivity analysis and correlation identification of system parameters; and (4) advanced control strategies for on-line process monitoring and control."

This will be accomplished by combining state-of-the-art model reduction approaches for CFD aerothermodynamics and FEM thermo-structural dynamics of hypersonics with novel real-time simulation capabilities. The goal is a real-time multi-fidelity, multi-physics computational simulation framework that will enable robust and trusted operations and decisions for munitions operating on terminal hypersonic trajectories (e.g. Mach 6-12, 80 kft to sea level).BENEFIT:High-speed weapons represent a game changing technology that are essential for maintaining air &amp; space superiority, and by extension, national security of the U.S. However, successful development of such systems is currently obstructed by a litany of challenges; many of which that stem from: 1) a tight coupling between the aerodynamic, structural, control, and propulsion sub-systems, 2) operation in extremely high energy, combined loading conditions (e.g., fluid, thermal, inertial, and acoustic loads) that drive FTSI, 3) the complexity of maintaining precision in the presence of evolving vehicle properties (caused by FTSI), and 4) the impracticality of conducting ground-based experiments that can tackle these issues.1 As advances are made in FTSI modeling technology a next step is the development of real-time enabled models as real-time simulation is critical for the development of electronic guidance and control systems. Thus, research is needed in order to successfully advance the development of high-speed weapon systems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Electronic safety and arming devices (ESADs) are critical for safe operation of missiles and bombs. These devices use environmental sensors to ensure that warheads are not armed until after the vehicle is launched and has reached a safe flight condition. Existing vehicles use intrusive airspeed sensors (turbines, Pitot tubes) that are not suitable for proposed high-speed missiles due to drag and cooling problems. New, non-intrusive environmental sensors are needed for future vehicles with sustained flight above Mach 3. We propose to develop a non-intrusive sensor that is powered by the flight environment above Mach 3. This sensor will be simple and fail-safe with an extremely low probability of providing false positive signals. It will also be small, lightweight, and easy to integrate on a wide range of hypersonic vehicles.BENEFIT:Our environmental sensors will decrease the drag and cooling requirements on hypersonic cruise missiles compared to existing intrusive sensors. The sensors will also improve missile safety through being self powered and inherently fail-safe. The core technology of our sensor also has significant applications for energy scavenging on hypersonic vehicles, military and commercial aircraft, and ground vehicles."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In response to the Air Force topic AF151-190, Environmental Sensors for High Speed Airframes, the Innoveering team has devised an innovative and compact sensor\/energy harvesting system that will meet DoD requirements, our MEMS Environmental Sensor and Harvesting (MESH) system. Our MESH system will: (i) be able harvest power from the environment being sensed in order to provide power to a portion of the safety critical subsystem; (ii) sense and report the transition from subsonic to hypersonic flight by measuring unique characteristics that are associated with the different high speed airframes of interest; (iii) not impact the high speed airframes performance; (iv) have dedicated circuitry that will support the safety critical subsystem; (iv) have its own dedicated electrical wiring that will not be shared with any other subsystem on the airframe; (v) use discrete components and discrete logic elements to facilitate RAMS requirements and all DoD system requirements (eg Joint Ordnance Test Procedure (JOTP) 052, 053).BENEFIT:Anticipated benefits of the current effort are: (i) providing the DoD with a unique combination sensor\/power harvesting system that increases reliability for providing mission critical data to safety critical subsystems and (ii) pushing the limit of harsh environment sensors that could potentially provide spin-off benefits to power harvesting systems and high temperature thermoelectric materials. Our approach to commercialization for the proposed safety critical sensor system is to form a Strategic Alliance with ATK Missile Products Division. They have agreed to be a subcontractor to our Phase I effort, supporting our initial Phase I by providing expertise and reviewing our design. ATK is already supporting DARPAs Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) and Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) programs, and their Fuzing and Warheads division is very interested in addressing the need for a second environment sensor in regards to these programs. We intent to maintain our working relationship with ATK during the Phase II effort, and will open dialogue with them on how to transition the technology developed under the SBIR effort to a Phase III development and qualification program. As a safety critical system, the market for the solution we are proposing is limited to the DoD. Of what is known at this time, DARPAs HAWC and TBG programs will provide opportunities for testing prototypes that will be developed in the later Phases, perhaps during Phase II, but more importantly, either HAWC or TBG will lead to an AF acquisition program."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Advancements in propulsion systems, aerodynamics, and flight control capabilities are enabling hypersonic vehicles to operate at high speeds and altitudes. Therefore, significant new demands are placed on the materials used for constructing a hypersonic system due to the harsh environment created by the high speeds. An integrated design approach that considers the design, the processing, and the selection of the materials simultaneously with the overall design of the vehicle will link the material properties selection to the overall performance of a hypersonic vehicle and constitute a major new enabling technology. In this project the ICMSE modeling and simulation approaches will be investigated and the material selection will be integrated with the decision support environment which is offered by the DS Toolkit. The DS Toolkit offers the ability to determine how the performance metrics and the operational requirements change when the design of the vehicle varies. The DS Toolkit has been employed in the past for hypersonic vehicle design. The new developments will be employed for conducting the material selection, the trajectory analysis, and the thermal protection system (TPS) design simultaneously for a hypersonic vehicle. Thus, the tight integration of the material selection with the overall design process will be demonstrated.BENEFIT:Integrating material selection with product design is of interest to the shipbuilding, automotive, aircraft, space, military ground vehicle, and energy Industry sectors. The common factors among these Industries are: all use multi-physics simulation models for assessing the performance of their products during design; designing materials for cost effectiveness, ease of manufacturing, and enhanced properties is an essential part in new product development; they all have needs for reducing weight and creating fuel efficient systems; they all have multiple and mutual competing performance requirements. In addition, the energy Industry and any powertrain application have similar needs with hypersonic vehicles for materials that exhibit good mechanical properties at high temperatures. Thus, significant benefits will be offered in many Industries by the technology which will be developed by the proposed project."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This proposal addresses the problem of ground moving target detection and geolocation using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) from a hypersonic air platform. Combining SAR, Along-track Interferometry (ATI) and Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) can often yield accurate target geolocations. In a high speed environment, the pulse repetition frequency(PRF) requirements for SAR and GMTI are different, and the PRF is often limited by the desired range coverage. During the proposed effort, C&amp;P Technologies (C&amp;P) plans to analyze the system parameters selection to meet the operation requirement of the hypersonic air vehicle. In such situations, traditional clutter cancellation techniques that rely on stationarity are not very effective, and a new approach is necessary for detecting and geolocating moving targets in realistic clutter such as high RCS buildings and nonstationary environments. A two tier processing strategy is proposed here with signal processing for clutter minimization and moving target detection followed by exploiting available spatio-temporal priori information for false target elimination. C&amp;P proposes to investigate specific challenges introduced by hypersonic platforms such as clutter Doppler foldover due to high platform velocity, high grazing angle that exposes higher amounts of ground clutter, limited field of view due to high speed and low altitude.BENEFIT:The proposed technologies can offer improvement for commercial sensor developers and system integrators for hypersonic air vehicles in terms of target detection, identification and discrimination. The proposed Phase I efforts will offer the necessary key algorithms\/methods for integration of the proposed algorithms into current high speed airborne radar systems. Military applications of the proposed research include improved detection and identification of moving targets from high speed air vehicles including space based radars. Commercial applications include improved the current radar system performance for border patrol, drug traffic monitoring, perimeter surveillance and air traffic control applications."

        "abstract": "There is a strong movement to add Non-Kinetic Fire COAs, such as Electronic Warfare attack and Computer Network Attack to the military planners toolbox. Because this new approach, called Integrated Fires (IF), integrates attack types from across traditionally separate planning disciplines it requires the creation of new planning methodologies and technologies. One key technology gap is in the Navys ability to identify and evaluate COAs that fit the current battlespace. While recent laboratory studies have shown that is possible to evaluate IF COAs using game theory models these methods have significant limitations in supporting the complexities of an operational battlespace. Soar Tech and KAB Laboratories propose to develop new cloud analytic services for IF COA evaluation. These services use goal-based constraint reasoning to map the complex battlespace into planner defined mission contexts and from there into specific COAs defined as Hidden Markov Models for evaluation. We will accelerate this work by leveraging existing Soar Tech technical components and KAB Laboratories FAST event generator for technical experimentation. This work will contribute new COA analysis services, new HMM evaluation services, and new operator interfaces for defining IF COAs and mission contexts."

The lack of advanced monitoring technologies necessary to perform high fidelity diagnostics and prognosticswithin the constraints of most Navy platforms and logistics infrastructurerepresent a key technology gap that must be bridged to derive the majority of the value and cost saving. In this project, advanced diagnostic and prognostic algorithms will be combined with a mature commercial industrial machine monitoring solution.

        "abstract": "Condition-based maintenance (CBM) has the potential to significantly reduce operating costs through improved equipment management and more informed scheduling of maintenance activities. Sensing hardware can monitor equipment health, apply diagnostic algorithms to evaluate an assets current state, and make projections for how the system will perform if damage is detected and tracked. For maintainers to benefit most from CBM and prognostics (CBM+) techniques, more processes need to be implemented at the sensor node where transient and steady-state operations are monitored. These computational processes themselves must be robust and reliable in identifying the type and extent of damage as it evolves, while also being resource and power efficient for deployment on low-power electronics platforms. Luna proposes to develop methods for processing time, frequency, and modal domain data for hydraulic subsystems that are representative of those on the Virginia class submarine. Physical and data driven statistical models will be used to characterize the systems normal operating state and subsequently used to generate failure estimates based on data from damage scenarios conducted in the laboratory. Algorithms will be written expressly for implementation on low-power microcontrollers, leveraging Lunas extensive experience in the design and fielding of embedded sensor nodes for condition monitoring."

The COBRA target detection algorithms are based on statistical classifiers that are trained using samples from past data collects. A serious issue is the difficulty of estimating system performance in these situations. Arets approach to dealing with this issue is to develop a comprehensive model of the COBRA system with the objective of estimating detection performance for unseen locales and target types. Development of this model will lead to the creation of a software tool for COBRA performance prediction called the COBRA Modeling Tool (COBRA MT). COBRA MT will utilize previous COBRA imagery and associated performance to predict performance in unseen but similar locales. For dissimilar backgrounds in new locales, COBRA MT will automatically generate COBRA synthetic imagery. In those situations the synthetic imagery will be injected into the COBRA algorithms to estimate performance."

To demonstrate feasible cost and performance using this technology, the Navy requires a direct analog-to-digital conversion for the 850-950 MHz band having a noise figure of less than 3.5 dB, supporting 90 1 MHz bands of nonlinear frequency-modulated signals yielding a 1.5 microsecond pulse from a 32 microsecond transmitted pulse. Bedford Signals proposes to meet Navy needs by leveraging our extensive experience in band-pass sampling, digital signal processing, and high performance digital, analog, and RF hardware design.

        "abstract": "Drawing on its experiences with a variety of radar system designs, both as the sole designer and as a team member, Colorado Engineering, Inc. (CEI) with teammate Saab Defense and Security USA LLC, proposes to research the state-of-the-market, model, simulate, and analyze the trade-space of five alternative radar front-end designs, which all utilize band pass filters: Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) utilizing a high-speed Analog to Digital Converter (ADC); the Direct Band Pass Undersampling (DBPU) method described in the solicitation; and three variants of a design based on a conventional local oscillator (LO) down converter. Analyzing these design architectures will cover the most promising architectures using current and near-future devices. The results of the analysis derived from modeling with reference designs, utilizing Matlab and RF modeling tools (AWR VSS and Microwave Office), will be presented to the Navy to determine the best candidate design for use in Naval rotating air surveillance radar systems; including the SPS-49, in order to improve performance and reduce costs during the systems&apos; entire lifecycle."

        "abstract": "A process is proposed for manufacturing low-cost, high-quality, GaN-on-Diamond wafers, so as to enable production of high-power RFICs at costs that substantially outperform their equivalent circuits manufactured on GaN-on-SiC. The process utilizes an epitaxial transfer approach in which gallium nitride is grown epitaxially on silicon carbide handle wafers, removed from the handles, and bonded to diamond wafers. The approach relies on Modern Microsystems proprietary plasma polishing and diamond bonding technologies to ensure that the GaN-Diamond bond interface is smooth, uniform, and strong, with minimal thermal boundary resistance.An epitaxial transfer approach to GaN-on-Diamond allows selection of the best GaN and diamond materials taking into account both cost and performance considerations, resulting in much lower cost per chip. GaN grown on SiC exhibits better electrical performance than GaN grown on Si due to the lower lattice mismatch with the growth substrate. Similarly, epitaxial transfer permits use of the growth face of the diamond substrate at the interface with the GaN. The growth face of diamond has larger grains and fewer defects than the seed face, resulting in higher thermal conductivity in the most-critical near-interface region. The approach results in higher-quality GaN-on-Diamond at much lower cost."

Such an application must provide a comparison process of component attributes through an automated capability while leveraging a digital environment qualification through finite element analysis. Analysis of shock worthiness of new or modified components may then be deduced through a comparison that accounts for ranges of potential differences in component physical attributes, mounting conditions, and orientations. An ontology database and rules provide the perfect match for the needs of component property comparison as they allow for the automatic inference of differences, similarity qualification, and range of differences scoring. The ontology is a database format that captures domain concepts in a hierarchal format while capturing the relationships and similarity between concepts. These will provide a first level of component attribute comparisons. A second finite element analysis of physical differences of high load stresses will be accomplished through both ontology rules and data integration with finite element analysis tools used by the Navy and innovative alternatives such as Progeny?s biometrical facial recognition capability for analyzing differences in graphical plots currently familiar to Navy component designers."

        "abstract": "Component acceptance by a shock Qualification by Extension (QBE) process takes advantage of the similarities between a candidate equipment item and previously qualified components to save cost, while continuing to mitigate risk attributed to high-intensity shock. WAI will develop a software tool which will facilitate the comparison of new (candidate) designs to designs that have been previously tested and successfully shock qualified, thereby making the shock QBE justification process more predictable, repeatable, and inexpensive to execute. The framework for the tool will consist of a guided QBE review process with questions\/answers, and recommended comparative assessments between a candidate item and previously shock tested\/qualified equipment. Candidates of different levels of complexities will be used to verify the framework, demonstrating the frameworks flexibility. One of the key objectives in this development is to identify opportunities to reduce the amount of analysis that is required to develop a high level of engineering confidence in a successful QBE. If analysis must be conducted to increase the probability of a successful QBE, the guided process will recommend which analysis (or series of analyses) will be most effective in demonstrating similarity between the candidate and equipment of similar categories and classifications that has been tested\/shock qualified."

In our personal automobiles, we couple information we glean from our cellular phones, such as electronic maps, internet restaurant reviews and shopping information with information presented to us by our car computer and our direct visual perception of the world  to consider options and make real-time navigation decisions. Likewise, submarine sailors couple data gleaned from Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems with contact information and direct visual perception of the world to make safety-critical navigation decisions. The challenge of ubiquitous data availability, in our personal lives and on submarines, is an operators ability (or inability) to visually integrate multiple disparate data sets into actionable knowledge rapidly and accurately.

The Navy seeks to use submarine periscope image data to automatically acquire and maintain visual fixes on various Navaids, in order to reduce operator workload and enhance the team decision making for navigation. Altron proposes to expand on previous image-based object tracking and image recognition work to develop a system which can automatically find and accurately localize various types of Navaids, and maintain position estimates of each Navaid when not in the imaging system field of view. As Navaids are tracked, image data will be automatically extracted and used to update a cloud-based database of Navaid templates and corresponding locations, to improve future recognition to be shared by the fleet."

Modern submarines are equipped with numerous sensors as part of the Integrated Submarine Imaging System (ISIS), which includes periscope video in the visible (electro-optical, EO) and various infrared (IR) spectra. However, this data is currently not utilized for navigation due to a lack of appropriate tools, yet computer vision and digital image processing technologies are capable of analyzing imagery to identify and track different types of navigation aids. In addition, digital navigation products, such as Digital Nautical Charts (DNCs) and Electronic Navigation Charts (ENCs), are available to provide relevant information about shipping lanes, navigational aids, depth soundings, and underwater hazards. This proposal describes a system that incorporates these different sources of information and provides automated tools to assist navigation and piloting teams. In particular, we will develop computer vision algorithms to provide enhanced capabilities for the automatic detection, tracking, and re-acquisition of visual location fixes. Our approach builds on the Surveillance, Persistent Observation, and Target Recognition (SPOTR) system, a suite of real-time image and video analytics tools successfully deployed with numerous government and commercial customers."

One concept is a new use for existing, commercial, CMOS imagers. SJOS proposes a practical method to add a range-gated imaging mode to existing passive CMOS imagers. The range-gated imagery provides vision through fog, spray, and other obscurants; it also provides long range target identification at night almost equal to day performance. The second concept enhances both the field of view and range judgment through a vehicle-mounted heads up display. Both concepts provide enhanced performance at low cost. We expect that the cost effective solutions for the ACV requirements will be adopted, in part or as a whole, by other military and commercial platforms that face the same challenges."

        "abstract": "Air Cushion Vehicles (ACVs) conduct day and night, off-shore, near-shore, and on-shore missions. Operational and safety navigation requirements dictate that craft operators maintain situational awareness in littoral environments during all conditions. Operators must be able to see through sea spray, high humidity, haze, smoke, and dust. A complete situational awareness solution that is insensitive to ambient lighting and obscurants is required for a navigational aid. Aret proposes the use of a Dual Active and Passive Sensor (DAPS) combined with real-time fusion to provide the LCAC operator with a navigation display insensitive to low-visibility conditions. Currently, available large format cameras offer a wide area surveillance capability at very fine resolution which can be used for persistent surveillance over large areas of interest. The LIDAR sensor offers a complementary capability by providing high-resolution 3D terrain and obstacle data. This data can be used for a wide variety of ways including terrain mapping, object classification, feature detection and obstacle identification. The EO data will be overlaid onto the 3D LIDAR data to form an immersive, real-color, model of the area of interest."

Testing using state of the art electrodes will demonstrate the capacity to increase the energy density of conventional cells while maintaining the lifetime performance. Pouch cell construction will demonstrate the scalability of the proposed technology and lay the ground work for multi-Ah cell builds in Phase II. The option effort will investigate the performance of the cell when using a non-flammable electrolyte. It will be demonstrated that performance is maintained with the non-flammable electrolyte while improving the cell safety. For the optimal system, a plan will be developed for producing the larger cells necessary for the Phase II prototype demonstration. The Phase II prototype cell construction and testing efforts will highlight the ability to form safe, high energy cells with the developed technology."

        "abstract": "Performance improvements and cost reduction efforts are perpetually underway to shipboard wireless technology device batteries to meet and exceed the safety, energy and lifecycle targets set forth by the Navy. All-solid-state batteries are being investigated to meet these target metrics as they offer ultimate safety, higher packing efficiency, and longer cycle life of high voltage batteries over state-of-the-art liquid-based batteries. However, all-solid-state batteries have not been widely commercialized on account of low performance resulting from low ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte (SE), and insufficient cycle life resulting from surface reactions between SE and electrode materials. Surface coatings on battery powders can prevent material dissolution and enable the full potential for all-solid-state batteries including absolute safety under extreme conditions, shelf life and cycle life beyond the life of the instrument they power, high energy density as a result of enabled higher packing efficiency of all-solid-state batteries, and lower cost resulting from improved manufacturing capability. This SBIR Phase I project will focus on applying surface stabilizing coatings to high-impact battery materials for the purpose of creating a complete, high performance all-solid-state battery with a scalable roadmap using existing manufacturing capabilities."

In Phase I, we will demonstrate a solid-state battery by employing high capacity electrodes and inorganic solid electrolyte. The battery utilizes existing high capacity electrodes developed by CFDRC and high conductive solid electrolytes. We will focus on evaluating both feasibility of the concept and operational capacity of the device by i) synthesizing the solid electrolyte, ii) fabricating the high capacity electrodes, iii) assembling the cell and electrochemical testing of the battery, and iv) computational modeling to predict the charge and discharge characteristics. The solid state battery will be a safe, reliable solution providing sufficient energy for the Navy applications."

Three major aspects of each change request are to be assessed separately, 1) complexity, 2) operational impact, and 3) mission impact. Each of these will be assessed using three complementary quantitative models: linear, neural, and case-based reasoning. The resulting nine models will be trained using a relational database representation of past change requests, created using text mining. The approach under study uses an optimized ensemble learning function combining linear and quantile information into separate aggregate ratings for complexity, operational impact, and mission impact before aggregating those three aspects into an overall numeric assessment for priority. Each assessment will have a machine-generated explanation and a quantitative certainty measure."

The approach utilizes state-of-the-art knowledge engineering to elicit expert tacit rules from past CRs. To replicate current processes, we will build and train models which replicate each product area&apos;s reasoning. This has several benefits. First, it emulates current human based processes (product areas often disagree). Second, it allows a product area expert to easily compare their reasoning with the model&apos;s thus aiding validation. Since subjectivity often creeps into the current CR process, we will augment model behavior by providing tools which automatically 1) &quot;understand&quot; Aegis CSS&apos;s static and dynamic characteristics and 2) use natural language processing to analyze Aegis documentation, test procedures, etc... This provides objectivity heretofore unavailable. We will also develop a model which consolidates all product areas&apos; reasoning (again, mirroring current processes). Each step of our tool will be able to explain why a decision was made, thus allowing experts to understand the underpinnings of the process. Finally, we will apply sophisticated processing to not only prioritize CRs, but also take into account the incremental impacts of &quot;similar&quot; CRs. This allows more CRs to be included in a build than are currently possible."

        "abstract": "The opportunity of interest is the introduction and application of a bistatic tool set for both surface and submarine Mid-Frequency (MF) active sonar systems to enhance anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability in strike group or coordinated surface and submarine ASW operations. The ability to localize threat submarine forces in a battlefield scenario by judicious application of bistatic capability in both surface ship and submarine sonar systems provides important performance benefits to the ASW kill chain. Such leveraging provides a significantly increased ASW capability beyond simple additive value. Achieving these capabilities requires a clear understanding of the information exchange hurdles that must be undertaken at each stage of the process from design and implementation of the underlying search concept to critical bistatic timing, orientation and localization information. An algorithmic approach to a parametric evaluation of these critical parameters will be developed. A principle evaluation metric of the algorithm will be the resultant bistatic detection Area of Uncertainty (AOU), a value to be determined at each step of the parametric approach. As bistatic capabilities are developed and implemented, the capability can be efficiently and rapidly transitioned among ASW sonar systems via the common processing development of the AxB process."

        "abstract": "Metron and Adaptive Methods propose to design a sonar bistatic active processing concept to exploit off-board active transmissions for improved target prosecution. A fundamental challenge with bistatic operation is high fidelity estimation of the source kinematic state and transmission state parameters. A critical goal of our proposed effort is a methodical mapping of source state estimate and its uncertainty through the signal and information processing chain and its impact on target detection, tracking and localization. Analytical and simulated data will be used to support the Phase I study and to assess the impact for differing multi-ship geometries and environments. The error budget to system performance mapping product will impose practical constraints in the development of our Phase I concept. We propose to design, develop and demonstrate enabling source localization and source tracking algorithms for practical multistatic tracking in a staged approach to achieve these objectives: (1) conduct a sensitivity analysis of the effects that source localization errors have on target tracking, (2) develop a system architecture and technical approach to achieve source state estimation performance to fully exploit bi-static operations, and (3) develop innovative algorithms and demonstrate proof of concept capability using simulated data."

The system does not need to install any instruments on SSBN, and works in all weather conditions and up to sea state 4. There are two combinations of camera and laser ranger (the camera is in charge of target detection, tracking and angle estimation, and the laser ranger is in charge of ranging) installed on block vehicles nose and tail parts separately taking care of very close range measurement in all weather conditions, and there is one TDMA RF MIMO SAR installed on block vehicles nose part taking care of measurements from far to close range in all weather conditions. A novel range gated receiver structure is designed to cover the long range and at the same time maintain a narrow receiver band. Both of the two categories of sensors have the capability of imaging, target detection, tracking, and angle and range estimation. In the design, we applied state-of-art modeling and algorithm, such as TDMA MIMO SAR and image target detection and tracking, and COTS parts, etc. to minimize the project risk and at the same time maintaining a low cost."

        "abstract": "When escorting a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), blocking vessels automatically maintain their relative position using dynamic positioning (DP) systems, which rely on scanning lasers to precisely measure the positions of targets mounted on the SSBN. To install the targets, SSBN crewmen must risk going on deck while underway on the surface. Laser sensors have other shortcomings: their performance is degraded by rain, snow, fog, smoke, or excessive vessel motion in rough seas; and they can lose track when the sun or bright lights are behind the target. Charles River Analytics proposes to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a Sensor system for Precise Automatic Relative-position Keeping (SPARK) that (1) will use novel short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) and covert radiofrequency (RF) sensors to precisely track SSBNs under all plausible environmental conditions, (2) does not require sailors to go on the SSBNs deck when underway, (3) helps safeguard operational security, and (4) meets regulatory standards for system redundancy by incorporating independent systems based on two different physical principles. If allowed to permanently mount three tiny covert RF transmitters on portable equipment normally placed on the bridge when surfaced, SPARK will provide two backup methods of precision location based on two additional physical principles."

Specially, they are interested in understanding mission planning and Warfighting outcomes impacted by Computer Network Attack (CNA), Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), and active\/passive Electronic Attack (EA). This project will develop C-ISRT for Anti-Access \/ Area Denial (C-A2\/AD) which will design and implement proof-of-concept C-A2\/AD services that address current shortfalls with real-time modeling and analytics by making use of cloud computing resources for hosting the analytics algorithms. Providing such real-time analytics will allow planners to understand integrated fires effects as they are used to coordinate and synchronize the use of kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities across all mission and target sets in all domains. The C-A2\/AD proof-of-concept will be demonstrated during the Phase I project through the use of an A2\/AD scenario. This demonstration will illustrate the C-A2AD approach for assessing effectiveness in self-cueing, coordination, communication, deception, anti-jam and threat locating amidst CNA, CNE, and EA impacted environments."

The system will protect against spatial RFI by using a metamaterial surface to reduce the beamwidth of the radiation pattern. The antenna systems will be designed as an array of supercells consisting of the radiating element and the metamaterial reflector. Cells would be configured using a butler matrix and create a focused beam which would further reduce spatial RFI. The proposed technology will provides a Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) advantage over SATCOM antenna systems currently deployed in CUBESATs. The applications for this technology are focused for CUBESATs and satellite-based communication systems."

        "abstract": "Increasing global RF electromagnetic (EM) activity related to commercial, scientific, and military systems, threatens the integrity of satellite communication links and has resulted in an environment cluttered with RF signals, particularly in the UHF-band. This is causing two major problems: 1) interference (due to co-site and jamming); and 2) increase in the EM noise floor. These effects can cause loss of information, reduce effective data transmission rate, and compromise system operability.Metamagnetics proposes the development of analog, low-cost, passive component solutions based on the unique non-linear properties of ferrite materials to address incoming interference threats and promote low-background-noise transmission of outgoing signals. Incoming signals will be safely received using a UHF-band frequency-selective limiter (FSL) and signal-to-noise enhancer (SNE). These combined technologies provide selective attenuation of co-site interference and jamming threats (via FSL), in addition to reducing the background EM noise floor (via SNE), while simultaneously allowing for friendly signals to pass unaffected. Outgoing signals will pass through a UHF-band SNE, before transmission, to purify the signal by attenuating unwanted spectral content.The proposed technology meets urgent Navy needs for mitigation of co-site interference and jamming threats, and addresses the rising background EM noise level, on increasingly-electromagnetically-cluttered satellite communication links."

        "abstract": "Selecting appropriate clothing systems is essential for the optimal performance of American Warfighters. However, no current assessment system quantitatively assesses and compares the thermal characteristics of clothing systems. Instead, scientists must manually assess the relative performance of different options using thermal cameras and software designed to detect hot and cold spots in static, fixed scenes, like architecture. This manual process is slow, labor-intensive, and prone to ambiguities.We propose a Skeletal Alignment System for QUantitative Analysis of Thermal Clothing Hotspots (SASQUATCH). SASQUATCH is a software system that estimates the poses of human subjects in thermal imagery and computes and compares metrics about the thermal characteristics of their clothing, both overall and for specific body parts. The graphical user interface enables users to explore results in detail by focusing on particular body parts and specifying comparisons between different clothing systems. SASQUATCH is based on our state-of-the-art pose estimation and gesture understanding software, which detects and tracks humans in IR imagery and identifies individual body parts regardless of pose. This robust framework enables real-time analysis of clothing during natural movements and postures, beyond what can be seen in static poses, using a single thermal camera and standard computing hardware."

Intelligent Automatic proposes to develop a Thermal Image Comparison Software Tool that provides quantitative and objective thermal measurement for clothing and PPE assessment. Our solution uses a 3D imaging sensor to estimate motion, determine body pose and locate body parts. A thermal camera aligned with the 3D sensor measures temperature. By mapping temperature to specific body points, thermal measurements from multiple test runs can be mapped to a common 3D wire-frame human model so that thermal stress on specific garment areas or landmarks (seams, sleeve, zippers, etc.) can be compared directly. With this method, the tool can be used while the human subject is moving under a variety of environmental and operating condition. These measurements can be accurately aggregated over time, so they are less sensitive to noise compared to single-frame analysis. Further, the dynamic change of the temperature on different body component could also be recorded."

With decline of the cost on 3D printers and expansion of the material selection, new application areas of this unique technology have been emerging. One of these emerging areas is 3D printing of textiles. Designing clothing items is a multistep process that is time consuming, invasive and often inaccurate. Manufacturing of the garments using 3D printing can significantly reduce number of production steps, provide fit to size clothing, and enable seamless apparels. However, development of polymeric materials that can be processed by 3D Printing and satisfy physical performance of the current textiles is necessary. Lynntech propose to design new nylon-based polymer formulations specifically to use as a feedstock material for 3D printing of textiles. In addition, smart printing patters will be created to enable flexibility and comfort. Our materials will be processed by Fused Filament Fabrication and resulting clothing will fulfil the requirements for physical performance and comfort properties."

The purpose of this SBIR is to develop a software tool to quantitatively and automatically compare infrared images to evaluate the heat and cold stress of clothing. This Quantitative Image Comparison System (QICS) will calculate the overall performance of clothing such that the Navy can empirically discern the clothings performance. The system will automatically determine the presence of a test subject (either human or manikin) that is moving or stationary, capture an IR signature of the clothing, calculate metrics of the clothing articles together and individually, generate a report with the metrics and analysis, and display the analysis and metrics in a live streaming mode. All software developed will run on Windows 7 and utilize COTS camera equipment, either the Navys existing FLIR ThermaCamTM SC640 or equipment provided. A successful system will greatly improve the Navys ability to provide correct recommendations of the performance of various articles of clothing. During Phase I, McQ will design and deliver a functional prototype system which can be used to capture and quantify images of clothing articles such that the Navy can begin building a database of clothing metrics."

Specifically, the innovation in use of p-SiAlCN ceramics and SMI will enable the SOS to survive UHT environments for nonintrusive measurements. The probe will incorporate a replaceable sapphire window, protecting it from oil or debris contamination while withstanding UHTs and high pressures. As a result, this sensor offers high-temperature operation &gt;2500 deg F. The probe will be "

        "abstract": "The ability to monitor the structural health of the rotating components, especially in the hot sections of turbine engines, is of major interest to the aero community in improving engine safety and reliability. This is also true for the Department of Defense (DoD) where current developmental and future engines will need to operate at high efficiencies to meet the mission-weighted fuel burn (MWFB) requirements. This means that engines operate with tighter running clearances, increased blade loading, at substantially higher temperatures. Current blade health monitoring sensors are capable of operating at 1100F continuously uncooled, and have been demonstrated to work up to 1800F with cooling. However, the use of active cooling brings forth undersired effects, and hence, a need exists to develop uncooled sensors that can operate in a +2500F environment in the aft end of the turbo machinery. The Innoveering team is proposing an innovative, low cost, low weight, compact, rugged, in-situ engine sensor system that can operate uncooled at temperatures in excess of 2500F."

In the first step, a list of standardized flight regimes will be developed as this is a pre-requisite for automated verification and validation process, and these may become the recommended standard in the helicopter and HUMS community. In the next step, a helicopter dynamic model will be developed and used to fly various helicopter flight regimes. The parameters of the flight dynamic model will be determined by a nonlinear system identification process utilizing actual HUMS flight data. For all the regimes identified in the first step, appropriate feedback laws will be created to generate the control input time history sequence, which in turn will be given as input to the helicopter dynamic model. The output response from the helicopter model will be fed to the regime recognition codes as simulated HUMS flight data and the predicted regimes will be compared with the known regimes. In the final step, a verification and validation tool will be developed that will compare the regimes predicted by the regime recognition codes with the actual regimes flown by the simulated helicopter model and will output the misclassification rate, confusion matrix and other relevant statistical measures to quantify the accuracy of the regime recognition algorithms. For the purposes of this program, TDA will use the SH-60B helicopter to generate example results and will extend to other helicopter platforms later."

        "abstract": "Fast Reconfiguring Environment for Electronic Kneeboard (Freeboard) is a novel software solution providing independent application environments (personas) for separate security domains while allowing fast transition between personas, efficient collection and reallocation of memory and persistent storage according to need and priority, and secure management of communication media by smart algorithms directing tablet communication according to application and end-point criteria and data type. Each Freeboard persona is an independent operating system environment. Freeboard allows the kneeboard operator to select a persona to run in the foreground and virtualizes tablet hardware access to ensure it can allocate memory and persistent storage according to its own analysis of competing needs and priorities based on history and configuration. Freeboard ensures resources are sanitized before being reallocated between personas, and encryption protects all communication and persistent storage. Freeboard manages communication to ensure an unclassified persona communicates only with unclassified endpoints or with secure gateways. Applications in the classified persona are restricted to the classified network. Freeboard dynamically classifies data to facilitate routing traffic according to latency and bandwidth needs and media availability, optionally with the aid of a persona OS located component that labels outgoing traffic according to application source and data type."

Group 2-3 UAS, due to their small size, slow cruise speeds and climb rates; exacerbate the probability of their involvement in a Mid Air Collision (MAC). Therefore, there exists a need for a SAA solution that will enable small UAS to avoid MAC while satisfying their Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints. In past work, UtopiaCompression Corporation (UC) has demonstrated the components of a passive sensor based SAA solution using both simulated and flight test data. The objective of this effort is to prove the concept of an optical SAA system and the feasibility of meeting the SWaP limitations of small UAS."

A novel radar structure is applied to make the system having enough working range and at the same time having high enough range and angle estimation accuracy. The smart antenna technique is applied, so one transmit can be used to search all interested angles with a gated range. The software defined radio (SDR) concept is applied to make the system having the plug and play capability. The system integrates a mixture of state-of-the-art modeling and algorithms, such as range gated chirp radar receiver, and a lot of mature techniques, such as smart antenna angle estimation, Fast Fourier transform (FFT) for target detection, Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts, etc. This combination of the state-of-the-art techniques and mature techniques\/devices greatly reduces the system implementation risk."

SARA has over 15 years of experience designing acoustic sense and avoid systems for UAS. Our hardware has been extensively flight tested on Group 1 and 2 UAS in relevant environments. These systems can detect intruding aircraft from sufficient ranges and provide suggested maneuvers to UAS pilots with adequate warning time. We have recently identified a novel set of algorithms which allow us to not only detect aircraft but also to track their position using our existing UAS mounted microphone array. The tracking capability provided allows for more advanced collision prediction and enables advanced definitions of well clear. We plan to rapidly mature our new tracking algorithms, quickly bringing PANAMA to a high TRL in the Phase I and II SBIR programs. PANAMA is an all-weather system, which outperforms electro-optic solutions, and is superior to radar in size, weight, power and cost. PANAMA will enable Navy UAS operations, and strengthen the safety case for UAS operation in the national airspace system."

The codes will be used to simulate the rotorcraft and provide ?truth data? that can be compared to the predictions from RR codes. Combined with the team?s expertise in design of experiments, applied to both testing as well as aircraft design; the proposed approach seeks to fill in the Navy?s need for a stand-alone tool to validate proprietary rotorcraft regime recognition codes.

        "abstract": "Unmanned Autonomous Systems are required to operate in cluttered, unknown, and unstructured environments. Guaranteeing the safety of these systems is critical for their successful deployment. Autonomous vehicles often need to operate near their limits to effectively complete their tasks. Safety of these vehicles needs to be imposed while respecting the constraints imposed by sensory and dynamic limitations of the vehicle. Current state-of-the-art certification approaches for evaluating the route planners in the presence of uncertainty typically involve large Monte Carlo simulations, and the use of subject matter experts to tailor the scope of unbounded testing (in order to fit into a given computing footprint or project timeline). We propose to develop Safety ALgorithm Test System (SALTS) that verifies safety and evaluates the robustness of in-flight algorithms (e.g. learning-based trajectory generation algorithms) in the presence of uncertainty without the need of exhaustive testing. The notion of MTL robustness is a valuable tool for testing and certification since it allows us to convert a decision problem into an optimization problem. In other words, an optimization algorithm can now be utilized in order to search for system trajectories that minimize the robustness of the system instead of exhaustive and time consuming Monte Carlo simulations."

        "abstract": "The robustness and operational flexibility of UAS will be significantly enhanced through the integration of autonomous path-planning algorithms that modify system behavior based on changing mission requirements and environmental factors. Many such algorithms have been developed, but the certification of these algorithms typically involves brute-force testing in high-fidelity simulation, which is a significant challenge that impedes widespread adoption in operational UAS. The overall goal of the Phase I research effort is to develop a methodology for certification of autonomous path-planning algorithms for UAS that significantly reduces the computational burden relative to brute-force testing. The proposed approach is based on the application of advanced analysis methods to computationally optimized simulation models to gain insight into combinations of inputs and test parameters that may lead to undesirable behavior of the system being evaluated. These results are used to intelligently guide simulation-based testing that uses the full high-fidelity simulation. The team will show the applicability of the test methodology to two different classes of planning algorithm: a deterministic heuristic search-based algorithm and a non-deterministic random sample-based algorithm. The results will be used to show that analysts can draw similar conclusions about the airworthiness of a planning algorithm as an exhaustive brute-force test."

        "abstract": "Near Earth Autonomy proposes to develop and prove the feasibility of new test and certification techniques for autonomous unmanned aerial systems (UAS) guidance and navigation algorithms. The adoption of autonomous UAS that can plan their own trajectories based on real-time sensor data while executing a complex mission, has been slow because the algorithms have not been shown to have sufficient performance or airworthiness. Advanced guidance and navigation algorithms that consider vehicle dynamics are challenging to certify because they can generate a very large number of possible plans to avoid collisions, and land on ships or at unprepared sites. We propose a general methodology that can be used to ensure correct behavior of a large class of unmanned aircraft. The key proposed innovations are a certifiable and testable architecture; a test case generation and benchmark approach; and a formal certification approach for the safety critical components that maximizes coverage with minimum effort. During Phase I Near Earth will design an architecture and tool-chain for testing and certification of guidance and navigation algorithms that is agnostic to the specific algorithmic implementation. The approach will be evaluated in case studies for ship-to-ship flight and cargo delivery missions."

Neutron diffraction techniques have a proven ability to determine residual stresses at significant depths, however implementation of these techniques has been limited to specialized facilities such as the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) neutron at Oak Ridge National Lab. Advances in laboratory based neutron generators have now created the possibility to implement some of these techniques in laboratory and\/or production environments. We plan to exploit the improved capabilities of these generators to realize a practical method that will enable determination of residual stresses throughout large components or bulk materials. The proposed non-destructive evaluation method will combine advantages of conventional in-situ neutron diffraction with energy selective neutron imaging to reveal microstructural information related to the lattice spacing such as phase, texture, and strain. The Phase I program will demonstrate feasibility of our novel method whereas the Phase II program will logically extend Phase I research to implement a practical system. To successfully develop this challenging but highly rewarding technology, we have formed a strong consortium that includes a world renowned expert in experimental measurements of residual stress using neutron and x-ray techniques and an OEM for turbo-machinery, which will effectively address current needs of the Navy."

Tensile RS, however, can cause unfavorable conditions which may lead to premature failure during operational usage. Thus, the industry objective is to capitalize on compressive RS and prevent or minimize tensile RS at critical locations of engine components but this requires a new NDE\/I capability. The Proto Team intends to exploit high energy x-ray diffraction (HEXRD) technologies and demonstrate feasibility for measuring RS distributions non-destructively at subsurface depths in a high-strength aerospace material. Initial experimentation will be performed on laser-peened titanium as the basis for establishing feasibility. The related challenge in this effort is to define and design a small transportable system that can be installed in a factory or depot setting while retaining the depth and resolution performance of the much larger research systems. The Proto Team will capitalize on the experimental research of Iowa State University into HEXRD for measuring subsurface RS and Proto?s expertise in developing, fielding and delivering low-energy, highly portable XRD systems. The Metal Improvement Company will provide Ti-alloy LSP specimens and modelling support."

The model will have the capability to control not just the E-beam free form fabrication (EBF3) process but also the Plasma Transfer Arc wire feed system which MER currently uses, to allow either platform to be used for making initial defect containing samples. Defects due to lack of fusion (LOF) and those due to hot cracking will be targeted by the initial study. A unified model of hot cracking will be developed including solidification range of the alloys and superimposed thermal residual stress field. In phase I samples made with known defects on the PTA platform will be compared with similar defects in NASA samples made by EBF3 to confirm the physical basis of the ICMSE control model."

        "abstract": "The U.S. Army PEO Ammunition has the mission to develop and procure leap-ahead munitions, improvised explosive device (IED)-defeat products and towed artillery systems to increase combat power to service members. The Army is constantly striving towards improved weapon effectiveness with minimum collateral damage, with constraints on costs. Embedded canard actuation systems are one of the most costly components in spinning projectiles and there is a need to design new actuation mechanisms that are scalable across multiple caliber systems as well as applicable to new projectile designs. The design of such systems requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach coupling aerodynamics, structures, dynamics and controls. To address this need, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes to develop a canard actuation system design tool. The approach leverages on multidisciplinary multifidelity optimization using state of the art analyses. This tool will enable an in-depth physical understanding of designs as well an ability to design systems that are easily scalable, lightweight, inexpensive and satisfy the multiple objectives associated with this problem. Our experience in aircraft design, controls, multidisciplinary analyses and hardware prototyping of actuation systems will enable us to make rapid progress in Phase I."

        "abstract": "Modern tactical environments exhibit a wide array of distributed cognition challenges, particularly with the proliferation of device types available to commanders and soldiers. The transition between desktop and handheld device profiles presents a difficult choice for application design, between costly custom development per-platform or scaling technologies that dont adequately address contextual and workflow changes. Commonly-used approaches such as responsive design are typically focused on ensuring content is formatted correctly across device types, without considering the fundamental changes in how users interact with these devices at varying scales. To solve these problems, a human-centered design approach is needed which ensures that a scalable user interface technology accounts for human cognitive limits such as working memory and attention, in addition to the details of a particular device class such as the information capacity of the display and the interactive elements available (mouse, touchscreen, etc.). The proposed Phase I research includes an assessment of the low-level controlling factors for human-computer interaction at varying scales, along with a survey of current technologies for cost-effective interface scaling. These inputs will be used to produce a unified design framework for scalable user experiences that enables applications to provide the most appropriate interface for the users context."

The Torch Team will define metrics and an analysis processes which aim to match simulation fidelity require-ments with sensor and signal processing capabilities. Furthermore, a set of metrics will be devel-oped to support comparative analysis of synthetic scenes with respect to collected data. Simulation environments are increasingly used to conduct exhaustive testing of advanced autonomous seeker systems. The development and implementation of our fidelity metrics will reduce the associated costs of development of over-specified scenario-specific simulations. Furthermore, by characteriz-ing the required simulation fidelity of autonomous seeker systems, we will enable appropriate con-figuration of scene generation application features and fidelity, which will significantly reduce set-up and runtime costs of large-scale simulation tests. Using our considerable experience with scene generation applications and our comprehensive knowledge of sensor systems, our Phase I work plan will focus on analyzing sensor and signal processing capabilities and assessing simulation fi-delity requirements. Our approach will address the feasibility of the measurement concepts and highlight the advantages of the proposed metric scheme."

The geolocation sensors provide a new tool to help ensure the site is fully searched in a time-effective manner. Data is stored on an Android smart phone and displayed using the Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK) app. KRSE also includes a spectrometer that can identify some materials of interest. Even if the sensor cannot tell a user what the material is, the sensor can tell a soldier where the best spot to collect the sample is. When a soldier wants to collect a sample, he will retrieve the appropriate sampling package, which has a QR code attached to it. After collecting the sample, the QR code is scanned by the Android device, and metadata like position, time, pictures, video, etc, is linked inside of a database. During off-site analysis of the sample, the QR code can be scanned once more, where the metadata will be shown to analysts."

Current commercially available power capacitors, however, suffers from low energy density, low voltage rating, poor stability in a wide temperature range, and high costs. This SBIR project will be devoted into the development of a novel class of high energy density, high voltage MLCCs based on an innovatively designed nanocomposite dielectric material. In addition, the proposed dielectric and capacitors can be processed through scalable and cost-effective methods that exhibit good compatibility with the existing industry technologies, thereby providing for an attractive scalability and potentially low costs suitable for mass productions. In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed technology will be demonstrated through material design, processing, MLCC prototyping, and characterization. In Phase II, both material design and processing will be further optimized. Based on the results, process scaling-up will be carried out, and MLCCs with the targeted properties will be prototyped. Promising performance of the developed MLCC will be demonstrated through more extensive tests with a focus on high energy density, high voltage rating, enhanced temperature stability, and reduced costs."

There continues to be a demand for a robust, simple, unified deployable diagnostic assay sampling kit capable of functioning across multiple environments and sample types while providing data equivalent to lab-based analytical systems. By conducting an aggressive review and evaluation of the knowledge base and marketplace we will provide a foundational knowledge base upon which an updated, unified recon sampling kit can be built. The knowledge gained and evaluated, within the context of mission requirements, will lead to and support enhanced sample collection and preservation; electronic sample tagging, tracking, and chain of custody; a unified technology format for the presumptive identification of CBRNE agents; and a rigorous quality assurance\/training program."

Conventional methods to alleviate this degradation include installing passive vibration-damping materials or adding additional material to shift resonance frequencies. Both of these approaches add parasitic weight to the system. With recent advances in additive manufacturing technologies, components and structures that can benefit from cellular design and optimization are now being realized. Materials Sciences Corporation (MSC) will team with the University of Pittsburgh (PITT) to develop analysis tools for determining cellular architectures, frequency based topology optimization codes that make use of cellular architectures, and design tools to develop cellular structures. The overall objective of the Phase I effort will be to demonstrate the proposed cellular optimization procedure via analysis and validate by experiment."

        "abstract": "Physics-based target and background simulations are used extensively by the missile development community for seeker development and testing. Signature Research, Inc. (SGR) proposes to improve the spatial fidelity of the background by adding an important class of clutter objects, features that have near vertical discontinuities in the terrain topography. These features include washes, dry creeks, gulches, berms, arroyos, and road shoulders. This clutter class is important because these features are at or near ground vehicle sizes and solar heat differentially. SGR will use hydraulic erosion algorithms to notionally restore terrain features that are smoothed by the inherent spatial resolution of the topographic height fields. The physics-based erosion algorithms utilize the height field gradients, soil properties, and water volume. In the proposed semi-automatic software application the user controls the erosion parameters to approximate these features. SGR also proposes to develop the tools to automatically apply a variable thickness soil layer two-dimensional thermal mesh to the height field containing discontinuous features with integration to the one-dimensional soil models and develop a specialized thermal solver compatible with the mesh. The resulting soil node physical temperatures and height field will facilitate accurate rendering with either raster or ray-trace methods to form images."

        "abstract": "Department of Defense Instruction 4650.08 requires that U.S. forces employ navigation warfare (NAVWAR) compliant sources for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). A high level (Level 3) of PNT integrity can be obtained from self-contained sources, such as inertial sensors. As stand-alone tactical-grade inertial sensors are sufficient for only short missions, instruments that are navigation-grade or better are required. Existing navigation-grade sensors are too large, cost too much, and use too much power. Although micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) have shown a great deal of promise in reducing the cost, size, weight, and power (C-SWAP) of inertial sensors, further improvements are required in order to achieve true navigation-grade performance. While there has been a great deal of research conducted on MEMS-based gyrocompass technology, very little has been done to develop front-end micro-electronics for such devices. During this effort Toyon will study the front-end requirements for capacitive- and piezoelectric-based sense and drive electronic front-ends for navigation-grade Coriolis vibratory gyroscopes (CVG) and derive a prototype design for such a system. The prototype design will be constructed and validated during the first half of the Phase II effort before being converted into an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) in the second half of the program."

Its immediate advantages are: no need for struts to support microphones, good discrimination against wind tunnel reverberation, no microphone wind\/flow noise to degrade sensor SNR nor cause downstream turbulence to interfere with the item under test. The technique is based on exploiting natural particles in the air. By remotely measuring the motion of the particles the laser measures the acoustic field radiated by the test article. In effect, the laser creates a virtual microphone positioned at the location of the laser probe volume, and being massless, there is no wind\/flow noise. Multiple probe volumes can be arranged along the laser beam to create a one-dimensional acoustic array. Multiple laser beams can be used to create a two-dimensional array. The laser beam(s) can be steered to gather data at most angles of interest with respect to the test article."

        "abstract": "The wireless projection of power to a remote location has been a recognized DoD need for decades, particularly in UAV applications. To meet this need Optonicus proposes the development of an Optical Power Transmission system with Adaptive Beam Shaping (OPT_ABS) . The proposed OPT_ABS system uses transmitted laser power that is generated in a gimbal-mounted adaptive fiber-array laser system composed of array of densely packed adaptive fiber-collimators. The OPT_ABS laser head with sensors and imaging and tracking telescopes is mounted on the roof of a truck for mobile operations. The laser beam aimpointing, aimpoint stabilization and wavefront phase shaping is achieved via optimization of the laser light power scattered off an array of small retro-reflectors attached to the photovoltaic module on the target platform. The new adaptive beam shaping capabilities enable the OPT_ABS system to operate in continuously changing conditions of turbulence, distance and orientation of the target."

The key to achieving this end-goal is an integrated and experienced team consisting of hardware platforms experts, imaging specialists and system-level designers. Working together, this team can simultaneously develop and integrate the image processing algorithms for turbulence mitigation, build the necessary hardware platforms, and optimize the system further for better serving military needs.

Mapping, searching, and other warfighter missions will strongly rely on the capability of the swarm to accurately localize. Phase I will therefore be focused on demonstrating the localization accuracy of the LOCUST swarm. The same challenges that make these autonomous missions difficult also make the mission very dangerous for warfighters. Therefore, an automated mechanism for clearing these facilities will provide significant assistance to warfighters, especially those on particularly dangerous missions. Robotic Research will utilize achievable vehicle technology and available sensing technology to create a capability that brings the idea of Prometheus balls closer to reality. The proposed mechanism is biologically inspired, and it leans towards lower cost, and speed. Robotic Research has already developed much of the background technology necessary for the proposed approach."

        "abstract": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims to study and demonstrate the feasibility of Compressive Sensing Bio-inspired Visual System (COSBIS), using 0.18um CMOS technology, based on 1.2Kx1.2Kgray scale active pixel sensor array, low power programmable 8-bit hybrid Memory Digital Analog Converter (MDAC) array for compressive projection matrix, bio-inspired target features modeled from extended visual pathways on compressive sensing space and adaptation mechanism, to effectively provide warfighter needs in challenging multiple-threats and multiple-missions environments. COSBIS will enable multiple functions including person\/object\/vehicle (POV) tracking, wide area search, target detection\/classification\/recognition and homemade explosive (HME)\/improvised explosive device (IED)\/POV\/Activity detection, to yield ultra-low size, weight, and power (SWaP) persistent\/multi-functional ISR systems. The objective of this proposal is to study the architecture and develop the simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of COSBIS for hardware implementation. Anticipated technical results include demonstration of COSBIS to successfully perform significantly different tasks of full\/partial, noisy and low-resolution target object for detection, recognition, identification and tracking under hardware configuration and constraints e.g., limited bit quantization of MDAC."

        "abstract": "Espira has developed a Biohazard Analyzer (BA) for rapid pathogen detection. Espiras Biohazard Analyzer goes beyond lab culturing of indicator coliforms and E.coli by detecting a suite of specific bacteria, protozoa and viruses in the same test. Total organisms and viable organisms are separately reported for each pathogen. A typical Biohazard Analyzer test cycle is under 1 hour. This includes automated sample collection, concentration, and detection and can be operated by minimally trained personnel. For this proposal we are applying our BA towards monitoring of E. Coli O157:H7 (bacterial target), Cryptosporidium (parasite target) and Norovirus (viral target). The current approaches to monitor these pathogens are laborious and time consuming. None of the devices is multiplexed enough to accommodate such large variety of pathogens as requested in the solicitation. Typically, more than 24 hours are required with relatively large lab requirements and trained technicians to detect the content of pathogens in food and water. In this proposal to Army we are planning to test the feasibility of our technology towards an integrated (single process) and automated instrument for near-real time in line diagnostics with 100 ml water sample spiked with known quantity of pathogens of interest."

To overcome insufficient speed, range, and payloads of existing rotorcraft, Future Vertical Lift (FVL) design considers configurations that may have multiple main rotors, ducted fans, auxiliary wings, etc. Such FVL configurations introduce additional aerodynamic lifting devices that make aerodynamic interaction an even more dominant factor to consider. The proposed research aims at developing an advanced modelling method dedicated to interactional aerodynamics analysis in support of modern rotorcraft design and development. Phase I will accomplish a modular formulation of the coupled viscous vortex particle method with a near-body solver for full rotorcraft analysis. Phase I will also accomplish the development of the software architecture and framework for coupling VPM with near-body solvers (CFD, etc.) and comprehensive codes (CSD). The feasibility of the proposed approach will be demonstrated through an aerodynamic interaction analysis of a compound rotorcraft."

Unfortunately, due to the limitations of current TWE device designs and lack of a fieldable platform for analysis, the technology is restricted to low-throughput research-based applications. Manufacturability challenges with the current TWE device include (1) imprecise spacing between top and bottom electrodes, (2) poor sealing, and (3) a lack of a unified cartridge-style format (for both ease of sample injection and attachment to electrical contacts). The objective of this study is to design and manufacture TWE devices with substantial improvements over current devices including lower cost, higher reproducibility, comparable or better precision, and ease-of-use. Nano Terra will design and manufacture devices fitting these requirements by adapting recent advances in both passive microfluidic control (i.e., degassed-driven flow) and plastic-based microfluidics to TWE. The design will be a cartridge-style format with standardized electrical contacts, may be disposable, and come prepackaged for convenience. Alterations of the channel and electrode designs to optimize device performance or multiplexing will be straightforward and relatively inexpensive."

        "abstract": "Bacteriophages (phages), viruses which specifically infect and lyse bacteria, are attractive alternatives to antibiotic therapy as they are naturally occurring, amplify in the host, are inexpensive to produce and display narrow host ranges. This latter aspect is of particular interest to therapy as, unlike broad-spectrum antibiotics which kill the both the pathogen and endogenous bacterial flora, phages do not display off target effects. However, this selective host range typically necessitates that therapeutic phages must be developed for each bacterial pathogen, and that each preparation must contain a cocktail of phages to ensure adequate species coverage. The logistical requirements needed to develop phage cocktails are immense, often requiring the isolation, characterization and host range analysis of hundreds of phages. Therefore, the development of high-throughput technologies capable of mitigating these constraints is highly desirable. Our Phase I goal is to develop rapid high-throughput technologies for the development of phage cocktails. This will be accomplished by: 1) automated isolation of clonal phage by viral-tagging and fluorescence-assisted cell sorting, 2) preferential isolation of broad-host range lytic phages, and 3) high-throughput, microtiter plate based host range analyses based on luminescence."

        "abstract": "Operational stressors, such as fatigue, environmental conditions, and information overload, have the potential to significantly degrade Soldier cognitive function and, consequently, reduce the soldier&apos;s performance on a given mission. To better understand the impacts these stressors can have on performance, an improved analytical capability based upon existing Army research needs to be developed. To address this need, Technology Solutions Experts Inc. (TSE) proposes to construct the Cognitive Degradation Modeling Toolkit (CDMT), a suite of models and tools that will provide cognitive degradation representations as well as the capability to integrate these representations in Soldier system engineering tools, Soldier and Small Unit (SSU) constructive simulations, and human performance modeling and analysis tools. As the primary developer of the Infantry Warrior Simulation (IWARS), TSE has experience constructing high-fidelity models and integrating them into constructive simulations. Using this expertise, TSE will design, develop, and integrate the CDMT, providing an improved representation of the impact of cognitive stressors on operational performance."

In order to accomplish this objective, the shelter walls will be shielded from within to eliminate the time of transitioning the exposed patient from the CT scanner to the Surgical Suite and will do so without increasing the weight of the system beyond the 15,000 lb threshold. This effort will provide the operating room, radiology, and laboratory facilities of the hospital with the required radiation protection capabilities."

This will allow the shelter to be located in the main body of the CSH, resulting in improved care for soldiers. The Army needs to shield the shelter without exceeding the overall shelter weight limit of 15,000 lb and at less than 10% cost increase of the shelter system. To accomplish this, new lightweight shelter walls must be developed with integral radiation shielding. Lightweight composite panels can offer a viable solution to this problem. NexGen Composites, in collaboration with The University of Dayton Research Institute proposes to develop novel composite materials and processes using nanoparticle based fillers of heavy elements in a low-cost polymer resin matrix as well as growing multi-walled carbon nanotubes in glass or carbon fiber. Prototype test panels will be fabricated using this new class of materials and their x-ray radiation shielding and physical characteristics will be evaluated. The materials and processes that show the most promise in Phase I will be scaled up in Phase II for fabrication of full-scale panels which will be integrated in a 20 one-side expandable ISO shelter for testing."

After a conflict is over, however, these emplaced munitions are often left behind, and their location forgotten, posing a deadly risk to innocent people who accidently detonate them. Nokomis will employ its core competency of detecting low-level emissions from electronics to develop a solution for remote identification and precise geolocation of emplaced munitions. For this effort, Nokomis demonstrate the feasibility of detecting an artificially placed RF transmitter embedded on the munition at operationally relevant ranges. The company will transition its existing unintended emissions detection capability to provide a solution that detects intended emissions signatures from an RF transmitter embedded on the munition. For this effort, Nokomis will (1) Optimize current Hiawatha sensors detection and geo-location accuracies; (2) identify most suitable RF transmitter by assessing the emission power and frequency to cooperate with the improved Hiawatha sensor systems and (3) Demonstrate ability to utilize the transmitter as an electronic beacon for detection and geolocation."

Novel, paradigm shifting technologies of RF polarized scanning and cavity sensor based direction of arrival are merged to enable discovery of emplaced munitions within a minimum zone of 10 kilometers. The spatial precision is better than 100 cm. The proposed solution naturally consumes low power. Embedding antennas into the munition ensures that the electronics occupy a volume which is less than 1 cubic inch. A single electronic scanner solution is sufficient to address the objectives of solicitation, minimizing the burden of transportation and deployment. The deployment has an extremely low probability of detection. An encrypted, low power, high speed, point-to-point, wireless link can be established with the host station for communication as needed. The scanner provides programmable capability to periodically monitor the unauthorized movement of the emplaced munition, and thus an accurate map of the emplaced munitions is always available to the host. The proposed system meets the operational time and shelf life requirement of over 20 years."

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for a system that can simultaneously measure a parachutes shape and the airflow velocity around an entire parachute system during an airdrop, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Parachute Shape and Airflow Measurement (PSAM) system. It is based on full-field imaging and optical wavefront measurement techniques. Specifically, the innovation in implementing a full-field light camera will enable PSAM to capture an entire light field comprising 3D data on the canopy shape and the angle information on the incoming rays, the directions of which are changed by airflow. Advanced image processing techniques allow extraction of 3D canopy coordinates and relative airflow velocity. This innovative system design makes the system applicable for safely testing a variety of parachute systems. Thus, the PSAM system enables us to supply true data for verification and validation of models used for design and development of airdrop systems. In Phase I, POC will determine the technical feasibility of accurate full-field mapping of canopy shape and airflow, perform a trade-off analysis to determine the best approach for a system, and develop a preliminary design. In Phase II POC will develop an operational PSAM system, and reach technology readiness level (TRL)-5\/-6."

        "abstract": "The shape of a parachute changes during the deployment of the canopy due to control inputs by the paratrooper\/guidance system and environmental effects. Current methods of measuring the shape of a parachute use wind tunnels or instrumented test chambers. These measurements are limited by blockage and scaling effects. Optical sensors (e.g. laser scanners, stereo cameras, or photogrammetry) are sensitive to sunlight and cannot measure the overall shapes of parachutes with more complicated structures, such as ram-air parachutes. Intelligent Automation, Inc. has teamed up with parachute experts\/manufacturers and proposes to develop an all-weather three-dimensional Parachute Shape Scanner (PSS) based on the Millimeter Wave Radar technique. It can be used to measure the shape of a wide variety of parachutes during an airdrop. Using the same processing architecture and sensor hardware, airflow measurements can also be conducted. The proposed PSS can provide 3D point-cloud measurement of a parachute at the rate of 10Hz with an accuracy of 2cm for the fabric portion of the canopy and 4cm for all other components above the parachute attachment point. PSS is insensitive to interferences from sunlight, rain, fog, or cloud, and can be used in day and night time."

        "abstract": "Seacoast proposes to develop a design for a wearable microdetector system that is tuned specifically for fuel-related pollutants. The system contains sensors modified with conductive graphene, to make lightweight, ultra-sensitive detectors. During the past few years there has been increasing interest in using new technologies for community-based monitoring applications, for example, for pollutants that can harm a large number of people in a specific area. However, thus far no detectors have been developed that meet the price-point to make them acceptable to the average person to carry a chemical sensor with them. Currently available sensor systems are large and expensive, requiring training to operate, or come as kits which require sample preparation and special handling. In either case, wide distribution of chemical detectors is not yet possible. By the end of Phase I, Seacoast will complete a sensor system design, evaluate materials and components, and develop a Phase II test and validation plan. Integrated display and wireless data transmission will allow for centralized logging and chemical exposure tracking, enabling crowd-sourced chemical exposure monitoring."

        "abstract": "The treatment of water with chlorine is an effective way to kill waterborne pathogens such as bacteria, parasites and viruses. This process, however, produces toxic byproducts from the chemical reaction between chlorine and natural organic matter usually referred as disinfection by-products (DBPs). The presence of DBPs in drinking water may not just cause an unpleasant organoleptic taste, but is also a matter of concern for human health. One of the most prevalent classes of DBPs, haloacetic acids (HAAs), is known to cause adverse health effects including cancer. Although, currently available standard equipment for analyzing DBPs including HAAs are effectively accurate, they require highly skilled operators and are non-portable and costly, which makes them unsuitable for battlefield use. Commercially available portable chemical monitors on the other hand show insufficient levels of performance in terms of detection limits, sensitivity to interferences and\/or are entirely non-specific. Hence, detection of trace levels of DBPs in the field still remains a significant challenge. To address the need Lynntech proposes to develop a simple rugged and portable device based on microfluidic traveling wave electrophoresis combined with a miniature UV detection system for monitoring DBPs in the field."

The system is based on a novel integration of innovative optoelectronic and millimeter wave sensors, which were proven by POC to provide accurate 3D model of locality as well as situational awareness in a degraded visual environments (DVEs). POCs extensive experience in avionic sensors, processing electronics, and system integration will benefit the proposed development. In Phase I, POC will determine technical feasibility of the ASTRA and determine where to place hardware onto the aircraft fuselage for a spherical field of regard with radial 200 m in clear air, matching Army requirements. We will study and propose electrical and mechanical interfaces for ASTRA sensors with wide potential compatibility in modern helicopters. Phase II will concentrate on building 12 prototype sensors with demonstration of sensor installation for a 3D plus time visualization of the scanned locality. We anticipate that at the end of Phase II, ASTRA will reach the technology\/manufacturing readiness level (TRL 6\/MRL 5) sufficient for testing in DVE."

Traditionally, the major limitations with existing see-spot systems is their inability to function in the presence of bright sunlight, and the inability to function when multiple spots from different sources are simultaneously present in the same field of view. A new Short Wave InfraRed (SWIR) imager has been developed which has the unique ability to provide conventional intensity imaging as well as an asynchronous &quot;see spot&quot; mode. Under this SBIR program, Quantum Imaging proposes the development of a SWIR camera which provides conventional intensity imagery and the ability to provide Coded Spot Tracking (both x-y location as well as Pulse Repetition Code identification) for any of the possible 777 unique PRF codes from 1111 to 1888. The system will eliminate the size, cost and power typically associated with a separate PRF code detection module used in legacy see-spot systems, and allow for up to identification of up to 8 simultaneously occurring spots in a given range."

The development of a standards-based, layered Cyber semantic model or ontology (with extensible data-domain-high level layers) provides users the ability to store, query and manipulate data across semantic layers, delivering the proper level of abstraction based on user needs while enabling dynamic and\/or learned semantic model revisions. We plan to integrate many previously developed point solutions while constructing other data or domain ontologies within the Cyber Ontology Based Reasoning Architecture (COBRA) effort. COBRA will apply an innovative multi-level ontological model to efficiently integrate large heterogeneous Cyber datasets. This layered Cyber ontology will enable full first-order logic reasoning and graph query heuristics which assists the characterization of complex Cyber entities and events. An innovative semantic model drift detection approach will be applied in learning new\/changed ontological concepts and properties. These innovations within COBRA will lead to a flexible\/extensible Cyber semantic model framework which captures information in legacy systems while providing a mechanism to extend to new or changing data sources."

This effort will proceed with the analytical and computational design of the metamaterial structures which can provide extinction on the order of 4.5 m^2\/g for broadband radiation while allowing narrow passbands. We will synthesize a moderate quantity of flakes in Phase I for testing and proof of feasibility."

(PSI) proposes to develop a novel betavoltaic battery based on the innovative use of conducting polymer materials combined with a high density Li-ion battery. The technology is intended for use in long term unattended communications equipment. While the proposed betavoltaic battery will achieve output power of 100 W, the addition of the Li-ion battery will allow for occasional power consumption surges of over 50 mW. The device will be designed to provide uninterrupted power for over 20 years. Because of its design, the device will be radiologically safe, thus providing the opportunity for wider use in commercial applications. This development effort will make use of recent advances in organic photovoltaic solar cell technology to produce an inexpensive, compact, flexible and scalable design. PSI will develop and characterize a prototype organic semi-conductor material in Phase I in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and validate a system model. The system model will be developed to predict power conversion efficiency and open circuit voltage. The Phase II effort will result in a TRL 5 betavoltaic battery prototype ready for operational tests in the field."

        "abstract": "Developments in ultra-low power computing are creating new opportunities for long-lived unattended sensors and network communications nodes. To achieve operational objectives, the DoD has realized that new power sources are required with lifetimes that exceed 20 years. Even under optimal conditions, state-of-the-art, commercially available power-storage devices (i.e., chemical batteries) have life-spans that rarely reach 10 years. This lifespan is substantially shortened in the face of temperature extremes and frequent duty cycling. Widetronix is commercializing betavoltaic power sources to provide extended operational lifetimes for low-power applications in defense, medical, and industrial monitoring applications. The company is targeting power outputs for these applications ranging from 5 to 25 W\/cm2. The goal of this Phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate a viable pathway for developing a commercially feasible 100 W, 20 year betavoltaic power source. By improving betavoltaic power density substantial cost reductions can be achieved, making incorporation into the DoD supply chain a reality. In Phase I Widetronix will increase the power density by improving the beta flux from a tritium source and increase the die size of a SiC betavoltaic. These improvements will be incorporated into Widetronixs textured betavoltaic devices for Phase II, which will enable the company to achieve its cost target of $10\/W 20 years."

        "abstract": "Heavy power sources with short lifetimes have been significant obstacles to realizing the full potential of various miniaturized electrical and mechanical systems developed in the recent, remarkable growth of micro\/nanotechnology. In contrast to conventional power sources, a radioisotope power source can operate for extended periods of time and in extreme environments. More importantly, the energy density (J\/kg) of radioactive material is approximately one million times greater than that of lithium ion batteries. Infinity Power will develop a stable power source for various applications and systems. Long-term reliable electrical power will be collected using radioisotope materials. The capability to employ the radiolytic radical battery as a portable, stand-alone device in both normal and extreme environments depends on the development of proper design compatible with the miniaturization of the MEMS technology. The benefits of the proposed activity include: 1) increased lifetime of the power source; 2) utilization of environment-friendly materials; 3) increased energy density; and 4) improvement of the performance by utilizing the nanostructure materials. Thus, the power source developed in this project will meet various key requirements. Since our new radioisotope-based power source can last very long, many commercial applications will be available."

ORS, in consultation with the customer, will down-select the most promising system configuration and perform a detailed design in the Phase I option period. This will set the basis for Phase II fabrication, field testing, and iterated improvements of a prototype system. ORS staff will rely on their prior experience with both borehole and noninvasive soil NMR systems, as well as experience, acquired at previous firms, with noninvasive systems for landmine detection using the related technology of nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) that faced similar performance requirements and operational constraints."

Total water content measurements are also invaluable for ascertaining the capability of soil to support mechanized military equipment and operations. Conventional methods are often bulky, invasive and rely on inferred rather than direct measurement of soil moisture. We propose to develop and demonstrate Surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SNMR) geophysical instrumentation capable of measuring near-surface soil moisture content as a function of depth in the top 2 meters of the subsurface. We combine new ultrasensitive compact magnetic sensors integrated with a relatively high-power transmitter and control system into a noninvasive and portable instrument package. A modular design enables integration with time- or frequency-domain electromagnetic (EM) methods yielding enhanced characterization and potential for joint processing and inversion of co-located SNMR and EM data."

Unfortunately, existing technologies for pathogen detection in food and water are too slow and inefficient  taking days to conclude, and requiring either intense labor in a dedicated laboratory or expensive capital equipment. We propose to develop a sensitive, rapid and simple diagnostic platform for the multiplex detection and quantitation of foodborne bacterial pathogens, as well as waterborne viruses and parasites. Our platform involves a single disposable cartridge in which all steps of the assay can be run without any user intervention. In this Phase I project, we will begin to develop and optimize assays for prototypical organisms, with a goal to demonstrate under 1-hour assays for quantitation and under 8-hour (single shift) assays for detection (at the single organism level) of foodborne pathogens. This would allow, for the first time, a near real-time, single-shift, monitoring of bacterial contamination in packaged food facilities  saving days of shelf life on perishable foods, and saving lives by helping to more effectively monitor the food and water supply chain."

        "abstract": "In this SBIR Phase I proposal, Kent Optronics Inc proposes to design and validate a compressive spectral sensor for multiple military missions. The sensor is expected to enable both multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) sensing capability. The multispectral sensing is for wide area situational awareness and target tracking; while hyperspectral sensing for target recognition\/identification. The sensor exhibits the following key remarkable features: 61 Flexible switching between MS and HS sensing modes under user desire, from a single sensor system; 61 Zoomable field of view (FOV) of 60o; 61 Fast sampling rate and imagery display refresh at video rate or greater; 61 Reduced data volume and data transmission bandwidth; 61 Optional spatial and spectral fovea driven by the detection result(s); 61 Small foot-print profile in size, weight, power consumption, and cost (SwaPC). In Phase I, a thorough trade analysis among all the candidate approaches will be performed, leading to an optimal sensor design. In Phase II, a pre-prototype will be developed."

        "abstract": "Multi-point initiators used in modern explosive projectiles rely on high voltage capacitors which can deliver high power in a low inductance configuration. Current capacitors meeting the required performance specifications are based on dielectric ceramics in multi-layer configurations. These capacitors cost as much as $100 and have a volume of over 400 mm3. This translates to $200-400\/J\/cm3, consequently, the use of multi-point initiators for many ARDEC applications is limited by size and cost of these capacitors. In response to this need, TPL proposes development of a revolutionary capacitor technology based on high energy density polymer-nanoparticle dielectrics. Previous work by TPL has defined a nanocomposite material system with an intrinsic energy density capability that exceeds conventional dielectrics by an order of magnitude. Further, the dielectric can be processed as a polymer and is compatible with low cost circuit board manufacturing processes. The proposed program will be directed at establishing manufacturing processes for multi-layer nanocomposite capacitors with form factor similar to conventional capacitors but with significantly reduced size and cost. Phase I objectives include a detailed design, cost analysis and proof of concept demonstration for capacitors with two orders of magnitude reduction in cost\/energy density, $1-4\/J\/cm3."

To accomplish this goal, Protection Engineering Consultants, LLC (PEC) has teamed with GS Engineering, Inc. (GSE) to propose an innovative research and development effort for enhanced lower leg protection, based on crushable glass foam technology, which PEC has recently used for developing aircraft arrestor beds. LOTRIF will include a floating floor panel and edge-support compactors as well as mechanically optimized chassis attachments. As described in the proposal, materials and components will be evaluated, potential designs of the system will be developed and initial proof-of-principle testing will be performed. GSE will help commercialize the final LOTRIF system design."

        "abstract": "Current grid-based topographic products are not capable of representing near-vertical surfaces in the terrain such as ditches and washes to the fidelity required by modern scene based flight simulations. Torch proposes the development of a simple, efficient approach for the design of a toolset capable of identifying and generating high-fidelity near-vertical terrain features or using a-priori identification and integrating them into existing terrain topography at the high resolution required for an accurate thermal solution. This process incorporates modern image-processing techniques to identify and generate the high-fidelity terrain features and leverages massively parallel computational architectures to achieve this with a rapid, automated approach. The design is flexible both in software architecture, allowing multiple algorithms and methods of identifying and generating the terrain features, and hardware, allowing the usage of either high-density CPU or GPGPU architectures. By focusing on effective user interfaces and processes to minimize necessary labor, this allows the modeler to rapidly generate the necessary terrain models and integrate them into the thermal simulation and flight simulations for performance assessments. This process should allow integration into existing topographic software such as ERDAS Imagine, but is also relevant to many applications to the GeoSpatial community including feature detection and scene generation."

As part of this evaluation effort, we will conduct a proof-of-concept experiment of select 3D flow diagnostics at Auburn University using a custom built plenoptic camera. Based on this analysis and with significant consultation with our ground test partner, we will formulate a detailed plan for the development and implementation of a plenoptic based flow measurement technique to be executed in phase II.

For metals emphasis will be given in implementing a multiscale experimental mechanics approach consisting of standard laboratory testing coupled with the multispectral approach developed at Drexel University. To complement this approach we will further perform experiments using miniature mechanical testing with microscopes for direct microstructure evolution measurements. Our approach will provide rich datasets to our computational models that will focus on two major objectives. The first is related to the use of computational mechanics approaches to produce simulation results that have the capability to replicate effects observed by our nondestructive measurements with the additional task to create modeling strategies to feed actual experimental data into such models. The second objective will be to use this approach in a prediction framework that will be based on Probabilistic Structural Risk Assessment (PSRA) and Bayesian updates to determine pathways towards remaining useful life estimates. Our plan for Phase II and commercialization of this approach will be further addressed."

        "abstract": "Network modernization is one of the Armys top priorities. Tactical edge MANETs possess a set of unique challenges. Social metrics such as centrality and between-ness have proven to be useful in routing decisions in traditional MANETs. However, these routing protocols are based on link state information, which may become stale as the degree of mobility is increased, as in the tactical edge. Tactical edge networks possess some important characteristics that may be beneficial; for example, roles, organizational relationships, and mission plans. This a priori information can be translated into a set of mathematical objects that may be utilized by novel protocols. Such protocols would equip Army networks with heretofore untapped potential, ensuring information superiority for deployed forces. UtopiaCompression (UC) proposes a routing algorithm that exploits a priori mission information and operates independent of link state information. The a priori information is converted into a set of novel social metrics. Reducing the data to social metrics allows the routing problem to be formulated mathematically. UC, will design a hybrid social metric, based roughly on the Social-Tie concept, and associated protocols. The metric leads to a new definition of centrality tailored specifically to the tactical edge MANET."

D-MAARC will: 1) operate in a disrupted communications environment, 2) produce plans AND re-plans that are easy for operators to understand, 3) allow for plug-and-play with a variety of unmanned platforms. D-MAARC will achieve these goals by providing contingency policies that are human-understandable and represent approved and optimized responses to plan disruptions, including loss of communications. D-MAARC will employ an architecture based on open source standards as well as develop modular and model-based components that will allow the underlying algorithms to adjust to the parameterized inputs of a variety of platforms. In order to develop the technology, STR will develop models for policy and contingency representation, using a combination of decomposition and hierarchical representation to make information more accessible to the operator, as well as make the associated algorithms tractable. We will then develop algorithms for evaluating policies based on stochastic rollout to ensure robustness to disruptions. This Phase I work will lay the groundwork for live demonstrations in Phase II."

        "abstract": "There is a growing need for compact, low cost, high resolution sensor systems capable of operating when poor weather conditions impair existing optical systems. Millimeter-wave (mmW) systems offer an excellent solution to this challenge since they are less vulnerable to these impairments while still providing higher resolution and smaller form factors than lower frequency systems. As silicon-based mmW processes continue to mature, active mmW beamforming sensors are becoming an increasingly attractive option for meeting the current situational awareness shortfall. In response to this need, MaXentric has teamed with NCSU to propose a development effort codenamed MIRAS (mm-Wave Imaging with Repurposed Arrays) focused on the design of a silicon-based W-band imaging system. As part of this effort, our team proposes to investigate the mmW imaging parameter and topology tradespace to create a prototype blueprint for future Phase II fabrication and testing. As part of the effort, our team will leverage technologies developed under several previous and ongoing mmW, beamforming, and IC prototype efforts by both MaXentric and NCSU to accelerate development and provide proof-of-concept demonstrations in Phase I."

The SRM industry has identified rayon precursor fiber as a critical material for the continued long-term production and development of SRM systems. To date, there is no domestic equivalent nor is there a commercially viable equivalent process to make these cellulosic fibers without the use of highly polluting and toxic chemicals. MATECH has partnered with the University of Alabama in Huntsville to leverage the Kaukler-Process (a green process that employs safe and recyclable ionic liquids) and MATECHs substantial experience in process scale-up, heat treatment, and spool-to-spool continuous fiber manufacturing, to lift an innovative low cost, low conductivity, domestically sustainable aerospace-grade carbon fibers as reinforcement for carbon phenolic ablative rocket nozzle insulators as an alternative to NARC\/Enka rayon-based carbon fibers still in use today. MATECH and its corporate partners plan to identify potential road-blocks to scale-up to mature this technology, raising both the TRL and MRL of ILCF in activities notionally planned for the Phase II effort."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for a head-wearable integrated video decompression micro-display that is capable of directly receiving compressed video signal and displaying the decompressed video to the human eye, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Wearable INtelligent Display (WIND). It is based on a novel design that employs an integrated system on a chip (SoC) with a real-time video decoder to process compressed video streams and interface directly with an integrated micro-display. This innovation enables the micro-display pixels to be driven directly from the decoded video signal components utilizing the intricacies of the decompression algorithms, eliminating the need for any intermediate standard conversions such as VGA, HDMI, and DVI. As a result, WIND is a highly integrated, low-power, low-latency, and lightweight micro-display that directly receives and displays high-quality compressed video streams over wireless networks and is designed specifically for head-wearable application. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of WIND by designing, modeling, and simulating the design in a software validation platform that analyzes the validity of the approach and identifies potential issues. In Phase II, POC will develop a hardware feasibility design packaged with a micro-display with supporting hardware and software."

        "abstract": "Multiple antenna systems, commonly referred as multiple and output multiple output (MIMO) system multiply the link capacity by using multiple transmit and receive antennas for transmitting and receiving more than one data signal simultaneously via multipath propagation. MIMO is known to provide major spectral efficiency gains over single antenna systems by balancing diversity-multiplexing trade-offs. This capability has been extensively studied for point-to-point MIMO systems and further extended to multiple access and broadcast channels with different transmitter-receiver configurations leading to multi-user MIMO. MIMO has a strong potential to improve data communications, connectivity and situational awareness when applied to tactical mobile ad hoc network (MANET). By taking into account network dynamics, this MIMO MANET paradigm is modeled as combinations of different MU-MIMO settings corresponding to multiple access, broadcast and interference channels (with different unicast, multicast and broadcast subcategories). We propose AMMO (Advanced MIMO MANET Optimization) system to improve MANET communications with the application of multiuser MIMO under realistic protocol and radio implementation constraints and requirements, including innovative solutions regarding channel estimation, feedback mechanism and dynamic scheduling of transmitter-receiver configurations."

The nanostructured coatings will be deposited on silicon substrates and characterized in detail, including optical reflection and transmittance versus wavelength and performance characteristics as a function of incident angle of light. The performance of nanostructured antireflection coatings can also be tailored for specific applications. In this program, antireflection coating designs will be developed for near infrared (NIR), mid-wave- length infrared (MWIR), and long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) detectors and their associated optics. The Phase I designs will be prototyped and further evaluated and improved in Phase II. Phase I reporting shall include the nanostructured designs scientific and technical merit and feasibility, while also addressing the overall business case viability for projected EO\/IR sensors and imaging systems markets."

        "abstract": "Non-lethal weapons incapacitate or repel with a low probability of fatality or permanent injury. Because of a global rise in asymmetric warfare, street riots, insurgency and mass demonstrations, use of NLWs has been increasing steadily. Rapid market growth combined with increasing wrongful death litigation has created an intensely competitive research and development effort to commercialize new and improved NLWs. Current NLW research is limited by the lack of universally accepted standard test protocols or materials. No synthetic ballistic skin simulant currently exists that is homogeneous, accessible, affordable, easy to handle, has a stable shelf life and exhibits dynamic biomechanical equivalence to human skin. In addition, there is desire for mathematical models that allow accurate and precise prediction of measures of lethality with a reasonable amount of ballistic data. There are very few published computational models of skin penetration and most of these have been focused on knife penetration. While a few computatiojnal models exist that focus on the projectile mechanics, significant opportunity remains to incorporate improved predictive value based on the biomechanics of skin. Luna Innovations proposes to develop companion physical and constitutive models of human skin."

        "abstract": "To address the desire for a conductive network for parachute fabrics, Corvid Technologies proposes to develop a process to selectively apply conductive silicone rubber to conventional nylon fabric, characterize treated fabric performance, and develop a power and data network architecture. The proposed approach addresses the technical challenges associated with conductivity and durability in flexible networks and the unique challenges related to power and communications, including conduction across seams, EMI protection, and the integration of network elements. The conductive parachute network is intended to have a minimal impact on fabric performance to address the specification of a 20% maximum variance from the performance of conventional PIA-C-44378 Type IV material with respect to strength, weight, flexibility, and durability and the specification of a minimum seam efficiency of 80%. The flexible conductive network enables sensor and actuator integration in support of capabilities such as in-situ fabric performance characterization and enhanced precision of autonomously guided parachutes. Anticipated benefits specific to the approach include the versatility to fabricate application-specific networks at the time of parachute assembly and reduced developmental risk resulting from material maturity and availability of a variety of COTS formulations. Commercialization will focus on licensing technology in the e-textile and wearable electronics markets."

        "abstract": "With an increasing use of stem cells and engineered tissues in therapeutics and drug screening, cryopreservation has become important to enable a continuous quality-controlled supply and transportation. Current tissues cryopreservation techniques have shown limited success due to the use of cytotoxic cryoprotective agents (CPA). There is a substantial need for new CPA solutions exhibiting minimal toxicity that can provide functional preserved tissues. The objective of this proposal is to develop a new bioinspired CPA solution to minimize toxicity and achieve viable tissues post vitrification and rewarming. Here, we propose to develop and use a 3D microtissue model, as an in-vitro screening tool to evaluate bioinspired CPA cocktails. We expect that the developed bioinspired solutions will enable the successful biopreservation of viable tissue constructs. Once fully developed, this novel CPA solutions would improve the supply of 1) existing tissue engineered products, also on the battlefield, 2) vascularized complex tissue and vital organs, important for both military and civil tissue bio-banks and 3) cells\/tissues for drug testing and discovery."

        "abstract": "The growing capability of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has changed the face of the modern battlefield. Our enemies are beginning to exploit these new resources in ways that pose substantial threats not only to our deployed warfighters, but also to American citizens on our own soil. Because these threats are not well-addressed by our existing defense infrastructure, it is imperative that technologies be developed and fielded to proactively and preemptively close this capability gap. FIRST RFs proposed approach to meet these requirements is based on a multi-sensor, multi-platform, and multi-mode architecture that provides the greatest surveillance area and reliability for the lowest cost. We believe this architecture provides unparalleled adaptability, scalability, and dynamic reconfigurability by providing a suite of technologies that can be selected and deployed to provide a counter-UAS shield that is customized to its emplacement. During the proposed Phase I effort, FIRST RF will conduct an architecture study to evaluate the capabilities of each component sensor technology, and recommend an overall approach that jointly optimizes them in order to provide the best performance for the lowest cost. Leveraging the results of this study, preliminary hardware demonstrations are planned for the Phase I Option."

It is presently suspected that the short carrier lifetimes and some dark current arise due to a native point defect, possibly the Ga\/In antisites (a III-group atom on the V-group sublattice), creating a mid-gap state within the SLS band gap that facilitates Shockley-Read-Hall generation\/recombination. Sivananthan Laboratories, Inc. proposes to use molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the types and distributions of defects as a function of MBE growth parameters, and tight binding electronic structure calculations to evaluate the effect of defects on lifetimes and hence dark currents, thus producing a fully computational method to relate MBE process parameters to device performance. Possible growth process improvements will be considered, based on the identified deleterious defects and associated process parameters, and tested using the proposed computational method. Experiments will then be performed to verify the theoretical understanding and optimize a growth process based on the theoretical predictions."

The sensors are fabricated directly on the gas turbine engine component using proprietary fabrication processes developed at Acree using proven high-temperature materials with a matching Coefficient of Thermal Expansion to that of the CMC and the Environmental Barrier Coating. A critical insulating layer made of a highly dense and nanocrystalline material is deposited as a supporting layer for the sensors in order to overcome the porosity of the EBC-CMC materials.

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for high-temperature sensors for advanced turbine engine materials, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Integrated Fiber Optic Sensor (IFOS) system. This proposed solution is based on a new design of microsensors fabricated of high-temperature-resistant ceramics supplemented by POCs proprietary wireless technology. Specifically, the innovation in use of p-SiAlCN ceramics for sensor fabrication, design of multilayered and arrayed microsensor structures, and use of POCs proprietary wireless technology, will enable the IFOS to survive high-temperature environments, to produce reliable measurements, and to realize secure and reliable wireless data transmission. As a result, this sensor system offers operating temperature exceeding the Army requirements of 2700 deg F for at least 3000 hot\/3000 cold hr with measurement error within +\/-1%. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of IFOS by fabricating a temperature sensor and testing it to show survival at 2400 deg F for 250 hot\/250 cold hr with measurement error within +\/-2% error for temperature measurement, to reach TRL-3. In Phase II, POC plans to develop three types of sensors (temperature, pressure, and strain), meeting all Army requirements including wireless data transmission. The Phase II IFOS will reach TRL-4 to -5."

        "abstract": "Dengue fever incidence has grown exponentially over the past 50 years and now causes disease in nearly 100 million people annually. Vaccination offers the most effective method of protecting at-risk individuals. The long immunization schedule (12 months) and partial protection (30-60%) of the latest vaccines set clear milestones for improvement. International travelers and Warfighters being deployed to tropical or subtropical regions require more immediate and more complete immunity. To this end Qrono, in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, proposes to computationally optimize and develop a transformational microparticle adjuvant platform (M2) that will generate rapid onset immunity in a new dengue vaccine through molecularly engineered control over antigen uptake and T cell stimulation. The ultimate goal for this new vaccine is to rapidly protect against dengues manifestations (i.e., fever, hemorrhaging and sepsis-like shock) with a single dose. Qronos computational drug delivery technology allows us to rapidly create the formulations that will optimize M2s adjuvant effect. Subsequent studies will continue vaccine development through preclinical efficacy studies in mouse and monkey models before beginning the clinical trials needed for regulatory approval and commercialization."

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for a very high dynamic range two-tone measurement instrument, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Automated Two-Tone Very High Dynamic Range RF (A2D) Instrument. The proposed A2D instrument consists of two basic subsystems: a very high dynamic range analog front end, and a broadband, flexible, automated digital backend. Because A2D builds on mature in-house technologies and an established measurement technique, high payoff is expected with minimal risk. Innovations in the system architecture enable A2D to resolve intermodulation products from test signals separated by as much as 100 MHz or as little as 1 Hz. As a result of its unique design, the A2D instrument offers broadband dynamic range of 120 dB or more in a compact form factor, which directly addresses the Army requirements for a flexible, automated, commercially available instrument. In Phase I, POC will conduct a proof-of-principle demonstration to show that this A2D approach meets the Army specifications for the RF instrument. Phase I will include modeling and benchtop measurements, to bring the technology readiness level (TRL) to 4. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and demonstrate a compact, packageable prototype measurement instrument to reach TRL 6."

To address this need, Luna Innovations proposes the development of robust nanofiber bandages to be used for the closure of full-thickness corneal lacerations. These bandages will be optically transparent to enable visualization of the healing process, with physical and biological properties suitable for this rigorous application."

From vehicle accidents to explosions, a soldier can experience TBI over a range of conditions with widely varying degrees of severity. While the diagnosis of moderate to severe TBI is usually straightforward, mild TBI events are hard to identify, diagnose, and monitor over time. ViGYAN is developing a suite of advanced signal processing techniques for the identification of abnormal speech audio patterns as a marker for TBI events. The TBI-ASAP methodology will leverage advanced signal analysis, statistical process control techniques, and modeling with wavelet decomposition\/synthesis. These methods are currently used successfully by ViGYAN in the analyses of large aerodynamic datasets. Applied in conjunction with expertise and data from the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC), the use of these methods will be specifically customized, optimized, and employed based on expected effects of TBI on speech signals; development and validation of an early prototype of the technique will be based on relevant fresh data obtained in ViGYANs research laboratory and from the VCU Emergent Clinical Trial and Observation Recruitment (VECTOR) program. These TBI-ASAP techniques will be implemented in a range of devices to facilitate the rapid screening and identification of a TBI event as well as facilitate ongoing monitoring and quantification of TBI recovery. ViGYAN will document and correlate other abnormal speech patterns caused by non-TBI brain pathologies to assure identification of TBI-only diagnoses."

To provide this assurance, several techniques have been developed. One of the most effective and low-cost is software fuzzing, which randomly and semi-randomly permutes software inputs (e.g. files or network data). The software being tested is monitored for crashes which generally indicate poor code quality and potential security vulnerabilities. Fuzzing generally produces hundreds or thousands of crashes, each a candidate software vulnerability that must be mitigated. Each crashing input needs to be manually evaluated for exploitability and the severity of the vulnerability. The severity of each crash is a valuable metric to helps prioritize limited remediation resources. What if a system could characterize a crash, automatically, in terms of severity This document proposes the initial research into and the development of an advanced exploitability reasoning system."

SimQuests Surface Wound Mapping (SWM) software suite demonstrates our capability for surface wound databasing, building realistic 3D models, coding and quantifying internal injuries, and creating military-relevant analytic products. For this project, SimQuest proposes to determine the feasibility of a Burn Wound Mapping (BWM) application based on SWM. We will apply our expertise in medical image segmentation to aid clinicians in precisely placing and categorizing burn wounds on the model. The resultant BWM application will have (1) a realistic 3D body model that can adapt to body morphologies; (2) realistic, patient-specific visualization of burn area including cross-linked clickable model annotations and source imagery; (3) accurate calculation of burn statistics including surface area percentages (TBSA) and CFUs based on size and location; (4) identification of therapeutic interventions; and (5) ability to track patient metrics such as healing rate overall\/by area, by surface area involvement over time, and by CFUs. Integration with our existing SWM suite will provide a product that fully represents the databasing and clinical needs of the multi-mechanistic, multisystem pathology characterizing combat trauma and sequelae."

        "abstract": "Chronic and severe eye wounds are extremely painful, and may fail to heal leading to a potential loss of vision. It is estimated that over 17% of all military field casualties are due to a traumatic ocular injury. There is a need to develop new approaches to treat the injured eye that enhance regeneration of the ocular surface. The proposed novel, first-in-class silk-derived protein (SDP) ophthalmic formulation will simultaneously enhance regeneration and reduce inflammation associated with traumatic ocular injuries, while providing immediate and prolonged comfort during use for the injured patient. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying a SDP fraction that is optimized for enhancing the regeneration process on the ocular surface after the occurrence of traumatic injury as demonstrated in an in vitro model system of ocular injury. Production of the SDP is fully scalable to large quantities, and can be easily packaged and distributed similarly to a standard eye drop. The product is therefore amenable to transport in the field and to immediate application to the ocular surface upon injury. Leadership, commercialization partners, clinical advisers, and technical team are in place to support the full commercialization of the proposed product."

The proposed 3D\/4D imaging system is based upon POC-developed adaptive optic technologies and unique applied algorithms for processing plenoptic camera data. The innovations in APPRISE will enable the combination of interchangeable high quality commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) F-mount primary optics and evolving imaging array technologies to form an optimized adaptive real-time 3D\/4D imaging system. During Phase I, this passive imaging technology, when coupled with POC algorithms, offers to simultaneously provide 20 Hz video co-registered adaptive spatial and angular (range) resolution information to meet mission requirements while maintaining a portable size weight and power (SWaP) envelope, which directly addresses the Armys requirements for timely actionable intelligence and geo-spatial data. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the APPRISE system by building a prototype, collecting 4D imagery on structured indoor and outdoor (up to 4 km) scenes, and then analyzing the data and effectiveness of POC algorithms. In Phase II, POC plans to build, test, and deliver an integrated APPRISE system."

We use the qualifier mathematical to mean that in such an ontology, every type (or class) has a distinct mathematical interpretation to contrast it with many ontologies today that differ little from conventional data models or schemas. We will leverage such an ontology we developed for the DoD CIO and Joint Staff. Its upper foundation is extensional, higher-order, and 4-dimensional. Domain patterns extend from the foundation, e.g., for capabilities, desired effects, risk, resources, activity\/process models, and for data fusion, specifically the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) fusion levels 0-3. The-domain patterns were developed using an innovative rational reconstruction process that forces extensions to have mathematical meaning. We will apply this process to CybOX, MAEC, STIX, and other cyber languages to incorporate them into the ontology in such that their mathematical meanings are known. This will be important to the JIE Global and Enterprise Operations Centers and their interaction with CYBERCOM, ARCYBER, and other NETOPS and cyber intelligence and operations centers where distributed analytics are inevitable and must be interoperable and resiliency is critical."

        "abstract": "TIAX LLC proposes an improved shelter heating system based on modular radiant flooring panels to dramatically cut fuel consumption for shelter heating. The TIAX flooring system is a hydronic system, powered by direct fuel-fired water heating. This configuration reduces the total heating demand of a typical HDT STAT 32 Airbeam shelter by about 20%. In conjunction with the switch to direct fuel-fired heating vs. the current electric powered heating, the reduction in primary fuel usage is greater than 70% during extreme cold weather (outdoor ambient -25 F). A further advantage of the hydronic system is that it can be powered from existing heat sources, such as a stationary engine genset or vehicle engine coolant loop, solar thermal collectors, or other liquid-cooled systems. In these cases, a separate water boiler is not required, and the heat supplied can be effectively free. The lightweight system is capable of outputting 60,000 BTU\/h and achieving comfort conditions inside the shelter during extreme weather conditions. The unique panel design makes the system both rugged and quickly deployable."

Polaris Sensor Technologies will investigate a variety of sensing modalities across the infrared to improve acquisition and tracking performance in adverse weather. Atmospheric propagation models will be used and additional models developed to assess atmospheric and weather effects of representative RAM signatures. The effort will focus on optimal choice of spectral band and the potential for polarimetric sensing to improve signal to background ratios but will also include the impact of these signatures on acquisition and tracking system performance. Model results will be compared to measurements. System concepts will be developed based on the results and the Phase II effort will build and demonstrate the optimal system."

Reducing cooling requirements allows integration in lighter and more compact systems. Good performance at higher operating temperatures can be provided by a system based on HgCdTe infrared detectors utilizing optimized material parameters (i.e. doping and defects) and non-equilibrium device architectures that suppress detector diffusion current, such as the PIN hetero-junction photodiode. This architecture can eliminate Auger generated diffusion current, resulting in a diodes whose performance is only limited by Shockley-Read (S-R) lifetime of the HgCdTe material. In Phase I, processes for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth, doping and post-annealing will be optimized, resulting in a significant improvement in S-R lifetimes and hence depletion dark current. Integration of improved material into high performance photodetectors will be demonstrated. The efforts on material analysis and test diodes in Phase I will be extended to focal plane arrays in Phase II."

Analysts require an understanding of the causes and effects of fatigue and supporting data (i.e., to characterize fatigue) and need a way to represent and assess the cognitive effects of fatigue on decision making and physical activities. To address this, we propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a Dynamic Representation for Evaluating the Effect of Moderators and Stress on Performance (DREEMS). DREEMS is a research program to characterize fatigue and other stressors, define the elements of operation effectiveness in terms of critical tasks and processes, and develop a methodology for finding, analyzing, and using data to characterize the effects of fatigue on operational effectiveness. DREEMS provides the knowledge and data to support modeling the degradation in performance of physical and decision-making tasks in a constructive simulation."

        "abstract": "Technology for projectiles is rapidly advancing, including their fuzing and guidance technologies. Though wireless fuze setting technology based on radio frequencies (RF) has been around for some time, including new developments by Orbital ATK , optical programming methods, such as Rheinmetalls 40mm airburst ammunition, are being shown to be more advantageous for numerous reasons. Creative Microsystems Corporation (CMC), proposes to develop an advanced wireless fuze setter technology for next generation ammunition. Based on previous work that CMC performed for a 2-way optical link in projectiles, internal IRAD funded efforts, and intellectual property, in addition to our team&apos;s expertise in fuzing and small to large caliber ammunition, we will develop a robust, adaptable 2-way comm system that can fit in anything from 20mm or greater and have the ability to program 16+ rounds\/min. CMC also possess capabilities to develop long shelf-life set-back power sources for the rounds, as we developed for our projectile program. We can upscale these and improve upon them if need be. The results of Phase 1 will be a down selected design for an optical fuze setter that meets all the programs requirements, demonstrations of the technology, and whether it will be used in flight or near the breech. If the system is designed to be used in flight, it will enable future guided rounds to be realized."

Successful development of the LBWPT system will provide urgently needed capability to significantly extend the operational time of a variety of autonomously operating devices and sensors for military and commercial applications, including robotic systems, unmanned aerial systems (UASs), surveillance systems, devices for remote chemical and biological detection, as well as free-space communications systems. The proposed innovative development will reduce warfighters exposure to enemy forces, as well as reduce the risk of uncovering the location of emplaced powered devices and sensors. LBWPT development will also significantly reduce the on-board battery weight of electrically-powered systems, and will increase the useful payload of the systems. In addition, the LBWPT system provides a unique capability of remotely supplying power to contaminated sites or inaccessible areas that pose a significant personnel threat, such as nuclear stations and chemical plants destroyed by natural disasters, such as the earthquakes or tsunami."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for improved sensor technologies that blend synergistically into the aerostat environment, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Optical Aperture Synthesis Imaging Sensor (OASIS) system. The proposed OASIS system is based on the novel integration of a coherent distributed aperture telescope array, a solid-state laser array, a dispersion compensated optical waveguide, high-resolution CMOS sensor arrays, and real-time Fourier telescopy image processor electronics to provide a unique airborne sensor solution. The innovative use of coherent phase-locked distributed telescopes and active illumination lasers, together with imaging sensors phase-coupled via local oscillator reference, results in day\/night long-range coherent imaging with a large effective aperture of minimum size (volume), weight, and power, with high resolution and pointing accuracy, while mitigating atmospheric disturbances. In Phase I, POC will design and perform an initial proof-of-principle OASIS system via modeling and simulation for application on an airborne platform, and demonstrate its feasibility by a laboratory setup. In Phase II, a benchtop breadboard prototype OASIS system will be constructed using scaled components. The prototype will demonstrate the active Fourier telescopy method for real-time compensation of the flexure\/torsion effect on baseline change, demonstrating its suitability for aircraft, aerostat, or UAV applications."

        "abstract": "Syntronics, LLC proposes the development of a simple and secure non-contact fuze setter that uses bi-directional optical data transmission coupled with either Near Field Magnetic Inductance (NFMI) or optical transfer to provide external power to the fuze - both approaches will be investigated. Bi-directional transfer of data in RS-232 format without randomization or other special processing on either end of the data link being required greatly reduces processing electronics required internal to the fuze. The fuze setter data input would be directly compatible with a USB 2.0 interface, making any computer, such as the Army Rugged Handheld Computer, the fuze setter. Depending on the amount of power required by the fuze being set, the power link could also be USB 2.0 compatible. This approach allows the fuze setter to be made extremely small, with the power transfer, solid state optical components, and all of the data link electronics easily contained in less than 1 cubic inch. Since only a connection to any computing platform with a USB 2.0 port would be required, the need for the costly development of fuze setting hardware specific to a fuze or smart weapon is eliminated."

        "abstract": "Helios Remote Sensing Systems, Inc. proposes to identify methods to extract meteorological measurements from Counter-fire Target Acquisition (CTA) radar echoes to provide the radar and counterfire weapon with ballistic trajectory correction estimates and the crew with hazardous weather warnings. This capability is needed when joint meteorological data from the US Air Force is not available due to downed communications, or when the US Air Force&apos;s radar coverage isn&apos;t available or isn&apos;t at the granularity or pedigree required to improve CTA radar performance and improve counter-fire locations. During Phase I, we will analyze and conduct modeling and simulation to determine the feasibility of utilizing see-through-the-sensor technology for ballistic trajectory correction and hazardous weather warning. We will develop an initial concept design and model key elements to conduct proof of concept. During Phase II we will design and develop a see-through-the-sensor prototype and conduct testing to prove feasibility over extended operating conditions."

        "abstract": "Burn patient outcomes are dependent on the wound surface area as a percent of the total body surface area (%TBSA), burn locations, burn depth, and patient age. %TBSA is essential in determining fluid resuscitation and nutrition support, and surgical intervention and rehabilitation planning. The proposed burn injury assessment software tool is aimed at increasing %TBSA accuracy by improving on both TBSA and burn area estimations. Conventional methods (Rule-of-Palm\/Nines and Lund-Browder chart) use a generic 2D body shape diagram to represent the human body which lacks the capability to capture 3D anthropometric variability of actual human body shapes, resulting in inaccurate %TBSA. This burn assessment tool will include an interactive anthropometry-based human body generator to create, in real-time, a personalized 3D body shape model that has been morphed according to available subset of adjustable anthropometric measurements (weight, age, gender, height, waist, arms and legs measurements) as stored in most anthropometry databases. To improve on burn area estimations, the burn tool will allow the user to interactively demarcate burn areas of varying severity directly on the personalized 3D model for calculation of %TBSA. Further enhancements will involve the use of available photographic images of burned body parts to assist in burn demarcation."

The SBIR initially focuses on these two radar systems since they are managed by PM Radars in Aberdeen Proving Grounds, but the technology and capabilities will be developed to support expansion to other ground-based radars that may be suitable such as the MPQ-64 Sentinel and MPQ-53 Patriot radars. BCIs through-the-sensor weather processing on the TPQ-50 and TPQ-53 will provide capabilities that are not currently available to the Army without a dedicated weather radar, enhancing the Armys capability to accurately locate and engage enemy artillery positions and providing hazardous weather detection which support for troop movement planning, helicopter flight operations, and other non-artillery-centric Army activities, particularly when Air Force weather data are unavailable."

        "abstract": "High-fidelity representation of terrain morphology is a critical requirement for accurate modeling and generation of infrared background scenes. The current state of the art in terrain representation for missile seeker systems and other military applications is based on digital elevation models, which are relatively coarse in resolution and have smooth contours that do not resolve the presence of discrete surface transitions and undulations. Consequently, the resulting generated scenes fail to capture the effects of medium-length scale non-horizontal terrain features such as ditches, gulches, washes, and road shoulders. To address this need, Creare proposes to develop a high-fidelity terrain signature modeling framework. This framework will account for the presence of medium-length scale non-horizontal terrain features in simulated infrared scenes, through physics-based modeling of thermal effects and radiative emissions."

EdgeWare is game changing because it pulls delivery of important information to the combat soldier and reflectively pushes information from the combat soldier to commanders and other support organizations such as medical, logistic, and intelligence services. Military medical services desire to equip Nett Warrior EUDs with software which partitions the device into different levels of security domains, neither of which can physically access the other such that the user could generate the required patient encounter documentation in the unclassified partition and transmit over an unclassified network or through an unclassified tunnel through a classified (SIPRNET) network connection, thereby maintaining the unclassified status of the patient encounter record. The software we propose will run on the Nett Warrior system and will meet or otherwise satisfy NSA standards for maintaining physical separation between classified and unclassified processing domains. In Phase I MSI will system engineer, design a prototype for enabling multi-security domain applications to process and transmit data from a Combat Medics Electron EUD."

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposal is to develop an adenovirus-like particle (AdVLP) platform technology to create safe and highly efficacious multivalent adenovirus vaccines that can be manufactured in a rapid and cost-efficient manner and can be formulated in a powder composition to facilitate storage, distribution and administration. VLPs are structures resembling native virus, however they do not contain viral genetic material and therefore are unable to replicate or cause infection. The particulate nature of the VLPs together with the display of an array of repetitive surface antigens make VLP vaccine compositions highly immunogenic as clearly demonstrated by the two licensed VLP based vaccines, HPV and Hepatitis B. Our strategy for creating AdVLP is based on co-expression in mammalian cells of adenovirus structural genes that self-assemble into particles resembling native adenovirus. We will characterize and evaluate immunogenicity (sera-neutralization) of the AdVLP vaccines and establish stable transfected cell lines for continuous vaccine production. This technology is suitable for multivalent vaccine formulation and rapid upgrade with new adenovirus serotypes. Creating an AdVLP system for multivalent vaccine manufacturing in mammalian cells offers a suitable and robust strategy for generating safe and highly effective adenovirus vaccines at a competitive cost."

The computational cost of contemporary CFD methods is hampered by excessive numerical dissipation of vorticity, and common methods fail to predict adequately the unsteady rotor and fuselage loading when engineering\/design level grids are employed. Continuum Dynamics, Inc. (CDI), Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, propose to directly address these limitations while simultaneously supporting ongoing and future Army rotorcraft development and support efforts by developing a suite of variable-fidelity wake prediction methods for improving CFD and enabling breakthrough full rotorcraft interactional aerodynamics modeling capabilities. The proposed approach builds upon work at CDI and GT in CFD, free-wake and hybrid analyses to dramatically reduce the computational cost of complete rotorcraft CFD by developing a robust and efficient overset coupling between DoD CFD\/CSD methods and variants of CDIs CHARM and VorTran-M2 solvers that is transparent to the end user. Phase I will see the proof-of-concept development and validation of such an approach, including capabilities assessment and demonstration in a real-world design environment."

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for an open air virtual partial alcove anechoic chamber to attenuate interference to and from electronic warfare (EW) systems for test ranges, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Electromagnetic Virtual Anechoic Chamber (EMVAC). It is based on interference suppression by an innovative mitigation technique and available antenna, receiver, and transmitter components to send out a canceling wave. Specifically, the innovation in the system architecture and its antenna network will enable the EMVAC to persistently reduce interference originating from EW systems under test and also from external commercial communication systems. This system offers test operators an interference reduction tool enabling physical testing of EW systems in a 500 m testing zone that covers a 15 degree sector both vertically and horizontally, without creating signal reflection. In addition, EMVAC is not affected by wind or temperature variation, and provides a modular solution that is quickly relocatable, which directly address the Army requirements. In Phase I, POC will perform tradeoff analysis and demonstrate the feasibility of EMVAC through simulation, design, and prototype testing of critical subsystems. In Phase II, POC plans to develop an EMVAC prototype to conduct live-testing to prove its mission worthiness."

        "abstract": "EW BDA is currently performed by Signals Intelligence because Electronic Warfare Officers (EWOs) lack the right tools to assess EW Operational effectiveness. New EW BDA tools are needed to: - Detect and baseline all signals, including commercial, military, and previously unknown signals; - Identify signal changes in real time with metrics; and - Operate within existing systems and SWAP (size, weight, and power) requirements. Ideally an EW BDA tool provides sufficient detection granularity so that an EWO could dial in a soft kill to minimize power on target and maximize total targets attacked. Unfortunately, assessing subtle changes in signals is hard, and making those assessments on never-before-seen signals is exponentially harder, especially with the restricted processing currently fielded. To fill this gap, TeraSys will create the TeraICE EW Spectrum Sensor (TESS), which will combine our thorough understanding of EW ground platforms with our CERDEC-funded research in DSP-based signal processing. This new technology will assess subtle signal changes in known and unknown signals to provide clear EW BDA signal-kill metrics."

We will demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating this system as radiant-floor heating technology for expeditionary shelters. The new radiant-heating system has an accordion-style planar sheet structure, powered by a three-phase AC input and operated by a control panel for perceived temperature. It will have a rapid turn-on speed, stable uniform heating temperature, and divided heating zones that significantly improve energy efficiency and thermal comfort. It will be made water-proof by hermetic sealing, electrically safe with UL certification, tough and puncture resistant, super light (&lt; 200 lbs.) and easy to deploy and install by two soldiers, to meet all the requirements as specified in US Army Topic A15-066. It is made with interchangeable components for easy repair and maintenance. The Nanoxene radiant-heating system is readily scalable for system integration and mass production. In Phase II, a full-scale prototype will be built and tested in conjunction with a multi-channel control panel based on the numerical evaluation of perceived temperature. An accurate evaluation and optimal control of perceived temperature will be achieved and operated by a user-friendly interface."

Under the Modular Appliances for Configurable Kitchens (MACK) program, modular appliances for cooking, sanitation, and serving are being developed. This SBIR topic addresses the need for a modular refrigerator to provide refrigerated food storage within a kitchen configuration using modular appliances. The design approach that we are proposing uses super insulation on all of the wall areas to minimize wall conduction heat leak through minimum thickness walls, maximizing the useable interior volume. The refrigeration system will use a microchannel evaporator and condenser, minimizing the temperature lift of the refrigeration system. A small variable speed and capacity refrigerant compressor will be used, minimizing on-off cycling losses and the heat rejection load on the condenser, while having extra capacity for cool-down. In Phase I, an engineering model prototype modular refrigerator will be designed, built, and tested. In Phase II, several prototype modular refrigerators will be built and delivered."

We propose the hexon protein as the target antigen as it is considered the primary target for neutralizing antibodies generated against adenovirus, and protection from adenovirus disease is associated with the presence of serotype specific serum neutralizing antibodies. The use of recombinant baculovirus to express foreign proteins in insect cells has been well characterized, and has matured into a commercial manufacturing technology. This technology will allow rapid incorporation of additional serotypes if the need arises. The fundamental high level objective of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of expression and purification of the hexon proteins based on the BEVS and insect cell platform technology, and to provide preliminary stability assessment on the candidate product. The resulting proof-of-concept data should support the future objectives in Phase II for pilot scale process development, immunogenicity studies in small animals, toxicology study, and other preparation activities related to filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA for Phase I clinical trial."

In IA, radio terminals with multiple antennas co-optimize, or align their transmitter and receiver antennas within a group (or cluster) of users, to suppress or eliminate interference within the cluster. We propose a unique slotted MAC structure that uses Zadoff-Chu sequences to distinguish user transmissions during the alignment. Users are able to simultaneously update their antennas weights, avoiding inefficient contention-based mechanisms to assign slots. We use a unique antenna algorithm, the Minimum Interference Leakage Beamformer (MIL-B) as our starting point. Simulations show MIL-B gives an amazing 4x gain over a standard MIMO system sending to one user at a time (TDMA). Our MAC design is fully distributed, yet is able to incorporate mechanisms for user selection, fairness, and synchronization."

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a methodology and supporting tools for assessing and estimating multidimensional fidelity requirements for target and background scenes used in M&amp;S to obtain smart munitions system performance. The overall effort in Phase I will focus on the development of a proof-of-concept demonstration that involves integrating fidelity metrics, development of test imagery, performance assessment, correlation of simulation performance with metrics, and the development of a suitability score for one sensor\/algorithm case. In addition, we will develop methods for specifying scene generation fidelity requirements based on classes of sensors\/algorithms, applications, and simulation type (all digital, signal injection, HWIL). We strongly believe that success in solving this critical problem will rely on a heuristic approach with significant input from our subject matter experts. Our goal for the proposed effort is to develop and demonstrate a proof-of-concept methodology in Phase I that can lead to a generalized fidelity formulation in Phase II. The generalized fidelity formulation will allow the simulation community to determine the adequacy and suitability of scene generator imagery for their specific simulation implementation and application, including testing simple to complex seekers and sensors in various simulation environments."

To meet the need for improved sensor systems that perform well in degraded visibility environmental conditions Optonicus proposes to develop a fiber-array illuminator multi-sensor all weather tracker (FAST) which includes an active (gated array) imaging system combined with a dual band\/dual color passive infrared imager. The gated imaging system will use a fiber-array laser beam projector for incoherent illumination of a target to reduce speckle effects and increase tracking performance. A passive dual band\/color infrared camera is part of the system and will provide images in two spectral ranges within the MWIR\/LWIR wavebands with total temporal and spatial correlation. Image processing algorithms will be developed that make use of the advanced features of these passive cameras. The FAST system will work in tandem with a conventional radar system and provide identification and fine tracking of targets to the aimpoint a HEL weapons system."

        "abstract": "Developing a safe and effective HIV vaccine remains the hope for controlling the global AIDS epidemic. Since HIV enters the body at mucosal surfaces, induction of immune response at these sites will be necessary as preventive approaches. Nasal administration has been shown to be the most effective route for mucosal immunization among others, and it can stimulate the immune responses locally and distantly. However, the pure recombinant or synthetic antigens used in HIV vaccines is less immunogenic, therefore, there are major needs for the new HIV antigen delivery platforms to enhance these immunogenicity. Luna proposes to develop a needle free carbon nanotube HIV vaccine (CNTVac) delivery platform that is capable of delivering a broad range of vaccines (antigens) mucosally (by intranasal delivery) to prevent HIV infections. The CNT has been demonstrated that it can uptake into mucosal cell rapidly, less cytotoxicity and stimulate the mucosal immune responses. In Phase I Luna will synthesize and modify the CNT to achieve the best delivery platform for vaccine antigens, and enhance mucosal immune responses with low cytotoxicity. In Phase II Luna will develop CNT vaccine formulation for animal efficacy, safety studies in preparation for filing an IND to prevent HIV infections."

        "abstract": "Infrared imaging has revolutionized the Armys approach to warfare, providing the capability to see  day or night  through smoke, fog, and dust. Imaging in all battlefield conditions enables 24-hour covert targeting and tracking, threat warning, hostile fire identification; thereby increasing mission capability while providing protection for the troops. For high-resolution imaging in all conditions, the Army utilizes electro-optic\/infrared (EO\/IR) focal plane arrays that cover the VISIBLE to LWIR spectral range. For suppression of problematic reflections from the high index sensor surfaces, thin film antireflection coatings are employed. The Army has identified that these coatings do not adequately suppress reflections to mission specifications and often have environmental durability issues related to stress and thermal fluctuations. An innovative and rugged and solution to the AR problem is based on surface relief AntiReflective Microstructures (ARMs) imparted directly in the sensor substrate material through a simple plasma deposition, etch, and cleaning process. With no dissimilar materials as a component of the AR treatment, stress and environmental durability issues are eliminated. The optical performance of microstructures has been shown to be far superior to thin film coatings with respect to reflection suppression, transmission bandwidth, and off-axis performance. The combination of large batch processing, short cycle times, and in-situ process controls result in an ARMs manufacturing process that will produce the low unit costs required to equip the warfighter in the field."

        "abstract": "Composite and metallic airframe structures are susceptible to different damage types. Fatigue cracks are the major damage concerns for metallic airframe structures where as impact induced delamination and debond are major concerns for composite airframe structures. However, once damage is initiated, it can grow extremely fast and can lead to catastrophic failure of the structure. Hence, it is very important to develop Health Conscious Structures (HCS) using advanced Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems that are capable of detecting damage precursors at an earlier stage than currently possible as well as reliable prognostic tools to accurately predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the structure. Acellent technologies in collaboration with the University of South Carolina and Bell Helicopters proposes to develop a novel and advanced multi-sensor based SHM system that will detect damage precursors, monitor damage progression and accurately predict the remaining useful life of the structure in near real-time. The proposed approach will be applicable for both metal and composite structures. The proposed system will be tested and demonstrated with metallic coupons in Phase-I of this project whereas composite coupons will be tested as part of Phase-II of this project."

        "abstract": "There is a critical need for replacement of viscose processed rayon-based carbon fibers for use in Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) nozzle designs. Rayon based fibers have unique thermal-structural properties which makes them an excellent ablative material in nozzle liners; but, due to undesirable processing conditions, there is no longer a domestic commercial supplier of these fibers. This proposal presents an opportunity to develop a PAN-based fiber that has been specifically processed (doped, spun, stabilized, and carbonized) to achieve the required ablative properties need for SRM nozzles. The approach will offer drop-in processing with existing acrylic precursor and conversion for minimal retrofitting of current fiber production. The carbon fiber will possess three key characteristics (1) low thermal conductivity for insulation, (2) crenulated fiber shapes for interlaminar strength, and (3) sustainability by using PAN based precursor. To accelerate the transition of this technology, the program will utilize a 100 foot pilot spin line, housed at the University of Kentucky  Center for Applied Energy Research, for producing of meaningful research quantities of precursor tow (up to 1 lb\/working day) and generating near full-scale fiber spinning procedures at commercial fiber plants."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Commercial off the shelf (COTS) electronic components have long been used by many companies in a wide range of industries to assist in their day to day operations. Most companies today use COTS computer workstations, servers, and networking devices in one form or fashion. While cost effective, COTS components are not required to adhere to strict Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) standards. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) has been shown to affect the operation of essential electronic components such as the Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) of an Integrated Circuit (IC) chip. As of today, there isn&apos;t a device that has been designed to be used specifically for COTS to identify EMI events and perform a thorough diagnostics on the state of a COTS component. This type of device could be beneficial in many organizations that need to be cost efficient but still require a stable and reliable COTS. The Department of Defense could stand to benefit from this type of device as it would cost efficiently provide a mechanism to quickly identify potential issues with its COTS components.; BENEFIT: The Department of Defense could stand to benefit from such a device because their PC&apos;s, servers, and routers need to guarantee reliability and quick turnaround time in the event that an EMI event may have caused damage to their equipment. In this scenario a more cost effective solution is needed than having customized hardware for every personnel and equipment within the organization. Using a COTS component would be ideal in the way of cost savings; however COTS components are not created with the requirement of exposure to harsh environments with high levels of Electromagnetic Interference. As such, a system or device that is designed to work with COTS could benefit the DoD greatly. Companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, Rackspace, and Intel utilize hundreds of thousands of web servers to support their customer base [18]. It would be very costly for these companies to create custom hardware specifically designed to diagnose EMI events when the majority of their business does not have a requirement to rely on this functionality."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Dayton T. Brown Inc. (DTB) and Fatigue Technology Inc. (FTI) propose the collaborative development of an all-platform standardized bushing system for AF Landing Gears (LGs). In order to minimize or eliminate the problems associated with traditional bushing installation methods, the use specially-engineered variant(s) of FTIs ForceMate system is proposed. Accelerated simultaneous testing of current and proposed configurations will be performed in a specially designed chamber that makes possible the concurrent application of mechanical and environmental stresses. Using such advanced test concepts, optimized protocols (including CPCs, sealants, paints and finishes) for bushing installation will be developed based on a comprehensive set of quantitative test data, post-test failure analysis and an extensive suite of variants including the potential use of ultrasonics during installation.; BENEFIT: The adaptations and refinements that will emerge from the successful completion of Phase I and then Phase II will further enhance the acceptance of this high interference bushing installation process, especially in the next generation of high strength landing gear materials which will make it a very attractive proposition. We will use the refinements gained to seek out applications in the current and next generation of commercial aircraft and high performance helicopters in landing gear as well as other diverse primary structural locations and use its established international market recognition to fully realize the commercial market place and capitalize on these latest refinements."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: CuBe alloy is the material of choice for highly wear resistant, high strength bushing material utilized frequently in landing gear applications. However, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists beryllium (Be) as hazardous with inhalation of Be-containing particulate leading to inflammation of the lungs and chronic beryllium disease and lesion development in the lungs with long-term exposure. Thus, the objective of this project is to research and qualify substitutes for CuBe material in high load landing gear applications. As an alternative to the CuBe alloy, we propose development of Cu based binary and ternary alloys without Be. The alloy compositions will be determined from analysis and calculations of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase diagrams using a combination of computer coupling of phase diagrams and thermochemistry as well as limited experimental data available in the open literature. Selected alloys will be fabricated and tested for mechanical and tribological properties. Sub-scale bushing tests will be conducted on selected alloys.; BENEFIT: The new environmentally friendly Cu based alloys developed in this project will replace hazardous CuBe alloy for high load landing gear applications for military airplanes. It is expected that materials proven through this effort will also be suited to commercial landing gear applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The existing antenna used for telemetry application has 50% antenna efficiency and large aperture size. Aurora is going to propose to design a new antenna with a smaller form factor and keep a good level of antenna efficiency by the proposed technologies. During the Phase I Program, Aurora will design and fabricate an antenna prototype using the proposed technology.  Testing and manufacturing principals for the proposed improvement solutions will be developed as part of the Phase I Program.  We will review the antenna performance based on the link budget of the customer system and adjust the design strategy based on performance impacts. A software testbed will be designed in phase I to simulate and compare the performance of collected data from numerical simulation and lab measurement. Recurring labor and qualitative manufacturing data will be collected during manufacture of the prototype which will be used to evaluate cost and developed manufacturing processes.  Based on test and fabrication results, the antenna system design and manufacturing principals will be revised in preparation for the fabrication of a large-scale article during the Phase II Program.BENEFIT:Successful completion of this program will result in developing and commercializing miniaturized, efficient, directional, and wideband antennas for the future wireless systems. The 4G advanced\/5G wireless network will be the next-generation wireless communications mainstream. The proposed antenna design can be used for microwave backhaul and provide high speed transmission and low-profile installation due to its high efficiency and small form factor.     Examples of other military programs that can benefit from this technology include the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, foliage and ground penetration radars, the Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS), SIGINT radio, and SATCOM etc. If technically the project is successful, we will approach large, established companies in this market segment with the goal of licensing our technology and possible collaboration for their R&amp;D efforts."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  During the Phase I Program, Aurora will perform a conceptual-level design of an air-launched sensor platform featuring integrated antennas, with the goal of maximizing range and endurance thanks to the improved aerodynamic qualities.  The technology is expected to replace many traditional antenna installations on military UAVs, and then find applications in the commercial world, including uses unrelated to air vehicles. The problem of antenna integration is tightly coupled with that of structural layout and overall vehicle configuration; the Aurora\/Resonant Sciences team will work in parallel to identify preferred solutions and demonstrate the feasibility of the concept.  Based on the findings of the study, one antenna concept will be selected and a sample part built to start assessing the manufacturing aspects of the technology. The proposed Phase I program will pave the way for a detailed structural design, antenna breadboard testing, and the demonstration of an adaptive wing actuation under load in a wind tunnel in Phase II.    BENEFIT:  The need for structurally embedded antennas is primarily being driven by the U.S. defense industry for future aircraft development programs. The technology developed as a result of this program would find applications in both military and commercial aircraft applications.  Aurora will work to develop this technology and transition any processes or techniques developed during the course of this program to the military and commercial sectors. Application of this technology to Department of Defense programs will allow a cleaner aerodynamic design, longer range and endurance, as well as better sensor coverage, and provide the airframe designer with increased design possibilities.  Aurora will market the design and manufacturing techniques developed during this program as a tool in the acquisition and development of new aircraft programs in both the military and commercial sectors.   It is expected that the early market will include Department of Defense contractors and specifically programs focused on the development of advanced composite aircraft structures."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  ASTS, along with our Aerojet Rocketdyne commercialization partner, are pleased to present this proposed project to demonstrate feasibility of using specialized computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools for predicting the behavior of flow interactions in a modular aerospike rocket engine.  Our project will examine the flowfield between adjacent thrusters, which we will use to predict the associated performance losses.  We will then examine how those perturbations grow or attenuate downstream and, in particular, how they affect base flow, arguably the most important--and most difficult to predict--component of thrust of a zero-length modular aerospike engine.  Our commercialization plan is sound, complete, and already underway.  Our team is currently negotiating a contract with the Missile Defense Agency wherein we will begin development of a modular aerospike for a missile defense application.  The project proposed herein will enable us to more quickly develop and qualify the modular thruster modules, which will, in turn, allow us to proceed to flight far more quickly.  BENEFIT:  Aerospike engine performance predictions, flow interactions, and heat loads are notoriously difficult, particularly for a modular aerospike design.  Our projet will begin to elucidate the complicated compressible fluid physics interactions that can have a dramatic effect on overall engine performance.  Importantly, because of the investment already being made by MDA, the Air Force will more quickly, and less expensively, reap a return on its investment by enabling us to more quickly proceed through development and to flight."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Karagozian &amp; Cases team proposes to develop a predictive toolkit for the mechanical and physicochemical behaviors of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) up to failure, especially for extreme thermo-mechanical loadings. The toolkit will consist of a constitutive model, computer software, and material model parameters. The proposed CMC model will be based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes with internal state variables approach and will account for the inelastic, damage and fracture behaviors as well as the degradation and healing scenarios induced in CMCs in high temperatures. The mechanical part of the CMC model will lend itself into an ABAQUS\/STANDARD user material Software based on a local loop made of nested fixed-point and NewtonRaphson iterations, while its physicochemical part will be implemented into MATLAB software using a mixed analytical\/numerical formulation. A link will be established between both implementations. The CMC model parameters will be determined for a self-healing SiC\/SiC CMC developed by the SAFRAN Group and other CMCs that may be of interest to the U.S. Air Force. Several examples, including the prediction of the service life and the understanding of self-healing mechanisms, will be used to validate the CMC model.  BENEFIT:  The outcome of this proposal is the development of a robust ABAQUS\/STANDARD user material (UMAT) software to predict the inelastic, damage and fracture behaviors as well as the healing\/degradation mechanisms of CMC materials and structures, especially in extreme thermo-mechanical environments. We will also provide a set of CMC material model parameters for the self-healing SiC\/SiC CMC, developed by the SAFRAN Group and other CMCs of interest to the U.S. Air Force."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Florida Turbine Technologies, Inc. (FTT), a small business located in Jupiter, Florida proposes the subject program to enable physics-based tools to be made more robust such that they can be used with confidence during the design process. With this program, FTT and AeroDynamic Solutions, Inc. (ADS) will cooperate to integrate conjugate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and heat transfer methods with rapid, low-cost experimental methods to permit Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) results to be validated quickly and with high accuracy. During Phase I, FTT will define current and advanced cooling technologies based on FTT intellectual property and\/or other technology sources such as U.S. and foreign patent agencies. FTT will construct models of these geometries and perform baseline internal flow and pressure loss testing. ADS will perform CHT analyses of these configurations. Thermal performance will be determined based on the CHT results and will be compared with the results obtained from conventional prediction methods. Finally, a survey of low-cost, high quality test techniques needed to provide critical validation data will be performed and plans will be developed to implement these into component and rig tests in a follow-on Phase II SBIR program.  BENEFIT:  With the successful completion of Phases I &amp; II of this program, FTT and ADS expect to offer a superior CHT analysis capability that is robust and gives increased accuracy and confidence of thermal predictions. With this, cooled turbine components can be designed with reduced cooling flow to improve overall engine performance while maintaining or improving durability. The technology is directly translatable from the military gas turbine design sector to commercial sector of jet engine designs for aircraft and to industrial gas turbine engines."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Busek proposes to develop an ultra compact CubeSat propulsion system utilizing non-toxic, green monopropellant.  The system will occupy 1\/2U volume and the tuna can protrusion space made available by a 3U CubeSat launchers ejector spring.  Key components of this concept include an innovative micro thruster based on Buseks groundbreaking monopropellant catalyst technology, a material-compatible propellant tank, and a highly miniaturized feed system.  The proposed system will provide total impulse on the order of 580N-sec, which will give a 3U\/4kg CubeSat approximately 150m\/s of delta-V maneuverability.  The thruster and the feed system are expected to require less than 10W power to operate.  Phase I will focus on risk reduction efforts by developing critical components such as the micro thruster and the high-capacity tank.  Phase II will focus on advancing the system design and complete hardware development, which will include full characterization and life testing of the micro thruster.  BENEFIT:  A 1\/2U green monopropellant system with high total impulse (&gt;500N-sec) is unique within the industry and of significant interest to DoD, civil, and commercial customers alike.  In the CubeSat propulsion world, the proposed micro thruster has a niche as it can provide smooth and steady thrust, whereas other similar systems on the market may be too powerful for CubeSats to steer.  Current CubeSats situated in LEO have useful life anywhere between 3 and 6 months; using the proposed propulsion system for drag makeup can potentially extend mission life to well beyond 12 months.  Prolonged life of assets in orbit will significantly alter the economics of any space-centric entity, whether public or private.  The non-toxic nature of the propellant further reduces CubeSat costs associated with development, integration and launch preparation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposed SBIR will demonstrate the feasibility of delivering a revolutionary integrated inspection station for engine airfoils that uses the same advanced eddy current technology (called the JENTEK MWM-Array) to provide BOTH reliable crack detection and dimensional analysis for chord width and tip wear. By utilizing the same flexible and easily adaptable sensing technology, a low cost, and reconfigurable inspection station will be demonstrated with extremely rapid inspection capabilities. This solution will enable rapid tool changing with easily interchangeable part holding and integrated scanning kits for each of the 143 part numbers that require inspection. It will also provide dramatically improved inspection speeds compared to conventional eddy current methods, enabling the required inspection of 190,000 parts per year.  The Phase I will develop the 3-D dimensioning capability and demonstrate an integrated crack detection and dimensional measurement capability on two blade geometries. Phase I will also demonstrate the feasibility of addressing the large number of Air Force part numbers with an innovative automated inspection station design concept. Furthermore, crack depth measurement capability, already in use by the Navy to qualify blades for repair, will be incorporated to trigger repair actions, and eventually to qualify repairs as well.    BENEFIT:  It is anticipated that many Air Force and Navy legacy propulsion systems would benefit from the engine airfoil integrated inspection stations to be developed under this proposed program. The technology will be demonstrated to the Air Force, Navy, and DoD suppliers to solicit interest, funding, and system purchases for production, and depot, and field use. Rolls Royce and other engine OEMs, as well as PAS and other blade maintenance and repair providers have expressed strong interest in a rapid inspection system for blades and capability to reliably provide dimensioning, defect detection and sizing and repair qualification capabilities."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  LaunchPoint Technologies proposes to develop a motor drive (alternator controller) for hybrid and electric small unmanned aircraft that fills the gap between cheap flightweight remote control hobby products and full-featured but heavy industrial products.  The motor drive system will be modular to allow the inclusion\/exclusion of hardware features as-needed for a particular application to keep the system mass to an absolute minimum; and allow scalabilty to higher\/lower power levels with common hardware.    Power modules ranging from 500 W to 40 kW and up are envisioned.  I\/O modules will support a variety of feedback sensors and communications protocols.  The processor module will have sufficient processing power for advanced Field Oriented sensorless Control algorithms.  Processor modules with different popular microcontrollers and a dual-rendundant processor module are planned.  The software will be open-source and reconfigurable with readily available (freeware) tools allowing researchers to fine tune the internal control loops and system behaviors to match their vehicles specific needs.    The entire system will be developed with the ability to meet airworthiness requirements and be flight certified in the future as a part of LaunchPoint Technologies Propulsion By Wire hybrid-electric aircraft architecture.    BENEFIT:  The immediate commercial applications for the modular, configurable motor drive are researchers developing unique unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) who require customized motor drive configurations for high performance applications and new architectures that cant be met with existing hobby or industrial equipment.  The modular nature of the proposed motor drive will lend itself to scalable development projects that start as small demonstrators and move up to large hybrid\/electric aircraft.  The proposed motor drive can also be configured as an alternator controller for hybrid-electric vehicles for which there are presently few off-the-shelf solutions available.  As the small UAV market matures there will be a substantial commercial market for the proposed high quality motor drives designed with reliability and safety in mind.  Future hybrid\/electric UAVs for use over people and manned hybrid\/electric aircraft will likely require flight certified motor drive hardware and software that will result from continued development of the modular motor drive proposed here."

This system can easily be applied to developers of other unmanned systems as well as other industries where developers can focus on the system level control design and leverage the advanced motor control capabilities built into the FlexMC. The hardware system consists of a control processor board, interchangeable power stages (0.5 to 30kW), and an expansion module for system specific needs.  The flexible software platform can be programmed or modified at three distinct levels, depending on end users preference, skills, and level of customization required:  Embedded C-code, Matlab \/ Simulink with auto-generated C-code capability and GUI interface (base control algorithm is pre-programmed  user has the ability to change motor, PID, and velocity profile parameters, among others. The key benefits are reduced risk, reduced development time, and technology advancement by allowing systems developers to focus on higher level system challenges.  BENEFIT:  Benefits:  - Advancement in propulsion control systems for UAVs  - Reduced development risk through model based time  - Reduce development time and cost  Commercialization  - UAV systems as well as ground and air unmanned systems  - Ruggedized industrial drive systems that need to meet future efficiency standards"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A research effort to investigate innovative approaches to rapid and simple variation of bleed patterns in high-speed inlet wind tunnel models is proposed.  Variation of inlet bleed patterns in high-speed wind tunnel models are typically implemented by selectively filling or opening holes in plates that incorporate large arrays of bleed holes.  Holes are filled with plaster or other substances, which can be labor-intensive and require significant facility down-time to accomplish.  The proposed effort will identify new approaches to vary inlet bleed pattern.  Innovative hole-filling materials will be investigated, with the goal of ease of application and short cure times.  The use of additive-manufacturing techniques to fabricate easily-installed bleed surfaces is also proposed.  Finally, mechanically-actuated parametric bleed variation concepts will be developed.  The objective will be to identify a system that will allow remotely-variable actuation of the bleed pattern, while introducing minimal additional complexity to the test hardware.  Following a review with AFRL, one or more approaches will be selected for further development in a Phase II effort, and conceptual design approaches to implementing the chosen concepts in a selected research model and wind tunnel test facility will be developed.  BENEFIT:  Because development of an effective bleed system is critical to the design of a viable high-speed inlet system, the ability to test multiple bleed patterns and configurations in an experimental research program is essential.  As the cost of wind tunnel testing continues to rise, the potential benefits of reducing test facility occupancy time are becoming increasingly significant.  In the past, varying inlet model bleed patterns has been time-consuming, since the state-of-the-art has been selective filling and\/or opening of individual holes to change the bleed pattern.  This approach typically requires facility down-time to make the change, and to allow for the filler material to cure.  The development of rapid, simple approaches to bleed pattern alterations, while allowing variation and measurement of the amount of flow removed, will enhance the inlet technologists ability to develop an effective bleed system while reducing the time and cost of experimental research and development.  The proposed technology will be useful to government agencies performing aerodynamic research on supersonic and hypersonic airbreathing propulsion systems (such as the Air Force, Navy, and NASA), as well as to U.S. aerospace companies developing high-speed aircraft for military and commercial use."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Hypersonic flight conditions subject the vehicle to extreme environments that induce severe thermal gradients and generate intense spatial and time varying pressures. Existing methodologies for analyzing the high-performance materials required to operate in these environments are typically linear elastic solutions that do not capture the highly non-linear response and failure progression seen from these materials. ATA Engineering proposes development of a material modeling toolset, implemented as an add-on to commercial CAE software,  that will determine material performance parameters (e.g., strength, stiffness) under complex thermomechanical loading. The toolset will combine an efficient means for finite element modeling of ceramic matrix composites, advanced regression algorithms to determine constituent material properties from limited test data, and progressive-failure Monte Carlo simulation in an intuitive user interface.  The toolset will include a means for multiscale analysis that will communicate information about local material damage to and from a full vehicle simulation. In Phase I, we will develop analytic models representative of materials used on previous high speed vehicles and validate their predictive accuracy against existing material test data. In Phase II, we will perform a experimental campaign for verification and validation and will incorporate the tool into a comprehensive multiphysics simulation framework for hypersonic vehicles.  BENEFIT:  The technologies developed in this project will aid the design of the next generation of hypersonic vehicles by reducing risk and uncertainty. The toolset will allow designers to incorporate progressive material failure models with structural, aerodynamic, thermal, and other physical models to provide a more holistic and accurate understanding of vehicle state-of-structure throughout the mission trajectory. Through a multi-scale approach, the analytic tool will allow investigation of local material damage progression in the context of a full vehicle simulation without greatly increasing solution time . Commercial applications extend beyond hypersonic vehicles to gas turbine engine components, spacecraft reentry systems, automotive and other systems utilizing advanced composite materials."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The success of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has prompted rapid expansion of their capabilities and duties.  The sensors and equipment that enable their activities require significant electric power, which can be provided by an auxiliary power unit (APU) that operates independently from the main engine.  Conventional APUs are relatively heavy and inefficient for common high-altitude UAS missions because they use ambient air for their working fluid, which has low density at high altitudes.  In response, we propose to develop a gas-turbine APU that has a closed-loop configuration with a dense working fluid to make it extremely compact and lightweight.  Our team is well suited to succeed because we have a long history developing innovative thermodynamic systems, miniature turbomachines, compact heat exchangers, and advanced combustion systems for challenging applications.  During the Phase I project, we will optimize design trades, create a preliminary design, and conduct combustor tests.  We will then fabricate and test a prototype system during the Phase II project.  BENEFIT:  The proposed system will enhance electric power generation for military and civilian applications.  Low mass, compact size, and high efficiency make it ideal for aircraft, watercraft, land vehicles, and standalone mobile generators.  In addition, high reliability in harsh environments is extremely attractive for military, construction, remote scientific, and off-grid recreational uses."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this SBIR project, NexTech Materials will collaborate with Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) to design an SOFC based auxiliary power unit (APU) for unmanned aerial systems.  The APU will be based on NexTechs sulfur tolerant and power dense SOFC stack and PCIs sulfur tolerant JP-8 reforming technology.  In Phase I of the project, various system design options will be considered and process modeling will be performed on a 2-kW scale, JP-8 fueled SOFC system with minimum 25 percent fuel efficiency.  In addition, 3D CAD modeling will be performed to maximize the system gravimetric power density, with a minimum of 100 W\/kg being targeted.  In Phase II, NexTech will advance the design and build, test, and demonstrate the key features of the APU via breadboard testing.  Successful execution of this project will result in a substantial advancement in the performance and capability of unmanned aerial systems of interest to the Air Force and other U.S. military branches.  BENEFIT:  Unmanned aerial systems are being used in ever expanding types of missions, and with a concomitant need for increased payloads, the weight and power draws lead to reduced endurance.  This drives the need for power dense and high efficiency auxiliary power units to support non-flight critical on-board electrical power needs.  The proposed SOFC-based APU technology is specifically geared toward the requirements of unmanned aerial systems.  However, there are a number of other military power applications that would benefit from the JP-8 fueled SOFC system technology.  These include unmanned ground systems, auxiliary power units for military ground vehicles and silent watch missions, battery chargers, tent city heat and power systems, and runway lighting."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To address the need for automated infrastructure damage assessment, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Sensor-based Multimodal Automated Reasoning Technology (SMART). The proposed solution is based on multimodal sensing, wireless data transmission and networking, and automated damage feature extraction and reasoning. Specifically, the innovation in use of novel low-profile thin piezoelectric-wafer active sensors, novel integration of POCs proprietary low-power and small-form-factor WUMSS wireless technology, and new development of unique fuzzy logic algorithms will enable detection of multiple types of damage, networked wireless damage monitoring, automated damage feature extraction, and automatic assessment of infrastructure integrity, taking into account metadata. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the SMART approach by building a laboratory prototype and specifying performance thresholds for an experimental demonstration of feasibility in several possible scenarios. In Phase II, we will develop an engineering prototype and demonstrate its performance under real-case scenarios. The Phase II prototype will be demonstrated to agree within 50 percent of human-generated values. The Phase II SMART system prototype will reach technology readiness level (TRL) 5 to -6 and be ready for initial testing for potential transition to Air Force acquisition programs.BENEFIT:Successful development of the SMART technology will find broad applications in both the military and commercial sectors. The SMART system can be used by the military to assess damage and monitor the health of military infrastructure such as buildings and airport pavement. Through minor modification, the system can be used for health monitoring of military aircraft structures. The SMART system can also be used by other government agencies for damage assessment and health monitoring of government infrastructure such as public buildings, pavement, and bridges. It can also be used by First Responders to evaluate the damage of structures after catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks. The SMART sensors can be built into civilian building structures to realize health monitoring and damage assessment for more effective maintenance. Since the SMART sensors can also be used for damage detection of composite and metal structures, they can be modified for damage detection of aircraft structures and components. For such applications, Boeing has expressed their interest in this technology and will have more involvement in the Phase II development including transition of the SMART technology to their military platforms."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Current battle damage assessments for post energetic events are often reliant on subjective observations and can take time to gather a complete picture of the damage and the remaining useful life of the tactical structure.  TRI\/Austin proposes to develop an automated damage assessment toolkit that can reduce analysis time and provide a clearer projection of the remaining usefulness of the structure. TRI\/Austin will use a two phase approach, beginning with advanced areal stereophotogrammetric analysis of the damage and then followed by emplacement of fiber optic sensor networks to provide real time, long term monitoring capabilities.  Data gathered by stereophotogrammetry will be combined with blast analysis models to generate a predictive estimate of the remaining potential life. Embedded sensors will monitor the structure as repairs are completed and can provide continuous monitoring after repairs are completed. TRI\/Austin will use its experience in data fusion to create a final product that can be shared across military tactical command and control systems for complete situational awareness., giving commanders a greater understanding of the capabilities of the tactical infrastructure.BENEFIT:TRI\/Austin will develop an automated damage assessment tool kit to determine the level of damage in buildings and tactical structures and predict remaining useful life. The initial assessment analysis will utilize stereophotogrammetry to create fast objective measurements. Embedded sensors will provide real time monitoring of the structure and can be left in place once repairs are complete in order to provide future monitoring of events that might affect the health of the structure.  Data fusion techniques will merge all of the data into a coherent picture to provide a concise prediction of the remaining life of the structure. The system can also be applied to infrastructure in non combatant areas such as bridges or oil pipe lines where geography can make inspections and monitoring a difficult endeavor."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To ensure the United States remains safe from the threat of nuclear and radiological attacks requires advanced radiation detection with the ability to quickly and accurately detect illicit nuclear materials including dirty bombs and other dangerous radioisotopes. Existing nuclear radiation systems are still heavily based on technologies developed decades ago. These old technologies have either inadequate performance or require cryogenic cooling. Although research in recent years has led to some newer classes of room temperature semiconductor detectors, none of these newer materials can simultaneously satisfy all three critically important features for a practical, advanced room temperature radiation sensor: high performance, low cost and stable operation. We propose a new class of rugged, portable, low cost and very high performance gamma ray detectors based on mercurous bromide (Hg2Br2) that can potentially act as neutron detectors as well. We are the only company in the country currently capable of growing large crystals of Hg2Br2 and we have demonstrated initial encouraging detector response to both gamma and alpha particle incident radiation. Our goal is to deliver a breakthrough in detector technology that can address the limiting issues of current technologies.; BENEFIT: The objective of our proposed Phase I research is to demonstrate the feasibility of mercurous bromide (Hg2Br2) as a suitable material for a high performance, low cost, energy efficient and robust pager form device with dual gamma-neutron detection. The novel Hg2Br2-based detector has multiple advantages over existing technologies. It has similar gamma detection performance as HgI2 but with long term stability and larger detector volume. Ultimately, the plan is to continue the development where robustness and compactness of design will be top priority and the electronics will be extended to ASIC-based for practical dual gamma-neutron hand-held prototype device development for future manufacturing and commercialization. Hg2Br2-based radiation detectors are currently not available commercially at the present time while the need for a practically deployable alternative material to commercial off-the-shelf room temperature semiconductor materials has been of significant interests from the DOD, DHS, DOE, other Federal Agencies and even private sector such as Medical OEMs and Baggage Scanner OEMs (for TSA, X-Ray CT applications). We therefore will have very competitive advantage to be one of the first to provide a domestic source for this need."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Combustion instability (aka thermoacoustic instability) is a significant issue in propulsion systems including augmentors. Oscillations can increase heat transfer to walls 10 fold and cause vibration damage to the propulsion system and the surrounding system. This damage can occur very rapidly. Combustion instability (CI) is challenging to design for due to the complex interactions between the unsteady flow-field and combustion, as a result most systems are not able to be designed for stability. Instead, best practices and experience are used to minimize the risk, and when CI occurs in testing changes are attempted to fix the problem. These changes include damping systems such as liners and absorbers.  In this effort GTL proposes to demonstrate the ability to design damping systems by understanding the system instability. Here GTL will model the AFRL flameholder in order to determine the magnitude of the instability sources. This then quantifies how much damping energy is required. Damping methods can be modeled and judged against this criteria. From this recommendations for damping methods will be put forward.  This methodology can then be applied to augmentor systems in order to provide a damping method that is capable of performing at full scale. This will avoid issues where laboratory experiments do not scale. GTLs analysis method is also capable of identifying the sources of instability providing avenues for avoiding instability as opposed to damping. GTL has used its methods to model instabilities in scramjets, the J85 augmentor and many rocket systems. Validating GTLs methods leads to the more ideal design-for-stability process. Funding this effort would get us closer to that reality in augmentors.  BENEFIT:  Understanding combustion instability (CI) (aka thermoacoustic instability) would be a great benefit to propulsion system designers of all types. CI is a major technical risk in any new system development program. This effort acts to improve our understanding of damping systems and how they can be applied. In addition, this understanding also acts to uncover the causes of instability leading to methods that avoid the source of instability as opposed to damping it after the fact. GTL has used its models to analyze scramjets, augmentors and many rocket systems and seeks to further improve its ability to model augmentor instabilities and damping methods.  Eliminating instability as a design concern will significantly decrease development cost and risk. This will in turn allow engineers to produce more innovative designs without risk of instability. More efficient, lower cost, higher performing engines will be the result."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Afterburners operate under a wide range of operating conditions and hence they are likely to encounter conditions at which combustion (thermoacoustic) instabilities occur.  Therefore, methods to mitigate rumble and screech, usually classified as either active or passive control, are of clear interest. CSE, Inc. proposes to develop a strategy to design passive-control systems, in particular damping devices, to mitigate combustion instabilities in afterburners.  Passive-control methods for afterburners have been under development for more than half a century.  In spite of this plethora of passive-control devices and apparently good understanding of their basic physics, in particular for damping devices as highlighted above, the problem is that in practice passive control techniques tend to be applied on a (very) costly trial and error basis.  CSE, Inc. proposes to develop a strategy to design passive-control systems, in particular damping devices, to mitigate combustion instabilities in afterburners. This strategy is centered around an acoustic solver and is assisted by theory and CFD simulations. However, the present idea of using theory and CFD to assist acoustic-solver simulations in the time-domain can be applied to the design of any active- or passive-control method, and to any type of combustor.  BENEFIT:  Passive-control methods for afterburners are currently designed via a costly trial and error process. Thus, there is a need for computationally tractable, design-specific analyses that could reduce these costs and, as a result, make the development of new devices more attractive.  The obvious market for this software is the OEMs designing damping devices for afterburners.  However, due to the broad range of applicability of the proposed strategy, it is applicable to any passive-control method and to any type of combustor. This feature enhances the commercial success of the proposed approach by making it more appealing to a broader market, that includes the expanding gas-turbine industry."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In recent work for the Air Force, Ultramet demonstrated nearly one thousand restarts with repeatable pulse performance and steady-state burn characteristics using AF-M315E monopropellant and a novel ignition system. Based on the results of that project, Ultramet received a Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF) award from the Air Force to further develop the technology into a flightweight system, including qualification testing of a 22-N AF-M315E thruster by Moog-ISP to bring the technology to TRL 8. In the proposed project, Ultramet and Moog-ISP will leverage the previous and ongoing Air Force work to develop a 1-N AF-M315E-compatible cubesat monopropellant propulsion system design concept that utilizes an Ultramet chamber\/nozzle, and conduct a feasibility study on a cubesat-sized AF-M315E-compatible rim-rolling metallic diaphragm tank. Scaleability of the igniter technology will also be demonstrated at the 1-N level. Phase II will involve fabrication and hot-fire testing of a flight-like cubesat monopropellant propulsion system and bring the technology to TRL 8. Phase II teaming partners will include propulsion system integrator Moog-ISP, satellite integrator Ball Aerospace, and Aerospace Corporation for technical oversight.  BENEFIT:  The proposed technology will eliminate the catalyst degradation and washout issues plaguing AF-M315E catalysts, make hydrazine systems more robust, and\/or simplify ignition\/restart of non-hypergolic propellants. Potential applications will be numerous as it will enable use of advanced monopropellants that offer performance beyond that of monopropellant hydrazine and bipropellant NTO\/MMH. The ignition system can be used in attitude control and apogee engines for commercial and government satellites and divert and attitude control system engines for kinetic kill vehicles. The use of toxic propellants such as hydrazine will be eliminated in gas generators on military aircraft and fuel pressurization systems for tactical missiles. Because such a fast ramp rate and high ultimate temperature can be achieved, it may also be applicable to use in divert and attitude control systems for kinetic kill vehicles and other missile defense systems. Potential military, civil, and commercial space applications for the foam igniter system are orbit transfer, maneuvering, station keeping, and attitude control for satellites. Any agency with satellites employing hydrazine propulsion will benefit."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: EELV-class launches cost $100M-$300M, so there is enormous cost-saving to reduce the total number of launches needed for a constellation. In many cases solar arrays prohibit multiple spacecraft per launch. The performance of rigid panel arrays is not sufficient. Blanket arrays are the solution, as blankets have very light substrates and fold very compactly. UltraFlex and ROSA arrays offer near-term solutions, with increased metrics for packaging efficiency and mass, but each has limitations we believe can be surpassed by a new concept: The Compact Telescoping Array (CTA). A recently-published, government-funded design study has conceptualized and evaluated CTA based on existing technologies z-folded blankets deployed by a telescoping boom which promises high strength, high compaction, and ultra-light performance. Our assessment supports the potential to achieve breakthrough performance and cost savings, with a minimum of development cost and risk. This proposed SBIR activity will enable the maturation of this system capability to enable spacecraft multi-launch configurations and near-term mission infusion. It is our expectation that the completion of Phase II activity would culminate with the capability for a CTA to be proposed for the next GPS constellation and other flight missions, with the equivalent of near-TRL 6 (at the subsystem level). ; BENEFIT: Successful completion of the Phase I program will result in detailed design development and understanding of CTA performance for the GPS dual-launch application, a CTA demonstration model, and the comparative performance of UltraFlex for the same GPS requirements. The work will serve to ground and validate our recommendations for the best wing for a given application and will define the exact nature of required further development efforts for CTA. A Phase II program would focus on further advancing CTA technology and will include the prototyping of critical new subsystems at high fidelity, such as the top panel folding hinge among other areas requiring hardware development. Phase II tasks would likely include, 1) Detailed design of all subsystems and components from the Phase I models, 2) Additional finite element analysis on selected components and subsystems to determine optimal designs, 3) Manufacture of prototypes of selected subsystems and components to further reduce risk for the few areas of the design that lack significant flight heritage, 4) Manufacture of a scale model of a CTA wing, and 5) Preparation for manufacture and test of a full-scale CTA wing in post-Phase II. Angstrom Designs expects that after the Phase II effort CTA will be near or at TRL 6 and will be ready for adoption by a flight program. An alternate option would be to apply for advanced development funds and build a ground test technology demonstrator and\/or further advance the fidelity of critical subsystems of the CTA design in partnership with OAG. After Phase II, CTA will likely be ready for selection by a flight program. The promise of the design, the use of many flight heritage subsystems and components and a commercial partner, OAG, with significant experience in manufacturing and flying solar arrays, all enable rapid and low risk adoption of this promising new concept. Additionally, OAG is very enthusiastic about this technology. CTA would be an excellent complement to OAGs UltraFlex technology, which has a fixed, round aspect ratio. With a variable, rectangular aspect ratio and compact stowed form it could package into many situations where UltraFlex is not an ideal solution and perform as well as or better than UltraFlex for mass, stowed volume and cost. OAG recognizes the importance of diversifying their product line and sees CTA as an excellent option for mission scenarios where a high-performing rectangular blanket array is a better fit. Beyond the GPS mission, and constellation spacecraft in general, there is great interest in high-performance mid-range power solar arrays for many other applications. Orbital-ATKs civil, commercial, and defense customers and could all benefit from superior blanket array performance technology like UltraFlex and the particular advantages of promised from the CTA concept for a broad range of performance critical missions. The path to commercialization will be enabled by the broad market access provided by our partner OAG, who has significant interest in commercializing CTA technology. Post-Phase II commercialization would be in the form of sales directly from OAG. The entire space community is interested in high performance solar arrays. CTA offers great promise for mass efficiency, compact stowage, scalability to high power levels, and variability to fit different spacecraft busses and fairings. Benefits over the current state of practice will be most significant for large wings (5-10 kW), so early commercialization efforts will focus on the needs of larger satellites in higher orbits, such as MEO-orbit GPS satellites and GEO-orbit communications satellites. These applications are equally relevant for customers other than the Air Force, such as NASA and private, commercial prime contractors."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to determine the high-temperature properties of thermal protection system materials and structural materials utilized in the development, design, fabrication and testing of hypersonic vehicles. Test vehicle flights aimed at understanding the structural integrity of hypersonic demonstrators have been performed from about Mach 5 to 20, but these vehicles have not been recovered. The post-test forensics is difficult due to the lack of the high temperature properties of the thermal protection layer and the structural material strength. In order to properly design hypersonic test vehicles and the weapon systems that evolve from them, it is necessary to better understand the materials in their proper thermal environment. The goal of this proposed effort is to determine these high-temperature properties by a combination of experimental laser testing and modeling. PSI has achieved prior success in such evaluations using a well-characterized thermal source and matching as many experimental test results as possible as a function of the experiment time duration. In Phase I we will analyze prior test data for an innovative advanced material and determine a consistent material property data set. The Phase II effort will acquire new material property data for the hypersonic material database.  BENEFIT:  The acquisition of validated high-temperature properties for thermal protection materials and structural materials will lead to rapid improvements in the design, development and testing of new hypersonic weapon systems. The recommended hypersonic material database development will be of keen interest to the Air Force, DoD and DARPA as the development of hypersonic vehicles accelerates. NASA and commercial corporations will also find the database and the innovative material data acquisition process very useful as they develop hypersonic technology for earth and other planetary ventures."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  High speed weapons and platforms with velocities above Mach 4 will place significant demands on materials used for structures, aeroshells, apertures, control surfaces, and for propulsion components in air-breathing systems. The extremely harsh environment of flight above Mach 4 generates surface temperatures from 1000 degrees F to 3500 degrees F depending on the vehicle and the location on the vehicle. New innovative, affordable, light weight, high temperature capable, and thermally &amp; structurally efficient material concepts are required to enhance durability and carry some of the system loads without increasing parasitic weight and ultimately reducing the overall structural weight for future hypersonic platforms. Allcomp proposed to develop a new generation of CMC composites that are reinforced by multi-dimensional and tailorable fiber reinforcements. This new family of CMC composites are affordable, easy to fabricate and can be scale-up able for Aeroshell and Thermal Protection System (TPS) of the future hypersonic platforms.  BENEFIT:  This new generation of CMC composites are reinforced by multi-dimensional fiber preform that can be fabricated cost effectively with short lead time using any commercially available fiber. This new generation of CMC composites are affordable, light weight, high temperature capable. They can be engineered to meet specific thermal &amp; structural requirements of the Aeroshell and TPS of future hypersonic platforms. Once the production volume increases and the cost drops, there are also many space and commercial applications of using this family of CMC composites for applications such as high conductivity thermal doubler and furnace fixtures."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The PSI Team will develop highly innovative hypersonic vehicle ceramic matrix composite (CMC) structures to significantly advance the state-of-the-art aeroshells that meet the flight requirements of hypersonic vehicles currently under design. The PSI focus is to mature and demonstrate the technologies necessary to manufacture a fully integrated, structurally efficient loadbearing, cost competitive aeroshells. Z-pinning will be used during composite lay-up and cure to locally increase interlaminar strength and create fully integral stiffeners and sub-structure attachment points. Localized regions will have fully integrated, self-healing, compositionally graded, non-silicon containing protective oxide surfaces capable of withstanding higher temperatures than the silicon containing SiC matrices. Novel processing technology will form these tempered regions of the aeroshell that will operate with zero erosion at temperatures well above 3000oF. The PSI production process minimizes the use of process tooling and eliminates the expensive and time consuming machining of dense ceramics. The CMC technology will provide designers the ability to locally change vehicle geometry for higher temperature operation, leading to significant improvements in vehicle performance. This is an important aspect of the PSI approach as cost is a major vehicle design driver and a paramount discriminator amongst the OEMs.  BENEFIT:  Applications for low cost high temperature aeroshell materials include Department of Defense hypersonic boost-glide vehicles for reconnaissance or weapons systems as well as rocket based combined cycle (RBCC) vehicles for orbital access.  Successful development of a low cost manufacturing process for high temperature composite materials and large structures based on silicon carbide will also enable cost effective construction of silicon carbide heat exchangers for aggressive chemical processing and waste treatment.  Heat exchanger products offer the largest sustainable market opportunity of $25 million\/year."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force faces challenges related to selecting, maintaining and repairing coatings that protect and enhance the performance of critical components in gas turbine engines. Coatings must maintain performance despite experiencing several degrading mechanical, thermal and chemical impacts.  CFDRC proposes to develop a physics based model of the reactive flow environment integrated with a material damage model of the multilayered coating and substrate, with the intent to increase our understanding of the environmental impacts imparted onto the coating and the degradation in performance as a response. In phase I, we will develop a reacting computational fluid dynamics based model for the exhaust environment. We will integrate a quasi-continuum materials model to predict damage due to thermal-mechanical stress imparted on the coating and substrate based on the cohesive zone finite element method (CZM). CZM is appropriate for modeling fracture in multi-layered systems, which includes, cohesive and adhesive failures leading to spallation and delamination. In follow on work the models will be adapted to specific coating technologies and expanded to include the thermal mechanical stress imposed by soot accumulation and particle impacts.  BENEFIT:  CFDRC will deliver a methodology and software toolkit capable of predicting the degradation of special technology coatings designed to protect components in gas turbine engines. Modeling is anticipated to enhance the development, application, repair and maintenance of coating systems that are critical to gas turbine operations. The modeling technologies translate to all specialty coatings used in the engines systems.  Gas turbine engines are used by all branches of the DoD and numerous other government agencies for aerospace applications, transportation and power generation.  These government agencies will benefit from the modeling toolkit with reduced sustainment cost.  The commercial gas turbine engine market is $42 billion per year with current development efforts seeking new coating technologies to raise operating temperatures. The modeling methods developed in this work could greatly enhance those efforts."

In order to maximize its usefulness, the model must take into account both the coating and substrate materials working together as an interactive system.  The model must also account for environmental exposure (e.g. water, fluids, oxidation), dynamic and static strain effects, high temperature particulate impacts and abrasion, multi-frequency (low through high frequency inputs) vibrational effects, coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches between the coating and the substrate, etc.  BENEFIT:  The efforts associated with the sustainment and maintenance of specialty coatings on exhaust structures can be one of the significant cost drivers on state of the art platforms.  One of the industrys goals for quite some time has been to develop new coating materials that are more durable and require less sustainment and fewer maintenance operations.  In order for the material developers to fully understand what is required, it would be very useful to fully understand the environment and the interactions between the coatings and the substrates upon which they are applied."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Supersonic jet noise is a major issue affecting Department of Defense (DoD) flight operations. These issues include the near-field noise, which causes hearing damage specifically for Navy personnel on aircraft carriers. More relevant to Air Force operations, is the far-field or community noise problem. To address these problems, Spectral Energies, LLC proposes to develop a noise prediction tool for supersonic jet nozzles capable of interfacing with a gas turbine engine cycle analysis tool such as Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS). For Phase I, the noise model will be developed for a single geometry and validated against existing experimental and computational data. In Phase II, the noise prediction tool will evolve to account for different geometries (i.e. aspect ratio and shape) and will also have the ability to be integrated with existing engine cycle tools.  The effects of complex phenomena such as swirl, non-linear acoustic propagation, upstream turbulence, etc.  could be added to the tool as additional modules.  Since this tool will ultimately be used to predict noise for the full-scale aircraft and the cycle analysis provides information about the other engine components, it would be useful to incorporate the noise produced by other engine components as well. This tool can also be used to adjust the nozzle geometry and engine cycle to assess the potential for noise reduction without sacrificing the performance (thrust, fuel efficiency, and survivability).  BENEFIT:  The commercial products produced as result of this SBIR are the noise prediction tool, flow control methodologies, and measurement instrumentation. The main customers for the noise prediction code are the Air Force and Navy. Other potential costumers are General Electric, Pratt and Whitney, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and other aircraft\/engine companies. This tool may help aircraft companies develop engines that are quiet and have high fuel efficiency by integrating the noise tool into their existing cycle analysis codes.  In addition, institutions working on the supersonic commercial transport, such as Gulf Stream, Lockheed Martin, and NASA may be interested in the tools and knowledge developed for this study to help reduce supersonic shock noise."

The VTiP stem has adjustable pressure set points, maintains closure of the valve core, and can be applied to any aircraft wheel. A key cost benefit of the VTiP stem is compatibility with certified valve caps and valve cores, as well as current maintenance tools and gauges, including clip-on chucks, filling hoses, and manual pressure gauges. The VTiP stem will be easy to understand, easy to adjust, and easy to service; an individual with minimal training will be able to objectively assess tire inflation status visually and with better accuracy than judging by deflection alone. The VTiP stem empowers every crew member to quickly and accurately assess tire pressure.; BENEFIT: Maintenance on critical aircraft systems is costly and time-consuming. Any effort to curb these costs must ensure that safety, reliability, and performance are not compromised. The current method for accurately verifying an aircraft tires pressure requires a maintenance crew member to physically connect a gauge to a tire. This process requires time, training, and tools. Under-inflation of tires leads to a dramatically-increased rate of wear due to large deflection and heat building during landings. Lapses in routine pressure measurements can lead to increased costs from reduced tire lifetime and increased net workload of maintenance crews. The VTiP stem solves these problems."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The objective of the Phase I SBIR effort is to identify the feasibility of, and make recommendations for, a best practices solution for Landing Gear bushing installation. Primary goals of this effort will be to produce standardized procedures, products, and technology that will best facilitate the installation of bushings into high strength steel and aluminum Landing Gear components. During the development of this best practice approach, specific attention will be given to issues that have been identified as problem areas, e.g., bushing and component wear, corrosion, and bushing movement. Additionally, attention will be given to maintaining design and maintenance requirements including; functional capabilities, alignments, inspections, replacements, and load carrying capacities (to include fatigue degradation\/enhancement). Known bushing installation approaches that are currently being used in commercial and military aviation will be identified. These various installation procedures will be evaluated for applicability\/adaptability for landing gear use. Since each bushing installation can produce a unique set of requirements, the ability of the identified best practices approach to adapt to these variations will be evaluated. The proposed Phase I approach will perform research that will identify and characterize landing gear bushing requirements and processes at the Hill AFB repair depot and by field units. The Phase I effort will go on to investigate applicable academia studies and commercially available processes. A test and evaluation plan that will be proposed to evaluate and ultimately identify a best practices method. Implementation costs associated with the identified installation procedure will be evaluated in a preliminary Business Case Analysis (BCA) that will be developed and presented to the USAF as part of this Phase I effort. Return On Investment calculations will also be presented as a part of the BCA. Proof-of-concept prototypes will be manufactured to demonstrate conformance with requirements of the SBIR directives. ; BENEFIT: ES3 anticipates the results of Phase I work will validate the feasibility and need for immediate pursuit of Phase II efforts for standardized bushing installation procedures and products. After successful Phase II testing, the anticipated benefit will be the reduced number and frequency of rework requirements due to bushing and\/or gear component damage. An estimate of the annual savings will be determined in Phase I. The reduced depot and field operational costs will occur as a result of: A) Reduced bushing removal and replacement B) Reduced condemnation rates of gear components due to exceedance of rework limits C) Reduced gear overhaul flow days D) Reduced repeated bushing installation due to installation error E) Reduced requirement for field repair efforts F) Reduced number of Depot required overhauls resulting from bushing related damage"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In Air-Force landing gear systems, high strength CuBe alloys are used in bushing applications where high wear resistance and strength is critical. Beryllium can be toxic and presents health concerns; removal from DoD weapons systems is likely, and the need for Be-free replacement materials is critical. QuesTek Innovations, a leader in the field of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering, (ICME), proposes to evaluate two of its new, Be-free, advanced bushing alloys, Cuprium and QuestalloyTM CO, to replace the incumbent CuBe alloy C17200 in demanding bushing applications. These alloys were developed under previous DoD SBIR and private industry funding and are ready to be qualified for service. In Phase I, QuesTek will formally define performance goals, procure promising material candidates, and demonstrate technical feasibility with coupon-scale bushing wear testing and mechanical property testing. QuesTek has partnered with OEM Northrop Grumman, who will serve as the voice-of-the-customer, and Fatigue Technologies, who will serve as the voice-of-industry and assist in defining property goals and material assessment. Successful Phase I efforts will allow QuesTek to further characterize material performance in long-term wear testing, and outline necessary qualification procedures to enable the use of one or more new materials in flight-critical applications.; BENEFIT: By displacing a high-strength CuBe alloy, QuesTek anticipates commercial applications to include bushings, bearing traces, and other low-friction wear surfaces. Of these components, those in the aerospace industry are identified as the most likely replacement targets. Alternative CuBe applications, such as nozzles and seals may also be replaced with the materials developed under this funding."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  There is a need for a low cost reliable method to detect cracks in turbine engine components that utilize surface coatings for durability. Currently, many parts are scrapped due the cost of coating removal required to perform conventional inspection. Vibrothermography, or SIR, has shown to be a potential NDE process that may not require coating removal. Actual engine parts with representative fatigue cracks are needed to establish feasibility of this new NDE\/NDI method to reveal defects in parts during overhaul activities. This is a proposal to demonstrate the ability of SIR to produce representative fatigue cracks, and to detect cracks present in coated parts.      BENEFIT:  The effort proposed in this SBIR is a key step towards FTTs goal of becoming the provider of state-of-the-art NDE equipment based on vibrothermography technology.  Completion of the Phase II goal to deliver statistical quantities of cracked parts, followed by positive POD demonstration results (proposed by FTT as part of Airfoil Sustainment through Automated Inspection and Repair, AF151-054), will further validate one of the most compelling uses of vibrothermography Inspection. That application is to detect cracks lying beneath overlay coatings in critical components and thus eliminate the need to strip and recoat serviceable parts, resulting in significant cost avoidance.  In order to implement a new inspection technology, a statistically-based inspection reliability demonstration is required by Air Force structural integrity programs.  With few exceptions, a clear path to a valid POD demonstration in accordance with MIL-HBK-1823, Rev. A must be shown, or the new technology will be stalled.  It isn&apos;t likely that the challenge of designing suitable coated, cracked engine parts will be met without successful completion of this series of SBIR programs.  Widespread implementation of vibrothermography for Air Force engine programs would be stalled.     Assuming that the series of SBIR programs is successful, the population of coated cracked parts that is produced may be used for years through many demonstrations if they are properly maintained.  Possible uses extend beyond Air Force engines to other military services, and ultimately to commercial depot applications.  In addition to supporting the Air Force and other US military services and agencies with Enhanced AIIS systems, FTTs commercialization strategy  includes making the same equipment available to jet engine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and both airline and independent maintenance repair organizations (MRO) shops.  The strategy is important, because the sales of systems in the Military world is limited to perhaps ten systems in the immediate future.  However, if sufficient cost avoidance and increased safety can be shown in the commercial aircraft community, sales could number well over a hundred systems to facilities that routinely scrap or overhaul critical coated components."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Injuries from fires are a persistent threat to the safety of our soldiers and a can prove to be a massive source of devastation during both war and non-war times.  Current man portable fire suppression aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) systems spray a high pressure blast of foam that initially extinguishes the fire and then secondarily creates a film over the surface to prevent vapors from combusting while preventing alternate re-ignition sources from coming in contact with the any flammable materials.  While current AFFF fire containment and extinguishing techniques can be used to put out fires, there are materials still smoldering or materials that are still too hot to touch for quick removal risking the lives of people potentially trapped by hot or burning objects.    Lynntechs solution is to incorporate low cost intumescent nanocomposites of exfoliated clay nanoparticles with low thermal conductivities into existing AFFF systems.  The foaming nature of the AFFF extinguisher will effectively transport the clay nanocomposites onto objects enabling them to coat the surface.  When the clay nanocomposites flash dry, an expanded insulating char coating of clay nanoparticles will be left behind shielding the surface from heat enabling it to be touched.BENEFIT:Fluorosurfactant-containing foams, in particular aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF), are the most effective agents currently available to fight Class B flammable liquid fires at airports and in military, industrial, and municipal settings. Currently, the US military possesses the largest stockpile of AFFF in the United States.  This work has the potential to greatly enhance and advance the capabilities of rescuers and first responders to save the lives of personnel trapped in fires and flaming wreckage by enabling them to quickly traverse flame damaged areas more quickly than current fire suppression systems allow."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Over the course of their missions, Guardian Angel squadrons might encounter vehicles and aircraft fires in remote areas. In such a scenario, a lighter weight, more versatile, man-portable extinguisher would improve mission efficacy and reduce mission completion time. However, to realize this benefit, this extinguisher needs to be capable of suppressing class A and B fires, as well as thermally shielding critical assets in such a manner allowing their removal by a gloved hand. Because fire suppression and thermal shielding are two different functions achieved through different physical and chemical processes, ADA Technologies is proposing to develop a new multi-mode agent, made of a mixture of COTS fire suppressants and retardants (or thermal shields). By combining widely available, best-in-class, single-purpose agents, we expect that an affordable and highly versatile agent can be formulated and demonstrated. In Phase I, six such multi-mode agents will be manufactured in small quantities and tested on three small-scale fire scenarios: class A and class B fires, and hot metal surface insulation. This evaluation will lead to the identification of a new agent capable of meeting the GA Program performance objectives at reasonable weight and cost.BENEFIT:A next generation fire agent capable of tackling a multitude of tasks including fighting class A and B fires and providing an insulating layer on a hot metal surface would greatly enhance the GA\/PJ rescue capabilities. By carrying a single, lightweight, piece of equipment they could address a number of scenarios involving an aircraft or ground vehicle fire more effectively than today. Due to the risks involved in GA\/PJ missions, being able to quickly address a fire situation and successfully complete the mission is critical and can be the difference when a life is in the balance. In tense and hazardous settings, speed and efficacy are vital. The multi-mode agent development proposed by ADA Technologies is a first step towards providing GA\/PJ squadrons an urgently needed new tool.  The proposed multi-mode agent has potential commercial applications in DoD and non-DoD markets. Besides portable extinguishers for Special Forces such as the GA\/PJ, the new agent holds intriguing potential for application in aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF) vehicles, a large military and civilian market dominated today by class B foam (AFFF). These vehicles provide rapid fire suppression services to all airports and are mandated by the FAA in the US. Other markets can also be envisioned, such as protection of bus engine compartments and ship engine rooms."

This results in designing to accommodate potentially large defects, which results in additional weight and cost.    TRI\/Austin has teamed with Iowa State Universitys Center for Nondestructive Evaluation (CNDE) to develop nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques and analyses suitable for the whole life cycle management of highly curved composite components like leading edges and chines. We will develop NDE techniques and accompanying data analysis to start at production with initial, high capital intensive, high technology inspections. The following inspections at depot and field environments will be analyzed in the light of the original data for the range of inservice issues. Finally, we will use our modeling and experimental expertise to develop defect assessment capabilities. Accurate sizing in plane and in depth, and understanding of local properties in a defect or damage volume, enables better maintenance decisions.BENEFIT:The lack of ability to find and characterize defects in complex geometries leads to conservatism in design and additional weight\/lower performance in practice. This capability will enable better design and longer periods between costly inspections in service. We will develop and market a range of NDT systems and softwaqre for production, depot, and in-service use in military and commercial aerospace markets."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal addresses advanced materials processing technologies for production of high linearity and low voltage electro-optic modulators in engineered ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate. SRICO proposes to utilize proprietary crystal ion sliced thin film lithium niobate technology to implement a device structure uniquely designed for the development of high linearity electro-optic modulators. In-house capability to produce thin film lithium niobate provides SRICO the design freedom to implement novel device structures. Reliable nanometer scale formation of optical waveguide elements will be the key to implementation of a practical integrated RF photonic modulator. The key focus of Phase I will be on design, development, modeling and simulation, testing and trade-off analyses of the techniques and the structures to determine the optimal design and processing techniques for meeting the performance requirements. Phase I work will develop processing techniques to experimentally demonstrate total optical insertion loss of less than 6 dB.  Modeling, simulation, fabrication and test results will be used to identify a candidate modulator design for prototyping in Phase II that has optical insertion loss less than 6 dB, 3 dB optical bandwidth of 60 GHz for first sideband, V-pi &lt; 2 volts, and no third-order mixing products.  BENEFIT:  We anticipate that the platform materials engineering technologies developed during this effort will enable SRICO to lay the foundation for a breakthrough highly linearized, high speed electro-optic modulator product that will have multiple dual-use applications, particularly in military and civilian optical communications systems.  The low switching voltage modulator would be ideal for wideband optical signal processing for arbitrary waveform generation, optical filtering, A\/D conversion and beam forming applications.  Other key applications include phased array radar, free space optical communications, mobile communications, satellite communications, cable TV transmission, and short-reach optical networks."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies are bringing significant new capabilities to manufacturing.  However, a number of technical challenges remain before these capabilities can be fully exploited. The design, modeling and data management tools developed for subtractive, formative and mold-based manufacturing are not well suited for additive processes that allow pointwise and layerwise specification and control of 3D part fabrication. Specific challenges remain in specifying and designing material variations within a part, in utilizing process model information during the design process, in transmitting design decisions to various commercial AM machines, and in capturing process monitor data for part qualification. Currently there is no single integrated software solution to capture and manage large volumes of complex AM data. 3DSIM will leverage our knowledge, experience, and understanding to synthesize a comprehensive AM data management tool to capture, manage, and manipulate AM data sets. Specifically, 3DSIM proposes to develop a AM data management tool that would bridge the gap between existing CAD tools and proprietary AM planning and processing software, incorporate process modeling and process monitoring data, and further enable the potential of AM technologies.BENEFIT:An effective AM data management strategy will encompass all types and ranges of data that may be required for current and future AM processes. Such a strategy will fundamentally prescribe part shape, and will also provide a format for specifying location-specific properties of the part. The AM data management tool will support the expanding qualification, certification, simulation and design capabilities of AM   users."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The inspection requirements for the Air Force legacy fleets are becoming increasingly time-consuming. One of the driving forces of the lengthy inspection process is the inefficiency of current NDI systems in scanning very large areas due to the fact that traditional NDI systems are designed to inspect only directly beneath the probe or within a very small area around the probe, and thus inspection procedures developed for these traditional systems require tedious scanning of large regions. FBS proposes a guided wave phased array technology for rapid large-area inspection of aircraft outer mold lines for cracking and corrosion, which provides a radar-like inspection scan of an area up to 20 feet in diameter using patent-pending technology. Bulk wave phased array has revolutionized the ultrasonic testing of structures through their thickness by rapidly providing sector scans that are more intuitive than a traditional ultrasonic A-scan. In this same way, FBS has developed probes and technology that will revolutionize guided wave inspection by rapidly scanning large plates from a single probe position. The current technology is being developed for Navy ship hull inspection, but probe and hardware redesigns would allow this technology to be implemented for rapid inspections of large areas of aircraft.; BENEFIT: The proposed system will improve the efficiency of aircraft outer mold line inspection by rapidly generating radar-like scans of large areas. This technology would be applicable to fuselage sections, control surfaces, engine and fuel nacelles, wings, and more on commercial and military aircraft. The technology could also be adapted for non-aerospace applications. This technology has a clear path to commercialization by partnering with Olympus NDT, a worldwide leader in non-destructive testing equipment, and building on an existing commercialized guided wave hardware platform."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The United States Air Force has over 3000 active combat aircraft in operation. Maintenance of these aircraft is an integral part in keeping the fleet operational. Defects greatly impact the stability and integrity of the aircraft and can directly affect its performance. Since most of these defects and fractures occur beneath the skin on the plane, visual inspection is insufficient. Eddy current testing (ECT) is one of the NDI technologies that can be used for this detection and classification. The present method of ECT inspection of aircraft requires two separate scans at different frequencies. Running two scans and changing the scanning apparatus leads to long, costly maintenance times. A faster and more efficient way to do NDI is necessary to decrease the cost of maintenance and the downtime of each aircraft. RMD will address this by developing a hybrid multimode ECT-based scanning technology, which will have higher sensitivity than traditional ECT methods, and scan multiple frequencies simultaneously. This hybrid technology has the potential will reduce the inspection time to one half to one quarter of the time presently needed to inspect an airplane. RMD will work with Wyle Aerospace to develop new hybrid sensors for rapid non-destructive inspection of large aircraft. ; BENEFIT: The NDI system that RMD is developing is a breakthrough in eddy current testing that will reduce the time to perform to less than half the time required using existing commercial technology. Our technology can be used for a variety of NDI procedures on both military and commercial aircraft. These include:  Detection of subsurface flaws in aircraft  Evaluating bonded lap joints  Cyclic loading to discover cracks  Inspection of welds  Testing of axles and wheels in trains  Measurement of graphite nodularity in cast iron  Detection of variations in alloy, heat treatment, case depth, and the hardness of various metals RMD anticipates a five year commercialization plan, two years during the Phase II period, plus three years product development, marketing and sales ramp-up. During Phase I, we will identify and characterize market segments. We will establish detailed marketing and business strategies for the most promising market areas using company funds during Phase II. We will develop products that meet the needs of the Air Force. RMD will manufacture the sensors and sell OEM the sensors and system components to major NDI instrument manufacturers."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: An innovative NDI method, General Remote Field Eddy Current (GRFEC) method, is proposed for aircraft multi-layer deep structure NDI. GRFEC method is characterized by its deep penetration and high sensitivity features in multi-layer and complex deep structure NDI. The outstanding features have been proved by the AFRL validation\/evaluation programs and published at 2014 AA&amp;S Conference and 2014 ASIP Conference. Due to the deep penetration ability flaw can be detected directly from surface of a structure. This improves flaw detection beyond the first layer in multi-layered, complex, and difficult to access structures. Two approaches are proposed to upgrade GRFEC method. 1). to validate GRFEC systems ability in determining hidden flaw parameters and conditions directly from the structure surface, such as flaw location, length and orientation of a crack, single or multiple cracks, etc. Influence to flaw signal from structure geometry, such as edge condition and distance between fasteners, will also be addressed. The goal is enable straightforward NDI inverse problem solutions to avoid complicated inverse-problem algorithms and numerical modeling. 2). to provide easy airplane data capture and periodical NDI data storage approaches. Instant display of long-term periodical NDI data will be enabled in GRFEC system for a large number of inspected locations\/fasteners. Any sudden change in inspected signal of a location\/fastener should be a strong indication of possible defect or structure variation at the location before the last inspection time. Since no structure disassembly is involved in implementation of the NDI, all the work can be done quickly. Furthermore, the 2nd approach may possibly become a new way of Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) using a GRFEC system. ; BENEFIT: Anticipated Benefits\/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development. Significant improvement of overall NDI capabilities is promised by using the proposed GRFEC method, not only in reduction of the burden of time and cost intensive inspection, but also in insurance of the reliability of the inspection results, as well as in increase of the safety of continuous operation for the aging Air Force aircraft fleets."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Data transmission in communication systems, RADARs, satellite systems, and other military devices are dominated by analog data conversion.  These high performance digital to analog converters (DAC) exceed 3Gsps with 12 bits of resolution and are readily available in the commercial marketplace, but they lack the radiation hardness required to support military satellite applications.    Trusted Semiconductors Solutions has partnered with e2v, a proven commercial supplier of high performance data converters, to provide us access to DAC intellectual property. We have selected a commercial DAC that exceeds the performance requirements of this program and is well suited to hardening. The steps we will execute to harden the DAC include performing a radiation hardening assessment, retargeting the foundry technology, analyzing the radiation performance and implementing mitigation techniques. The technology we are targeting for the rad-hard DAC is a silicon germanium (SiGe) 180nm Bi-CMOS on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) process with 280GHz Fts.  The resulting rad-hard DAC will have 12-bit resolution, operate at 2Gsps, SNR of &gt;70dB and a SFDR &gt;80dB. It will operate at TID &gt;1Mrad(Si), SEU 1x1010  rad(Si)\/s and DRS &gt;1x1012  rad(Si)\/s.  This rad-hard DAC will be optimized for space based MILSATCOM and GPS applications.BENEFIT:Execution of this program provides the Air Force with a state-of-the art QML rad-hard DAC for space based MILSATCOM and GPS applications. Successful completion of Phase I and Phase II results in the delivery of a prototype radiation hardened Digital to Analog Converters. This 12-bit, radiation hardened DAC will have a sampling rate of 2Gsps, a signal to noise ratio of 70dB and spurious free dynamic range of 80DB. The DAC design and simulation work will be completed in Phase I, with the final GDSII database ready for fabrication. In Phase II, we will manufacture the DAC and test\/characterize the prototype devices for performance, radiation hardness and reliability. Prototype devices will be fabricated on-shore and parts assembled in a ceramic, hermetically sealed LGA package suitable for space flight. Full-scale radiation characterization testing will be performed including total ionizing dose testing with a Cobalt-60 source, heavy-ion testing for single event effects and latch-up, proton and neutron testing. Product upgrade and MIL-PRF-38535 space-level QML qualification testing will be performed in Phase III."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Todays depot maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) organizations routinely receive requests to undertake pressing workload for which there is no formally designated source of repair or for which the specified source of repair has insufficient capacity. Potential respondents must assess whether they have the necessary capabilities to perform the work and, if so, whether they have the capacity to meet production requirements. Both steps can be very labor- and time-intensive, both for the analysts in the business office as well as for production management, engineering, and shop floor technicians. The goal of the Dynamic Capacity Analysis and Planning (DCAP) effort is to define a methodology to enable real-time capability and capacity assessment especially when there is a lack of planning data. Knowledge Based Systems, Inc. proposes that this process can be streamlined first by establishing a common method and tools to support both capability and capacity analysis and second by providing a staged development of the needed capabilities. Ultimately, with adequate data support, these tools could be leveraged at headquarters for dynamic determination of available capacity across complexes, a practice that would eliminate the duplication of effort in preparing bids.; BENEFIT: The main benefits of the DCAP research include 1) cycle-time reduction, 2) cost reduction, and 3) on-time schedule performance. However applying the capabilities that are envisioned under this project on a broader scale can yield even greater potential benefits:  Greater success in new workload acquisition efforts;  Straightforward way to quantify return on investment (ROI) for capital purchases, certification training, and new hires; and  Improved promise date performance."

Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) is the inspection of a structure or component in any manner that will not impair its future usefulness. The purpose of the inspection may be to detect flaws, measure geometric characteristics, determine material structure or composition, or it may characterize physical, electrical, or thermal properties without causing any changes in the part. There are five standard NDI disciplines which include: 1) Liquid Penetrant 2) Magnetic Particle 3) Eddy Current 4) Ultrasonic and 5) Radiography. There are also many new and emerging technologies and capture data from thermography, shearography and digital photographs.; BENEFIT: This collaborative environment will allow organizations to focus on their digital thread and forces attention to problems where they live, in conversation with the people who live with them and whose current actions are contributing to the problems. For the Air Force to leverage the Art of the Possible all these problems must become opportunities for improvement of the process and harness the power of enterprise collaboration to gain the necessary outcomes. This SBIR provides the foundation for this environment and can be leveraged to develop solutions that focus on improvement."

Next, we will demonstrate digital inspection data entry at the point of maintenance with the ICARR-3D tablet computer software developed by Mercer Engineering Research Center (MERC). The inspection results will be stored in Etegents NLign software package for analysis, visualization, engineering collaboration, and trending.; BENEFIT: The benefits of the proposed solution include reduced NDI inspection time, improved data accuracy, and greater usability of inspection results. These benefits would help the Air Force by reducing the amount of time that aircraft are unavailable due to maintenance and by capturing the detailed engineering data needed for Digital Twin and Digital Thread in a way that doesnt burden inspectors. These benefits would also help the aerospace manufacturing industry by reducing inspection time during manufacturing of aircraft and components."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Chemical stripping solution processes are used at Tinker AFB, and other repair depots, to remove specialty coatings such as zinc-nickel plating, chrome plating, etc. For the majority of the stripping processes, the chemistry is defined in the Technical Orders.  However, the Technical Orders do not provide process parameter information or guidance on operation of the stripping processes. Research of the stripping processes is required to optimize the stripping rate to decrease flow days and increase life of part through minimizing part time in solution.    During Phase I, ES3 will perform research on the stripping processes employed at Tinker AFB.  The research will seek to understand key process variables that have an effect on time and cost to the stripping operation. The research will define the best methods to establish metal build-up limits that would then be used to determine when it is most cost effective to continue processing with a stripping solution versus replacing the solution.  A test plan will be developed that provides the concept and methodology for optimization and cost reduction of the stripping processes.   ES3 will demonstrate and validate the test plan by determining stripping efficiency as a function of metal build-up level, for one stripping process.      BENEFIT:  ES3 anticipates the results of Phase I work will validate the feasibility and need for immediate pursuit of Phase II efforts for multiple stripping solutions utilized at Tinker AFB.  After successful Phase II testing, development and implementation of the optimized stripping processes at the Tinker AFB repair depot, the immediate benefit will be reduced shop operational costs.  An estimate of the annual savings will be determined in Phase I.  The reduced shop operational costs will occur as a result of:    A)  Higher throughput,    B)  Reduced re-processing,     C)  Reduced flow days,    D)  Improved effectiveness of the stripping systems,    E)  More effective use of engineering support (through statistical process control), and  F)  Reduced part or substrate damage.  These process improvements will be applicable to both military and commercial repair facilities that utilize coating removal processes"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Thermal spray is an enabling manufacturing technology for aero-engines supporting both OEM and engine overhaul. Thermal spray manufacturing has many inherent complexities within each sub-process, including feedstock, component surface preparation and masking, process parameter selection, robot motion, plume trajectory, local coating deposition condition, and laboratory coating qualification. Each sub-process is governed by specifications that provide TS operators and engineers with procedural and parametric guidelines per application. However, these sub-processes are often disconnected in the manufacturing cycle and as such there is no unifying approach to collect data, establish process maps, visualize and interpret outcome of the deposited coating. Integrated, adaptive, knowledge management platform is proposed that will provide a real time activity dashboard of the various sub-processes through both user input and sensor information. The knowledge management system will connect the input\/output among the sub-processes and incorporate process diagnostic information as well as laboratory test outcomes. The system will be adaptive to display historical patterns in the form of control charts and learn from the data to provide predictive capability in terms of success and failure. The Dashboard will be user configurable and modular allowing different displays based on end-user required functions (TS operators, engineers, lab technologist, and managers).  BENEFIT:  Successful development of the AF151-166 SBIR program will enable a framework for seamless implementation of Integrated Adaptive Knowledge Management Dashboard Platform to USAF and industrial Thermal Spray coating manufacturing process. This proposed knowledge management platform will benefit wide variety of personnel involved in TS manufacturing process. TS production operators will be able to rapidly diagnose any process hardware anomaly and provide appropriate corrective measures to meet the process specification. The process and repair development engineers can the process evolution within the context of preestablished maps and thus have higher confidence while providing witness coupon for lab quality control, shortening qualification duration. The knowledge management dashboard will facilitate decision making process for engineers who will have a readily available process and sensor output information as well as laboratory analysis. Coating quality control technologist will have improved communication capability with process engineers ensuring system wide reliability. Furthermore, Cognizant engineers and managers will have on-demand statistical assessment of process\/coating repeatability, reproducibility, and reliability. Additionally, this Integrated Adaptive Knowledge Management Dashboard Platform can benefit both system OEMs and spray shops to facilitate existing specification update, rapid establishment of new specification, and production performance assessment (including cost analysis)."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  There is a stated need for enhanced capabilities to strip functional coatings from, e.g., military aerospace parts, due to saturation behaviors exhibited by current stripping methods.  In the proposed program, Faraday will develop low-cost, environmentally-sound drop-in\/add-on unit operations based on pulsed FARADAYIC Stripping and ElectroWinning technologies, which would require only a power supply swap-out and installation of an auxiliary process tank, respectively.  Faraday will establish processing conditions that allow for efficient FARADAYIC Stripping and FARADAYIC ElectroWinning recovery of dissolved metals, and evaluate the enhancement to stripping solution lifetime and processing rate afforded by this combination of technologies.  We will identify suitable target operating metals concentrations to enable an appropriate balance of stripping rate\/efficacy and electrowinning efficiency.  We will initiate development of a transition plan for future implementation at Air Force and\/or commercial partner maintenance facilities and perform an analysis of the economics, safety and material compatibility of the technology. Phase II will entail design and construction of a pilot-scale apparatus to strip coatings from specific aerospace parts of interest; evaluation of FARADAYIC Stripping performance on various substrate materials; development of alpha-scale components for prototype testing at Boeing and Air Force facilities; and completion of the technology transition plan.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated result of the proposed program is the demonstration, development and deployment of a low-cost, environmentally-benign augmentation of existing WC-Co HVOF stripping operations. In particular, application of pulsed FARADAYIC Stripping and Electrowinning technologies will be investigated for their capability to enhance stripping solution lifetime and enable recovery of dissolved metals.  The process is scalable, will integrate directly with equipment available at USAF depots, and will result in significant cost reductions through extended lifetimes of stripping solutions and increased part stripping rates.  Interest is also anticipated in the commercial aircraft market, as well as in any market segment in which wear-resistant coatings are needed, such as construction equipment, rail transportation manufacture, paper mill roll fabrication, and high-strength valve seals for undersea oil\/gas extraction applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Stripping and reapplication of inorganic coatings is a necessary step in the lifecycle management of aircraft components. As the baths for stripping are used, the strip rates and quality of the stripping can vary resulting in inefficient processing. Inefficient processing can drastically increase the time required to service a component. Information is needed to determine the factors that cause these changes, the optimal process window, and allow determination of the limits of a stripping solution.    To address this, Figure Engineering intends to develop an automated analysis and control system for stripping baths. This system will continuously monitor key components of each stripping bath and perform selective electrochemical filtration to maintain them at optimum levels.  BENEFIT:  Figure Engineering anticipates the results of Phase I work will validate the feasibility and need for immediate pursuit of Phase II efforts. Figure Engineering anticipates that the optimization of metal stripping processes will provide DoD and aerospace industry with a faster and more reliable means for the removal of deposited coatings on aircraft components. It also allows for significant man-hour savings, reduced process flow days and inventory cost avoidance. This process improvement will lead to a reduction of the following 1) production floor space, 2) energy consumption, 3) line maintenance and 4) process chemical waste."

The objective is to monitor the mechanical condition of high-stress parts such as rotor blades while the aircraft is in flight. Rotor blade stress information accumulated this way will be available wirelessly to maintenance crews, and will support a condition-based maintenance program. The interrogator is highly self-contained and configurable to acquire as much data as possible using limited power available to it through energy harvesting."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy?s need for a low-cost, low-power, lightweight, multichannel optical fiber interrogator for structural health management of rotor blades, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Multichannel Optical Fiber Interrogator (MOFIN). This proposed rotor health monitoring technology is based on the use of fiber Bragg grating sensor arrays and a high-speed edge-filtering demodulation method utilizing an arrayed waveguide and an ultrafast optical switch. Specifically, the innovative system design and the use of miniature, low power planar light wave circuit photonic devices and optoelectronic components will enable the MOFIN to measure strains from more than 15 locations in a single blade at a data rate of &gt;5 KHz using less than 3 W power from energy harvesting units. As a result, this fiber interrogator offers a multi-functional, on-rotor, and impact- and usage-degradation monitoring tool which directly addresses the Navy requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of MOFIN by building a benchtop prototype using commercial off-the-shelf components and testing in a laboratory-scale rotor blade test rig. In Phase II, POC plans to build a complete field-ready prototype reaching technology readiness level TRL-5+ and be ready for initial testing in a naval rotorcraft."

In Phase I, ROI will design, engineer, and assemble a laboratory prototype of stand-alone multi-channel MOFIS? transceiver interrogation system and use it to interrogate an array (&amp;#8805;15-channels) of FBG sensor transducers deployed over a single sensor fiber with a spectral dynamic range of ?10,000-microstrains and a resolution of 0.1-microstrains suitable for the real time structural health monitoring of rotorcraft blades. In Phase II will produce a field deployable ultra-low power, small form factor MOFIS? SHM system and demonstrate its performance for operation under the environment conditions of a helicopter rotor blade. In Phase III, with the support of a strategic partner, the WiFOS technology will be transitioned to Navy operations."

Our novel sensing system consists of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor array interrogated by a light-weight, low-power, stand-alone optical detection system combined with state-of-the-art multichannel wireless data acquisition node. Veraphotonics technology offers a number of advantages including compact sensors and miniaturized system-on-a-chip (SoC) based interrogation instrument which incorporates field programmable gate array (FPGA) based closed loop feedback control algorithms for robust sensor wavelength demodulation integrated with power conditioning for low power management and strain mapping software for strain data display. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the stand-alone, compact multi-channel interrogation system?s capability to wirelessly measure load, vibration, and AE response for monitoring composite rotor blade structures under loading. A strain mapping algorithm will also be developed to display strain and vibration data in real time. In Phase II, the low-power multifunctional sensor device will be developed for field use to monitor load history and detect damage presence and locations in helicopter rotor blades."

It is rare to find an industry as large as this that has managed to continue existence without any significant manufacturing technique changes since the original fuel cells were made decades ago. Some of the materials have changed, but the fact that fuel cells are still manufactured by hand remains the same. This method is slow, inconsistent, and expensive. We have developed a fuel cell manufacturing technique that will produce tanks in hours, not days, not months, and especially not years. This technique takes the handwork out of the equation. Our process produces fuel cell after fuel cell without deviation in dimensions or fitting and accessory placement. This process has been subjected to and passed Federal Aviation Administration fuel cell testing specifications for commercial application. Most of this testing mirrors the testing required by the Navy. We have done all in our power to reduce the risk for the Navy (and ourselves) to ensure that our process will produce fuel cells that pass all Navy requirements. The time has come for the Navy to get high quality, inexpensive fuel cells, without long lead-times."

Self-sealing tanks and bladders provide a means to protect tanks and dry bays from fires and explosions in case of kinetic hit. ADA Technologies, with industry partners ARM-USA and Boeing, proposes to leverage its past research in cutting edge self-sealing materials and associated manufacturing techniques to develop an innovative solution fitting the Navy?s need. The proposed solution is a layered, self-healing ionomer copolymer wall construction, combined with a fuel-compatible liner. Both layers will be produced via an industrial coating technique called thermal spraying. This quick and repeatable approach will accelerate the rate of production of fuel cells and reduce cost, while providing reliable, repeatable and instantaneous sealing in case of wall puncture by a projectile. Previous research by ADA demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and the instantaneous self-sealing capability. In the present Phase I, the technology will be further developed by refining the manufacturing process and producing flat multi-layer panels that will be used in MIL-DTL-5578 gunfire tests."

        "abstract": "There exists a gap today in the Computer Aided Design (CAD) technology that is used for designing parts and the Finite Element Method (FEM) technology that is used for engineering analysis. The CAD files are first generated and then are converted into appropriate input files for FEM. CAD and FEM use different mathematical representations of geometry and converting one form into another is a laborious and time consuming process. In this SBIR effort, TDA?s team and its university partner, University of Texas at Austin (Prof. T. J. R. Hughes and Prof. G. Rodin), will use a novel technique known as isogeometric analysis, first proposed by Prof. Hughes, to bridge the gap between CAD and FEM. In isogeometric analysis, the same basis functions are used to represent geometry and the solution space, and as a result, CAD and FEM can be effectively combined. An integrated framework will be developed where CAD modeling, isogeometric analysis and post-processing of results, will all be performed in a seamless manner. The focus will be towards creation of analysis suitable input files from CAD software or from reversed engineered parts, development of isogeometric finite\/boundary element codes, and creation of output files viewable in a graphical post-processor."

One example is when test systems as a whole or tester subsystems become obsolete. A typical approach is to perform one off engineering investigation that requires extensive use of high value personnel and recurring effort that could be automated using technology based approaches. The automated technologies could also support various acquisition decision criteria where policy requires existing test equipment families to be evaluated during the ATS acquisition process. Additionally, as potential for inter-operational test programs increases, the need for tools that can deterministically characterize test program applicability for different test systems could greatly reduce manual efforts and eliminate potential to attempt usage of target systems whose capability is not a match for either specific test programs or envelopes of test requirements that encompass groups of test programs. Resulting technologies will empower developers, program managers and acquisition professionals in alleviating redundant effort, providing indisputable data for deterministic decision making and fostering improved interoperation."

The anticipated result of this proposed Phase I research effort is the development of the concept for parsing TPS source code and extracting metrics that leverages other sources of data, such as log data and UUT maintenance data. The tasks of the basic effort will have focused on defining the TPS source code processing and metrics extraction toolset and its required elements, defining the requirements for the different software components and data representations, development of initial prototypes of key components using sample data provided by the customer, and demonstration of the feasibility of the concept with the prototypes developed. The option effort will have extended the basic effort to implement a prototype integrated metrics extraction capability, where the focus of the research will have been on how the initial prototypes of the software components, data representations, and user interface can be integrated to demonstrate the concept feasibility of incorporating ATS log data in the metrics extraction process. The Phase I proof-of-concept demonstration will verify concepts and assumptions, validate the concept, and provide a reference for extending the metrics extraction toolset capabilities with additional functionality in Phase II, such as TPS simulation, to satisfy fully customer data processing and analysis requirements."

Though it is technically possible to create a tactical network that is comprised of different IP-enabled radios, such networks are fundamentally ill-suited to the changes in topology and link quality typical of a carrier strike group&apos;s networked air-, sea-, and land-based elements. ATCorp proposes S-FAN ? a low-SWaP, ruggedized router that can be mounted in carrier-based aircraft such as the E2 Hawkeye and even in much smaller airborne platforms. In addition to providing pervasive, adaptive communications over disparate communications links, the proposed S-FAN effort seeks to develop a dramatic improvement in router configuration that allows tactical networks, such as that employed by a carrier strike group, to be rapidly created and modified. The proposed effort leverages off-the-shelf, MIL-STD-810G hardware that ATCorp has previously flight tested."

In this SBIR, Diversified Technologies, Inc.

The innovative ignition system proposed will operate as a conventional system under normal conditions but will be capable of producing an enhanced ignition kernel (extended duration discharge) under difficult-to-ignite or emergency conditions. The system will be a form-fit-function replacement of existing equipment, easing adoption and certification of this technology. DTI?s strength is its pulsed power expertise; therefore the focus of the SBIR effort will be on the exciter portion of the ignition system. In Phase I, DTI will leverage cutting-edge high frequency switching technology to design and build a flexible research ignition exciter capable of exploring a wide range of electrical parameters. DTI will collaborate closely with Navy personnel and Pratt &amp; Whitney to inform, test, and characterize the performance of the exciter under relevant conditions under the Phase I effort."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy?s need for a rapid and reliable measurement technology for high-curvature surfaces such as compressor airfoils, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Rapid Advanced Optical Scanner (RAOS). This proposed scanner solution is based on a new optical module design with multiple cameras inspecting surfaces illuminated by a sharp, line-shaped laser beam. The RAOS employs efficient image processing software and 3D point-cloud analysis algorithms that POC has developed for related metrology systems. Specifically, the innovation in the optical module design and image processing will enable the RAOS system to inspect high-curvature surfaces with polished finishes. As a result, the system will rapidly and reliably inspect parts with complicated geometry and high-curvature surfaces, such as compressor airfoils and other integrally bladed rotors, which directly addresses the system requirements. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the RAOS technology by performing profile measurements using RAOS on test samples with highly curved surfaces, achieving technology readiness level (TRL)-4. In Phase II, POC plans to enhance, optimize, and ruggedize the RAOS technology to meet all of the Navy?s requirements and reach TRL-7."

        "abstract": "The airfoil components of modern turbines and engines are highly complex critical parts where accurate and detailed geometry knowledge is required for manufacturing and maintenance. Commercially available metrology systems use contact (touch) probes that are slow and inefficient to inspect the complex profiles inherent to airfoils. Current non-contact (optical) systems operate at significantly faster speeds, but are also challenged by high-curvature surfaces and in addition suffer from edges\/signal effects such as attenuation and glare. Furthermore, because airfoils have features with sizes similar in magnitude to the location tolerance with respect to the overall part datum planes, multi-pass measurements are often necessary to achieve desired accuracy, leading to slower inspection times. Well-suited to address these challenges is the Automated Integrated Technology? (AIM?) system, a recently-commercialized, non-contact technology that rapidly measures surface shapes precisely (accuracies &lt; 0.0005?, with &gt;25,000 measurements\/second ) and can be deployed as a stand-alone system or integrated into existing CNCs. The proposed research will quantify the accuracy and potential speed improvements achievable by extending the AIM? technology to airfoil metrology"

This semiconductor based solution allows for large scale inexpensive fabrication, using our standard 3 inch Indium Phosphide fabrication line. The monolithic integration platform enables complete transmitter chips, with reduced loss between the laser and the modulator, improving the device performance and efficiency and reducing the packaging complexity and increasing the reliability. Our solution will lead to lowest possible cost, size, weight and power consumption."

Communication is essential for enabling UAV applications. A major challenge in a rapidly growing UAV secure command, control, and communications area is ensuring the transmission of critical information in Anti-Access Area-Denial (A2AD) bandwidth-limited environments. Architecture Technology Corporation (ATCorp) will design and implement an innovative software-defined tool that monitors tactical networks? available bandwidth and dynamically adapts application flows to optimize the delivery of critical messages in a multiple UAV mission environment. The software-defined tool, which we will refer to as ADEPT, will enable UAVs to autonomously and dynamically adapt to varying A2AD bandwidth-limited environments to ensure the transmission of critical information content for Command and Control decisions, as well as other mission critical data. ADEPT will consist of multiple software components. These components will reside within the UAVs and the network operation centers."

        "abstract": "Airborne Expendable Infrared Countermeasures (AEIRCMs) are deployed to alter the trajectory of infrared guided missiles that pose a threat to aircraft. Many AEIRCMs utilized by the Navy are ignited using a Safe-and-Arm (S&amp;A) igniter assembly that ignites a Magnesium\/Teflon?\/Viton? (MTV) pellet, which in turn transfers energy to the countermeasure?s first fire\/main grain. MTV, however, degrades quickly in the presence of moisture. Furthermore, magnesium reacts with moisture to form hydrogen gas (H2), which is highly flammable and potentially dangerous upon ignition. Most importantly, the degradation of the MTV igniter pellet can result in non-ignitions, putting personnel who rely on countermeasures in danger when their protection is needed most. What is needed is an igniter formulation that retains the combustion and burning properties of the current MTV ignition formulation, but is less susceptible to degradation by moisture. TDA has identified igniter formulations that are more moisture stable than MTV and can be formulated to retain the energetic performance of the current MTV formulation. Thus, TDA will develop a drop-in replacement for the current MTV ignition composition that is more stable in the presence of moisture."

        "abstract": "The SMART (Sensor Monitoring Automated Reporting Technology) system for automated acoustic monitoring will provide advanced information on sensor health, significantly increasing the abilities of operators to manage sensor health while reducing the overall workload associated with sensor management. SMART automatically monitors noise sources in order to assess their effects on sensor performance. Noise sources monitored include self noise, platform noise, and environmental noise. Sensors monitored include the AN\/SQS-20 (TB-37U) Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) and the AN\/SQS-53C Hull Array. PMFL (performance monitoring fault localization) reports are simultaneously monitored and analyzed with noise sources. Based on the sources monitored and the results of the automated analysis, clear information on sensor status and performance is provided to operators, along with clear recommendations for corrective actions. Corrective actions may include recommendations for specific diagnostic procedures, processing option recommendations (such as selecting ABF or CBF), and recommendations to rely on one sensor over another. Condition based maintenance (CBM) prognosticates the future health of sonar sensors using data from those sensors and PMFL data. Data relevant to acoustic monitoring and CBM are saved into a centralized data repository for subsequent analysis to improve acoustic monitoring and CBM algorithms, thus enabling optimum system performance and maintenance."

        "abstract": "Navy combat systems employ many underwater acoustic sensors to detect submerged threats. The performance of these sensors must be maintained at high levels for the combat system to perform effectively. These sensors are exposed to harsh environments and operating conditions that, over time, compromise sensor health resulting in degraded detection performance. Additionally, excessive radiated noise emitted from the platform may limit the performance of these sensors contributing to degraded sensor and system detection performance. Although the Navy currently monitors and presents operators sensor health and self-noise for many of its acoustic sensors; these data are not provided to the combat system for use in calculating sensor performance for threat detection or in maintaining an optimized system configuration. The U.S. Navy needs an automated acoustic monitoring system to alert operators to degraded sensor performance due to platform self-noise and sensor health, and making these data available to the combat system for use in calculating detection performance. HighRez Consulting?s expertise in the areas of beamforming, sensor self-noise monitoring, sensor metrics, performance prediction and system engineering within the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15 and AN\/BQQ-10(V)A-RCI programs provides invaluable knowledge in strategies for successfully developing, testing, integrating, transitioning, and deploying the innovative technologies developed in this research."

        "abstract": "The U.S. submarine force relies heavily upon GPS for accurate position fixing and safe navigation when far from land. However, given the relative ease with which GPS can be jammed or disabled, this reliance is cause for concern. The submarine force is in need of an alternative position fixing source that is robust to such interference efforts. Aret? Associates proposes to address this problem with the development of Hyperion, an automated celestial navigation algorithm that will provide accurate position fixes with little burden to the operator. Based on a submarine?s assumed position, Hyperion will select candidate stars and direct the periscope system to collect images of these stars. It will then detect the stars in the images and associate them with almanac data. Finally, it will calculate a celestial rotation to align the imaged stars with their known positions based on the assumed position. The position fix will be generated by translating this celestial rotation into an offset to be applied to the submarine?s assumed position."

        "abstract": "The Iridium satellite constellation consists of 66 low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, primarily used for global data and voice communications. The satellites transmit in the L-Band at carrier frequencies from 1616MHz to 1626.5MHz. Using one of the Iridium satellite?s paging channels to broadcast time and frequency measurements, a ground receiver can collect these measurements for computing position fixes. Unlike GPS satellites, Iridium satellites use spot beams to focus their transmissions on a relatively small geographic area. Each satellite supports 48 spot beams. The Iridium satellite spot beams provide a unique mechanism that is extremely difficult to spoof or jam. NAL Research proposes to develop an Iridium position navigation and time (PNT) receiver to collect Iridium signals for geolocation determination. The receiver will have similar form-factor as a commercial GPS receiver or a SAASM GPS receiver. It will provide ocean platforms an alternate method for truly global (pole-to-pole) geo-positioning."

        "abstract": "The acoustic environment encountered in pulsed active sonar provides some of the most formidable challenges seen in modern signal processing. The confluence of strong bottom clutter, ownship Doppler spreading, and discrete mutual interference results in clutter leakage and sidelobes across beam and Doppler spaces. Platform motion causes clutter returns to be shifted in Doppler, leading to elevated noise ?shoulder? near the zero Doppler ridge, impacting the detection and classification of low Doppler contacts. Current adaptive signal processing algorithms suffer from sample support limitations due to the rapidly changing active environment. In order to prevent signal suppression and maintain robust performance, these algorithms must be run conservatively, limiting their ability to null clutter and interference. In this proposal, Adaptive Methods outlines a new and innovative approach to active sonar signal processing. We build upon our experience in rapid adaptation to provide the next generation of active signal processing. Our approach, termed the Robust Active Signal Processing Adaptive Processor (RASAP) enables aggressive robust adaptation in sample starved environments. This approach mitigates the corruptive effects of interference and leakage while minimizing impact on downstream processing, leading to improved detection, tracking, and classification performance."

Our approach to this employs a hybrid fusion system employing a blend of Hard Association, XMAP, and Soft Association, JPDA, combined with Metron&apos;s advanced particle filter based multi-target tracker, NodestarPLUS to provide a fully automated, but operator supervised, fusion process for submarine combat systems. To initiate tracks we use our latest advancement in Intensity Filters, iLRT. Our ITK\/TRK framework fully exposes to operator the underlying ?staff-work? being performed by automation in a manner that allows him full supervisory oversight of the process."

        "abstract": "Electronic Warfare (EW) systems Human Machine Interface (HMI) is used to classify and correlate electronic emissions. The HMI must maximize operator efficiency and support effective decision making and must create a workspace that reduces the operator?s manual interaction with the system. In order to capture the HMI requirements, SEA CORP will follow a structured process to study the AN\/BLQ-10 operator workflow and capture the results in an HMI Concept of Operations (CONOPS). SEA CORP successfully employed this process, based on interaction with fleet personnel and subject matter experts, in defining new HMI concepts for the AN\/BYG-1 Weapon Control System (WCS) Strike Displays. This effort will define a display framework, based on the CONOPS, which will decrease the number of menus, controls and windows, providing the operator more intuitive operations. The displays will be designed to support a touch screen user interface in accordance with the SWFTS HMI common style guide. SEA CORP will utilize the existing EW Server API\/ toolkit to obtain the organic and non-organic datasets and create a display widget library that will support a highly extensible system. As a result, the HMI architecture design will facilitate easy integration and future growth of the EW HMI."

        "abstract": "The current AN\/BLQ-10 HMI is an amalgam of non-integrated applications through which the EW operator must navigate to assess and analyze the electromagnetic spectrum. During the initial ascent to periscope depth, he is inundated with emissions from all types of radars ranging from commercial navigation radars aboard merchant and pleasure craft to ASW equipment aboard maritime patrol aircraft. Critical time is consumed configuring individual tools and displays to identify potential threats to the safety and stealth of the ship. Emitters not identified by the AN\/BLQ-10 are prosecuted manually by poring over hard-copy volumes containing operating parameters for thousands of known radars. Progeny Systems proposes to develop a modular, extensible and open HMI platform for the AN\/BLQ-10 EW System that allows the supervisory operator to configure the display components to work together to conduct RF signal analysis thereby reducing the amount of manual interaction and overall time required to complete safety and threat assessment. The modularity of the design enables integration of existing applications with relative ease. Other key features include improved emitter contact management with database driven platform correlation, enhanced data visualization and an interface for emitter data record\/review\/playback control."

Advanced compression methodologies, which combine multiple individual compression algorithms with the concept of representing time-series data via mathematical representations which result in very little information loss, can create up to 99% reduction in the volume of data to be sent off-hull. However, in addition to these technologies, approaches such as the intelligent prioritization of outbound data and effective management of the available outbound bandwidth will be applied to create a holistic solution to the problem. All of this can be done with a clear eventual transition path in mind ? the software architecture already planned for use on LCS."

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses issues concerning operation of the Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) system in unseen locales and against unseen target types. The COBRA detection algorithms are based on statistical classifiers that are trained using samples from past data collects. As a result, the algorithms may not perform well against unseen situations. Further, once data have been collected in new situations the algorithms may need to be re-optimized, but this is currently a time-consuming effort that requires subject matter expertise. To mitigate these issues Aret? proposes a two-fold approach that aims to improve COBRA detection performance both in previously seen and in new, unseen locales. One aspect of this approach involves developing an offline, stand-alone application called the COBRA Optimization Tool (COBRA OT), which automatically determines the best values of algorithm parameters to provide optimal performance of the algorithms. The second thrust involves creating context-adaptive algorithms by identifying and exploiting information concerning the background settings (contexts) of data collects to improve local detection performance. The two aspects of Aret??s approach are complementary: context-adaptive algorithms will improve performance in each locale, and COBRA OT will optimize algorithm performance globally across all locales."

        "abstract": "Automated Target Recognition (ATR) technologies offer potential for automated detection and recognition of targets of interest in imagery data with enhanced accuracy. Most existing ATR algorithms are trained on fixed datasets and cannot change during deployment. As a consequence, these ATR systems are likely to have degraded performance when deployed at unseen environments that are not covered by the training data. Whenever new data or new classes of targets need to be added, the baseline approach is to retrain the ATR system from scratch. Such offline retraining usually demands significant amount of computations which causes operational downtime, and is not suitable for online during-mission analysis. Current systems also lack an efficient framework to interact with operator for online learning and adapting to new environments.In this project, UtopiaCompression Corp. (UC) proposes to build a novel MUlti-spectral Visual Incremental Knowledge Assimilation System (MUVIKAS) as a software program that facilitates in-situ target detection and classification in multi-spectral imagery with human in the loop. The system self-adapts to varying scene backgrounds and to inputs from human operator, based on a novel incremental ATR algorithm that perpetually assimilates new and relevant information into the existing knowledge database in an incremental fashion."

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I Proposal addresses the need for Next Generation Targets. The present EMATT diameter is 4.875 inches and with its current conventional cylindrical transducer is limited in attaining desired levels at lower frequencies. The objective of the Phase I SBIR program is to define and develop concepts for a candidate wide band transducer system that provides the acoustic response over the low frequency and sonar band spectrum and a design that fits within a threshold maximum diameter of 12.75 inches by proposing a six inch diameter design and the possibility of a low frequency design which fits into a 4.875 inch diameter vehicle. We propose to bridge the low frequency acoustic performance gap between the current A-sized EMATT ASW target and the MK30 performance. The major challenge is to produce the acoustic performance in the low frequency range within a small diameter ASW target. Image Acoustics is proposing an advanced transducer that would provide wideband acoustic performance for the next generation small diameter expendable mobile training targets."

        "abstract": "Gougeon Brothers Inc. is submitting a proposal to address the need for a temporary repair procedure for 5xxx series aluminum U.S. Navy ship structures that have stress corrosion cracking issues. The proposal explains how an innovative toughened thixotropic epoxy adhesive can be used to wet out reinforcing fabrics to a surface with simple surface preparation. This concept takes advantage of the work already accomplished by NAVSEA with the permanent composite patch solution and simplifies the products and surface preparation. A thixotropic epoxy adhesive eliminates the use of liquids that can spill and eliminates the ability need to mix and measure. Cartridges that dispense a pre-measured amount of resin hardener through a static mixer will enable easy use aboard ship. The epoxy adhesive will be shear thinning which allows a gel like adhesive to be easily saturate a light weight reinforcing fabric. Testing to evaluate the performance of this repair method will include tensile adhesion, lap shear, and laminate strength testing to determine the ability to stop crack propagation. GBI?s experience developing, manufacturing, and marketing epoxy resins and adhesives will enable this repair kit to be commercialized to the U.S. Navy, U.S.C.G., and operators of commercial ships."

        "abstract": "Existing repair methodologies for cracked structures aboard US Navy ships are currently limited in efficiency and effectiveness. New repair methodologies that directly address the local stress states leading to fatigue cracking and stress corrosion cracking are possible with laser peening technology. The proposed laser peening solution allows repairs independent of the cracked structure geometry, requires no hazardous chemicals, requires no additional NDI, and does not jeopardize the existing structure or corrosion resistance of the material. To demonstrate this materiel solution, proof of concept is demonstrated through a rigorous coupon testing program that replicates in-service cracking conditions and the treatment of these crack conditions via laser peening. Further technology developmental efforts are focused on identifying requirements, options, and an optimal solution for a portable laser peening system design. The laser peening system concept will be designed to meet the key performance metrics for the laser peening process, the size and mobility requirements for shipboard usage, and the hazard mitigation requirements for laser peening in an open environment. The portable laser peening system is anticipated to achieve significant cost savings in comparison to conventional laser peening systems through the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components."

        "abstract": "This proposal is for the development of a unique, ultra-portable, low-cost, hand-held high-pressure cold spray system for repairing cracks on aluminum structures on surface ships that were damaged by corrosion, based on a patent-pending cold spray device which has already be developed for shop or laboratory based applications. In the cold spray process, powder particles are accelerated by a supersonic gas jet at a temperature lower than the melting point of the material, resulting in the formation of a metallurgically-bonded coating from particles in the solid state. Because the temperatures of the cold spray process are significantly lower than other thermal spray processes, surfaces can be easily repaired without overheating or overaging the substrate materials. The use of high-pressure cold spray (&gt;500 psi) has been shown to be capable of producing coatings of superior mechanical strength and adhesion (&gt;10 ksi), making it suitable for some structural applications. Furthermore, the cold spray coating can be specifically tailored to meet the corrosion requirements of the components, through an understanding of the corrosion potentials of the substrate and coating. In this way, coatings of a neutral, anodic, or even a cathodic nature can be designed and applied."

This project will provide an innovative Threat Suitability TDA that uses fuzzy logic algorithms to define, develop and evaluate threat suitability. Determining the suitability for an OPFOR threat in a naval environment requires Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis; these methods can be thought of as a process that combines and transforms spatial and aspatial input data into a resultant output decision. We are extending this paradigm to include a temporal dimension as a specific type of aspatial domain. The algorithm will utilize all available sources and types of relevant data, to include environmental, historical, intelligence estimates and tactical situation; and harmonize disparate data representations by transliterating or rendering that data into a common geo-temporal representation as needed. The project?s key deliverable will define concepts, requirements and algorithms in order to develop a useful ASW threat suitability and likelihood evaluation tactical decision aid for the U.S. Navy."

        "abstract": "According to a report on Navy Programs published in January of 2014, ?data from the recent developmental testing suggest that reliability may not have improved sufficiently to enable a Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) with two Remote Multi-Mission Vehicles (RMMVs) onboard to complete the desired area search without having to return to port more often than currently planned and desired to obtain replacements.? An accurate assessment of achieved RMMV reliability cannot be made until the RMS is tested under operationally realistic end-to-end minehunting missions.? The accurate assessment of achieved reliability is dependent upon an understanding of the causes of component failures within the RMMV. This SBIR addresses the problem of accurate assessment by developing a Prognostic Monitoring and Condition Reporting System that uses existing or new sensors, prognostic software, and Condition Base Maintenance Plus (CBM+) techniques."

        "abstract": "As unmanned vehicles (UxVs) become an increasingly integral part of the US Navy, prevention and mitigation of system failures are becoming increasingly critical challenges. During operations, UxVs should be capable of self-monitoring, taking corrective actions, and, where possible, notifying remote human operators of faults. At the same time, operators should have access to data and prognostic models that enable effective conditions-based maintenance and use planning. For RMMV, Metron Inc. will develop a multi-faceted prognostic health solution integrating software systems for condition reporting and fault detection with advanced prognostic modeling. For prognostic modeling, data on failures, degradation, and stressors collected through testing, maintenance, and during operations will be combined with physical and\/or empirical models. For fault monitoring, conditions data will be collected autonomously during operations and be available to on-board systems and off-board operators. Off-board analysis tools will then enable visual and quantitative assessments, while on-board mitigation software will enable continued operations under degrading, but non-catastrophic, faults. Overall, this RMMV health solution will ensure system reliability and availability are maximized, maintenance and repair schedules are optimized, and failures experienced during operations are effectively managed."

It consists of modular pods that provide the flexibility of using different sensing approaches on a VTUAV. Different pods perform different functions, such as tethering acoustic and MAD sensors and launching expendable sonobuoys. A VTUAV can perform the following tasks in any sequence: (1) deploy the dipping sonar, (2) deploy the MAD sensor, and (3) launch expendable sonobuoys. In Phase I, POC will develop the CADAMASS design and, via simulation and analytical modeling, demonstrate its feasibility to meet all the Navy requirements. We will develop the acoustic and MAD data fusion for ASW. In Phase II, POC will develop a CADAMASS prototype and evaluate it in simulated environments. We will combine the data generated from simulated testing of the acoustic and MAD sensors to evaluate the data fusion analysis. In addition, we will develop a Phase III development plan to transition CADAMASS to Navy use by using the Dawnbreaker Navy Transition Assistance Program."

The C variant of the MQ-8 offers much higher endurance and payload capacity than prior versions, enabling new missions.

(PSI) has recently developed a low cost, low size, weight and power alkali atom total field magnetometer for air ASW. In addition, PSI is developing the secure\/scalable acoustic signal processor (SSASP) under multiple, synergistic SBIR programs. In this program, PSI proposes to merge acoustic and MAD sensors, and fuse the resulting contact data to detect, localize, and track threat submarines from the MQ-8C Firescout using the SSASP as the fusion processing platform. The program leverages PSI?s prior efforts in MAD sensor development, acoustic signal processing, and tracker development and other ongoing Navy R&amp;D efforts for relevant component technologies."

The application of this new switch covers temperatures ranging from -225 ?C to 150 ?C, a temperature range not covered by commercial devices. The main limiting factor of commercial switch solutions is the packaging material around and connecting to the semiconductor die. To allow for extreme high and low temperature operation, Mainstream proposes a compact GaN switch module utilizing materials that decrease material stackup thermal resistance, the number of dissimilar material interfaces, and increases module lifetime. With the inclusion of GaN devices, the module will also be capable of switching frequencies in excess of 200 kHz reducing power system magnetic and filter requirements and enabling an increase in system power density. In Phase I. Mainstream will complete the design and testing of the GaN switch module and the development of a physics based model for use in power conversion design. In Phase II, Mainstream will use the custom GaN switch module to demonstrate a full-scale prototype extreme temperature power converter on a simulated naval power system."

Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) with specially designed and fabricated manipulator arms can meet this objective. Boston Engineering and our partner Worcester Polytechnic Institute propose to develop bio-inspired soft robotic manipulators and grippers for use with UUV platforms, providing a remotely operated EOD system. In Phase I we will conduct engineering trade studies to select the best materials, finalize component designs, and predict overall system designs to neutralize EOD and WBIED threats. Specific manipulator designs will address multiple task demands and coordination. The arms will interact with a hovering platform and specially designed interfaces between the platform and the manipulators. Designs for end grippers will be developed, leveraging the same elastomeric actuation technology. In Phase II Boston Engineering will design, fabricate, test, and refine prototype manipulators and grippers in a complete UUV system that demonstrates the ability to conduct EOD tasks to allow robotic neutralization of mines and WBIED, keeping divers and operators at a safe distance. Boston Engineering will develop a path to commercialization and transition to the fleet."

        "abstract": "Otherlab has developed significant capability in the design and construction of inflated structures and actuators. These systems revolutionize robotics by lifting significantly more than they weigh, robustly gripping objects with simple grabbers, providing compliance under load to avoid damage to self or the environment, and still executing precision manipulation. In addition, the low weight and extremely low cost materials and methods used for construction make them attractive replacements for traditional manipulator technology. Their compliance both allows them to be used safely around humans and to interact with the environment with inherently gentle touch and pressure sensitive control. The Otherlab technology will now be leveraged to build marine manipulators to enhance the capabilities of autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles. Otherlab will develop nearly neutrally buoyant elastomeric manipulators capable of using ambient sea water for working fluid to lift and grasp objects under water. These manipulators will be introduced to the market space with the intention of addressing needs for very light and small volume components required for AUVs, which by nature need to conserve power and therefore minimize weight and drag. The manipulators also will serve as lower cost, high capability ROV arms."

The vehicles will perform short duration missions (~20 ? 30 minutes) at high Mach numbers (~ 10). At these flight speeds the aerodynamically heated vehicle structure is a potential high temperature source for running a heat engine to produce power. Physical Sciences Inc., collaborating with the Boeing Company, proposes a novel hypersonic flow energy scavenging approach. It is based on solid state devices that operate at ~1000 - 1500 K, and convert thermal energy to electrical energy at efficiency &gt; ~ 35%. The devices have ~ 5X the energy density of thermoelectrics for the same mission duration. They can be integrated as thin lightweight tiles behind the hot vehicle structure. Under Phase I Baseline, we will develop thermal designs for the devices via modeling and key laboratory experiments, with further optimization and experimental validation under Phase I Option. The Boeing Company will analyze design tradeoffs for device integration into hypersonic vehicles. In Phase II prototype devices will be developed and demonstrated in relevant thermal and mechanical environments."

A thermoelectric (TE) energy-harvesting system converts thermal energy into electricity by taking advantage of the temperature difference between two surfaces. The objective of this effort is to increase the temperature limits of current TE materials from approximately 600 ?C to 1250 ?C while achieving a figure of merit (ZT) above 1. During Phase I we will develop thermoelectric generator concepts using thermally stable silicon carbide nanofibers. The nanofibers will be aligned and encapsulated in thermally stable aerogel to insulate the hot from the cold side and improve the figure of merit. The materials will be characterized by determining electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and the Seebeck coefficient as a function of temperature up to the expected maximum use temperature. We will develop predictions of expected TE figure of merit and thermoelectric efficiency. If awarded a Phase I Option, the materials will be characterized by SEM and TEM to image grain and lattice structure of materials heated to a maximum of 1250 ?C and the images will be used to understand the morphology and structure of the TE devices."

        "abstract": "The Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) effort will bring about a new era in the Department?s implementation of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and advanced health care delivery approaches. The advent of EMRs has provided better access into the workings of health care systems, but has not necessarily empowered patients and practitioners with better decision making ability. Simply providing access to form-based records presents patients and doctors with limited understanding of past, current, and future conditions that can influence treatment plans or impact the effectiveness of the care provided. EMRs brings about three exciting opportunities for better health management: communication through mobile devices, dynamic treatment plans, and analytics. On mobile devices, the opportunity is provide two-way, real-time communication that can lead to better decisions, both by patients and practitioners. On treatment plans, the opportunity is the evaluation of status updates and clinical notes against digitized treatment plans instead of the current treatment plans buried in paper documents. On analytics, the harvesting of lessons learned from frequent user updates and evaluation in dynamic plans against expected objectives for the benefit of practitioners and patients. These opportunities represent the focus areas of Milcord?s Medical Informatics Decision Assistance and Support capability."

        "abstract": "The marine environment is extremely corrosive to turbine engine components due to salt exposures from the sea, the presence of fuel impurities and the high temperatures experienced. To cope with future operational requirements, a strong need exists to develop novel, protective coatings to provide environmental protection from hot corrosion and oxidation conditions across a wide range of operating temperatures. To address this issue, this program will employ novel compositions and advanced processing methods to apply corrosion-resistant coatings onto marine turbine engine components such as blades and vanes. Integrated Computational Materials and Engineering (ICME) techniques will be used to aid compositional development by assessing the compatibility of the coating(s) with substrate alloys in terms of the activity matching of key components and determining the thermodynamics of multi-salt sulfate deposits to assess their liquidus temperature and stability with alumina and\/or chromia scales. DVTI will use its production scale coater to apply the selected coatings onto test samples to demonstrate the desired composition, microstructure and non-line-of-sight coating deposition capability. Samples will then be tested for their resistance to Type I and II hot corrosion and oxidation degradation under dual-cycle conditions intended to duplicate the hot corrosion and oxidation damage found in practice."

Salt-deposit-induced hot corrosion in particular has become an intensive area of emphasis for OEMs, as at increased temperatures, combined with mechanical stresses, new chemical reactions with both environmental coatings and metal substrates creates an accelerated corrosion condition. In order to provide a more complete solution for both oxidation and hot corrosion performance of IBC Materials and Technologies in conjunction with our industry partners Rolls-Royce Corporation, CompuTherm LLC, and Purdue University, will develop a revolutionary new protective coating based on the Plasma Electrolytic Diffusion (PED) process. The PED process will yield an improved diffusion and oxide layer capable of improved resistance to Type I and II hot corrosion, oxidation, and mechanical stresses for advanced aero-derivative marine propulsion systems. The focus of IBC?s effort is to create and understand unique, non-equilibrium surface chemistries and microstructures that provide superior oxide layers and increase resistance to oxidation, hot corrosion, and coating\/substrate interface issues. PED processing will be used to treat disk\/blade alloy substrates for hot corrosion testing."

        "abstract": "The United States Department of Defense (DoD) is facing a time when budgets are shrinking as the number of volatile and hostile nations around the world grows. Offensive mining is a potentially low-cost solution that allows the US to apply pressure to hostile nations. Traditional minefields are created using manned delivery platforms that could be used elsewhere in the war effort. New technologies, such as the Advanced Undersea Weapons System (AUWS), will use unmanned vehicles (UxVs) for clandestine placement of sensors and weapons and will provide solutions that blend human and autonomous controls for minefield deployment and activation, and enable precision placement of sensors and mines using onboard GPS coordinate tracking. Current models for planning offensive minefields require human interaction between stand-alone models; this makes it difficult to incorporate new data and replan quickly. Here, Metron proposes to create a new offensive mine planning software solution that will allow for incorporation of outside data and assessment of plans createdusing stakeholder measures of effectiveness (MOE)."

The Aerophase multi-fuel shelter heater will use a wide variety of energy sources that are often available in locations where shelters are deployed. This will reduce risk associated with transportation and storage of liquid fuels. Currently, the Marines use soft-wall shelter heaters that only burn liquid fuels. These fuels require transportation by convoy putting Marines at greater risk. The proposed heater will further reduce risk to Marines with a high efficiency heater that minimizes local fuel transportation and eliminates smoke signature from solid fuel combustion. The proposed Phase I feasibility project will demonstrate combustion of liquid, gas, and solid fuels along with electric heating option integrated into one portable forced air circulating shelter heater. The great challenge in this project is integrating solid fuel combustion from energy sources like coal, wood, wood pellets\/chips, agricultural waste, and shredded trash, without smoke. The new multi-fuel heater will address many important issues such as a heat exchanger that is compatible with fly-ash from biomass combustion and controlled combustion that is critical for high efficiency operation."

These convoys are targets of opportunity for enemy attacks and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), placing Marines at risk. Accordingly, they wish to develop a multi-fuel heating system to reduce their dependence on liquid fuels and their associated risks. We propose to develop a multi-fuel system that burns liquid, gaseous fuel and wood pellets. This will be accomplished by using the current HDT Military Tactical Heater as a platform and modifying to accomplish the following: 1) addition of an innovative solid fuel burner with a wood pellet hopper and feeder; 2) replacing the current liquid fuel burner with a dual fuel liquid\/gas burner; 3) improving the delivery of heat to the softwall shelters and 4) improving the auxiliary system with state-of-the-art thermostats and temperature controllers and high energy density batteries. Some of these modification will increase the weight and volume of the system while others will reduce it. We will ensure the net effect is consistent with the overall requirements of the Marine Corps."

Triton proposes to design, analyze and develop a lightweight and durable exhaust system using a high temperature composite material system that will be less expensive to acquire while still meeting performance specifications and being robust enough to withstand the demanding operating environments. The exhaust system concept will minimize the thermal transfer from the hot exhaust gases to the external surfaces. The temperature of the exposed surfaces of the exhaust system will match the temperature of the surrounding vehicle surface."

        "abstract": "A major challenge facing designers of exhaust and thermal management systems is to increase exhaust transport, heat transfer and dissipation capability, while reducing weight penalties and improving component lifecycle. Currently, the demand for increased exhaust and heat removal in military vehicles is surpassing the performance limits of conventional exhaust and thermal management systems. The main reason is updated military vehicles include additional armor protection, sensors, firepower, and other advanced capabilities that have added weight and higher performance requirements on the system components. The USMC experienced exhaust system challenges on the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV). The aluminum and composite design developed to meet the exhaust requirements of the 2800 hp diesel enginepeformed poorly and came at a substantial weight and cost penalty. As the USMC begins to look at future amphibious assault vehicle (AAV) designs, it is seeking to develop a light-weight, lower-cost vehicle exhaust system that can withstand the repeated heating\/cooling cycles under exposure to the aggressive saltwater environment, while minimizing the transfer of heat from engine exhaust to the external surface of the vehicle for improved personnel safety and reduced thermal signature. METSS proposes to achieve these objectives using an exhaust system concept based on a composite wall construction, where each material used in the composite design is selected to perform a specific function. METSS believes this approach offers the most flexibility with respect to the overall design of the exhaust system, providing multiple ways to address the demanding thermal, structural, and environmental performance requirements."

The existing Amphibious Assault Vehicles suspension system limits sea mobility to around 8 knots, three times slower than that desired by the Marine Corps. Loc Performance Products, Inc. (Loc) proposes to develop its Best Value Suspension System (BVSS) with its partner Oneiric Systems, Inc., to provide the Marine Corps with its desired sea and land mobility performance at an affordable price. BVSS provides a minimally complex approach to lift the running gear, improving sea mobility, while simultaneously meeting all requirements. In Phase I, Loc will develop two spring technology solutions and a common hydraulic damping design to offer the Marine Corps a modular architecture with tradeoff options between cost, weight, packaging, and reliability in their future amphibious suspension system. Loc will mature the technology concepts, perform modeling and simulation analyses, and quantify tradeoffs for each spring mechanism option. At the conclusion of Phase I, Loc will recommend a complete system design for a follow-on Phase II system demonstration. At the conclusion of Phase II, BVSS will be ready for technology insertion into the next Marine Corps amphibious vehicle development program."

There are many challenges with the manufacturability and efficiency of such a system in the 40-200 GHz range using conventional substrate-based technologies that support a TEM transmission line. The Nuvotronics? proprietary PolyStrata? additive microfabrication process is tailored specifically for meeting modern needs for low-loss, broadband array systems at mmW frequencies.

This engine utilizes a patented technology that offers a high power density, compact size, the ability to utilize heavy fuels, and eliminates problems with cold weather starting that are typical of standard 2-stroke engines. The engine will be coupled to a ruggedized high output alternator that offers the best efficiency and is the coolest running alternator in the high output market. GLSV has been involved in several under armor APU noise and vibration reduction efforts . As the lead integrator, GLSV brings a unique skill set that will result in an improved integration approach that will design noise and vibration performance into the base APU architecture right from the start of the development cycle. This will result in a quiet APU that will also meet the packaging, power generation, and thermal management requirements."

        "abstract": "Electronically steered antenna arrays capable of forming multiple beams enable tracking and concurrent sensing of multiple, spatially diverse targets, thus providing significant advantage over dish antennas that have fixed, narrow beam patterns. To address the needs of the DoD, such antenna arrays must demonstrate high gain, low noise figure, and ultra-wideband operation. We have identified the antipodal Vivaldi antenna on LCP substrate as a prime candidate to fulfill these multiple stringent requirements. This antenna structure is compact, ultra-wideband, amenable to fabrication using well-established processes, and readily integrated into high channel count arrays. Phase Sensitive Innovations has considerable experience designing and fabricating these and other antennas and will leverage this experience to deliver the needed antennas for the 40-200 GHz frequency range. Beyond that, we have also developed a powerful receiver technology that will complement the antenna development effort and provide significant benefits over traditional techniques for beam forming and processing of received signals. Our imaging receiver technology inherently forms thousands of concurrent beams with an improved sensitivity as compared to conventional receiver approaches. Moreover, most aspects of the our approach have already been proven through recent demonstrations of a TRL6 77 GHz passive video-rate imager developed for helicopter brown-out mitigation."

        "abstract": "Busek proposes to demonstrate a small, quiet, electronically fuel injected diesel generator for powering auxiliary electrical loads on an Amphibious Combat Vehicle. The objective is to prove that an electronic fuel injection (EFI) system will enhance a single-cylinder reciprocating diesel engine to meet the desired performance objectives, by increasing its power-to-volume ratio, decreasing its fuel consumption, and decreasing its acoustic noise level. For Phase I, a full EFI system will be produced by selecting an appropriate injector and injector pump, producing a custom cylinder head, and developing a specialized engine management system. Furthermore, this Phase I will also establish that the proposed auxiliary power unit will be capable of fitting in the specified space constraint. The proposed APU will have the following capabilities: produce 7kW of power in a 220 lbs package; possess multi-fuel capability on JP-8, F24, DF-2, and DF-A; achieve reliable operation at a wide range of environmental temperatures; achieve fuel consumption less than 0.7 GPH; and achieve noise less than 80 dBA."

        "abstract": "The psychological stress experienced by Marines has a profound impact on health and performance that reaches beyond the individual; it affects job performance, interactions with family and peers, and may lead to increased prevalence of substance abuse and misconduct. The DoD has devoted substantial resources to developing stress prevention and resilience programs to combat the effects of stress; however, there is limited evidence to justify the cost and scope of these programs. To maximize their effectiveness, the Marine Corps needs low-cost, evidence-based training options that integrate effectively with existing wellness programs. To provide this capability, we propose to design and demonstrate a portable psychological flexibility program for Strengthening Health and Improving Emotional Defenses (SHIELD). SHIELD is a comprehensive approach based on the latest evidence-based strategies from mindfulness-based stress reduction, cognitive behavioral stress management, relaxation response training, and yoga to train Marines to develop psychological flexibility and promote healthy responses to adverse and stressful events. The evidence-based SHIELD curriculum will be supported through independent and group training sessions. A mobile application using biometric data collected from sensors embedded in smartphones, combined with content delivery and user feedback and evaluation, will build a composite of individual stress-levels to guide personalized training objectives."

The VST employs 1.) the existing Aret Radar Image Processor (ARIP) to process video-SAR data and to apply noncoherent change detection techniques to identify SAR chips of potential movers; 2.) the deep learning engine that Aret has demonstrated to have detection and classification performance that significantly outperforms template-based filter approaches; and 3.) a particle filter tracker to integrate the detection, tracking and classification of the movers. The core deep learning application contains a framework that permits integration of physical understanding, prior information and will generate significant false alarm reduction. The proposed effort will produce a feasibility demonstration with existing, available SAR data and contains a clear transition path towards implementation with the APS-153."

Sporian propose to investigate SiCN based porous insulation materials, innovative textile architectures, and multilayer insulations (MLI) for ceramic matrix composite (CMC) thermal protection systems (TPSs). Sporian has developed SiCN based polymer derived ceramics (PDC) for high temperature (&gt;1400??C) applications. As an amorphous material, SiCN based ceramics have low thermal diffusivity\/conductivity, low density, high strength, and high fracture toughness. Doped SiCN can withstand oxidation and water vapor corrosion and are thermally stable in inert environments up to 1800??C. We have previously made SiCN foams for 1400??C combustion gas filtering applications. Superior to powder slurries, the liquid polymer processing nature makes it suitable for producing fully dense SiBCN ceramic structures of lightweight foam using the replication approach. With matching thermal expansion coefficients (CTEs), the SiBCN foam can be combined with high strength SiC based CMCs for advanced load bearing insulation applications. In Phase I, we propose to develop proof of concept state-of-the-art SiBCN based insulating foam materials with ultra-low diffusivity achievable through advanced fabrication technologies. Feasibility will be demonstrated."

        "abstract": "Global Engineering and Materials, Inc. (GEM) along with its team member Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) propose to develop an isogeometric finite element model creation and analysis toolkit for Abaqus. The isogeometric analysis toolkit for Abaqus (IGAFA) will be developed by integrating existing computer aided design (CAD) software with a customized Abaqus toolkit for automatic model generation and response and failure prediction using a T-spline based geometry description. Polycube-based parametric mapping methods are used to build volumetric T-splines from B-Reps for CAD models of complex free-form surfaces. An unstructured all-hexahedral mesh is converted to T-spline volumes for their applications in isogeometric analysis. The IGAFA toolkit will feature 1) FEM model generation that retains exactly the original geometric description of the solid structure; 2) re-construction of Abaqus user-defined elements using the control points without remeshing; 3) reliable 3D stress\/strain prediction using a user-defined high order function; 4) progressive failure evaluation in composite structures using accurate stress\/strain predictors; and 5) visualization of stress concentration zones and performance of design alternations without user intervention. Verification and validation of both 3D stress analysis and failure prediction of a composite structure will be performed based on existing test data collected from team members."

        "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing (AM) promises to be an innovative technology that can enable rapid manufacturing of complex parts at greatly reduced cycle time. Application of this technology to the manufacture of aircraft structural components is limited by the lack of high-strength aluminum alloys optimized for AM processing. In this Phase I SBIR program, QuesTek Innovations, a leader in the field of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME), proposes to develop a new class of 7000-series aluminum alloys optimized for AM. QuesTek is uniquely suited to rapidly designing new aluminum alloys for AM using its Materials by Design stage-gate development process, which is based upon computationally-implemented mechanistic models to predict process-structure and structure-property relationships. QuesTeks alloy design strategy will target an optimization of conventional Al-Zn-based alloys against the characteristic hot tearing susceptibility that currently limits the AM processability of high-strength aluminum alloys (such as 7050-T74).Engineers at Northrop Grumman and Boeing have expressed direct interest in the development of new Al-based alloys for AM, and will act define material property objectives for aircraft structural components. QuesTek is teaming with 3DSIM and LPW Technology to link microstructural prediction to processing variables and accelerate specification development for the new alloy. Technical feasibility will be demonstrated in Phase I using pilot-scale powder production and DMLS processing in partnership with Stratasys Direct Manufacturing. QuesTeks partnership provides a close collaboration between material design, powder development, AM processing, and OEM."

The sensor array will be made up of two arrays, a large hydrophone array and a compact vector sensor array, both with low receiver noise and high sensitivity, exploiting noise rejection in the deep ocean channel and enabling the sensing of signals via reliable acoustic path (RAP) propagation and pushing detection ranges out significantly over similar systems deployed in shallow ocean depths. Furthermore, the concept introduces the novel use of multi-mode passive sonar operating at reduced power and enabling long-life operations beyond 14 days. The initial detection mode utilizes the low-power hydrophone array that turns on or cues the higher power vector sensor array for target localization, tracking and false alarm mitigation. In addition to the deep ocean vector sensor array, STR and its partners will develop in-buoy signal processing to support detection and localization modes. The Phase I concept designs will be the basis for a vector sensor array prototype for Phase II."

The FOVS consists of an omnidirectional hydrophone which provides sounds amplitude and a triaxial\/biaxial accelerometer that provide the sounds direction.A pair of single mode optical fibers interconnect multiple, miniature, fully passive (no electrical wires) FOVS located up to 6 km below sea level to the sonobuoys Lower Electronic Module. A broadband light source from the electronic module excites the FOVS array. Each of the optical sensors, built to work at unique ranges of the optical spectrum, modulates the light within its corresponding wavelength range in proportion to the measurand; therefore the light returning from the FOVS contains the information of all the sensors at different preset wavelength slots in a wave division multiplexing (WDM) fashion.The optical sensors are micromachined MOMS (Micro Optical Mechanical System) silicon chips which consume no electrical power. The low power consumption of the electronic module is mainly for the light source and for processing the signals. The MOMS technology allows optimization of the sensors performance and low cost production rates."

The proposed device will be hard-wired to the surface of the ocean where an RF link will be established. The proposed solution will be manufactured using NexGenSemis unique laboratory capabilities to develop an acoustic sensor that could detect frequencies in the appropriate range with the possibility of extending that range by taking advantage of the dynamic manufacturing techniques available. The device will be made using monolayer graphene grown on a semiconductor substrate. The device will be capable of producing a signal that can later be processed to give a vector of origin of the acoustic vibration. If two of these systems were to be used in conjunction, pinpointing of the origin through signal processing could be produced. This device has the potential for future military application within the confines of the atmosphere, and commercial aspects available as well. The small size and the revolutionary properties of graphene will make the device more energy efficient and produce a highly desirable signal to noise ratio."

        "abstract": "The research objective of this proposal is to demonstrate feasibility of accelerating the qualification procedure described in the SAE specification AMS 4999A for alloy Ti-6Al-4V direct deposited products, as applied to the laser-based blown powder deposition process. The program vision is to design, verify and maintain control of the uncertainty in the process and to limit risk. The physics-based process modeling will be utilized in conjunction with probability theory to propagate uncertainty in the deposition process. The deposition parameters will be designed using process models and probability so as to control the uncertainty and to attain steady-state deposition. Data from the process models will be utilized with the process monitoring data in order to verify control of the key process variables as well as to identify corrective action, if necessary. Test deposits will be fabricated and CT scan data will be collected in order to verify the control of uncertainty, repeatability and predictability of the deposits."

        "abstract": "Additive Manufacturing (AM) is of increasing interest for production of Naval aircraft components. The geometric complexity, mechanical properties, and cost competitiveness for small lot production make AM techniques particularly suited for Ti-6Al-4V aircraft applications. However, microstructural and material property variability issues inherent to AM make rapid qualification of metal AM parts difficult. 3DSIM has significant experience with thermal modeling of metal laser sintering of Ti64, including prediction of Ti64 phases and phase transitions. These models have been validated experimentally over several years of research at the University of Louisville. To fully predict microstructural evolution in Ti64, accurate prediction of the initial crystal microstructure and subsequent solid state phase transitions is required. However, accurate prediction of initial microstructure is difficult to validate using Ti64 due to solid state phase transformations. To address Phase I objectives, 3DSIM proposes to: develop algorithms which predict microstructural characteristics, including phase evolution, grain size and grain orientation, from metal AM thermal histories; conduct validation of the predicted microstructural characteristics by comparison with as-built microstructures for metal laser sintered CoCrMoC parts; and conduct validation of the predicted microstructural characteristics by comparison with as-built microstructures for LENS-deposited Ti64 parts."

        "abstract": "Qualification of metallic materials is a crucial, yet arduous, step towards reliable insertion of new materials and processing technologies. This process relies on standardization and comprehensive characterization in order to gain confidence in the reliability of materials performance. Metallic additive manufacturing technologies offer unprecedented flexibility to tailor processing conditions, microstructure, and even chemistry in a location-specific manner, while also enabling previously infeasible optimized geometries. However, this novelty inherently leads to macroscale heterogeneity and uncertainties of location specific properties that make it difficult to use traditional test samples to qualify AM parts or processes. Consequently, MRL proposes a novel approach to qualify parts by inspecting witness samples that uses location specific microstructures to record processing variables by building them in synchronization with the part. The novelty of the technique is in the design of the witness samples to clone the microstructures and properties of critical volumes within the parts (internal or external)."

Use of an ICMSE process model developed by Applied optimization (AO) in Phase I will provide the basis of closed loop control by guiding the build torch power setting by comparing measured sensor data for local melt pool temperature with that predicted by the model for defect free builds and controlled and uniform microstructure. In addition to implementing the closed loop process control, MER will evaluate use of mid IR temperature mapping of the melt pool to identify random processing defects and allow for their mitigation and removal by resurfacing and insitu machining. For mechanical property management of the build, Questek will provide the framework for a microstructural vs mechanical property physics based model so that a microstructurally controlled and defect free deposit can be produced with predictable mechanical properties to allow accelerated qualification of Ti-6-4 PTA AM parts"

Currently, no A-sized sonobuoy can fill this capability gap.To develop a deep long life passive sonobuoy to operate at extremely deep depths close to or on the ocean bottom requires specific considerations and adaptations to current buoy technology. The considerations and implications are furthered when the desired buoy is A-sized, a compact system that already makes full use of its current space, power, communications and weight limitations. The ultimate solution requires a coordinated, simultaneous solution effort. The effort will move from initial design approaches to modeling and simulation activities that evaluate prospective designs associated with the power, space, weight, communications, deployment and self-noise remediation. When appropriately studied through this topic, these challenges can be addressed both independently and also as part of the overall system."

CTIs Phase 1 analysis will identify what additional capabilities must be invented and developed to support this future electronic warfare planning and execution environment. Some prototypical capabilities will be developed to show how these new approaches will allow planners to understand this complex operational domain. This not only includes seeing and understanding the threat and non-kinetic weapon capabilities, but also presenting potential interference, negative or corollary effects, potential courses of action (COAs) and their impact, and collaborative and coordinated effects employing multiple non-kinetic capabilities simultaneously or in concert. Finally, CTI will identify how this domain can be assessed and visualized in its relevant dimensions (space, time, spectrum, and potentially cyberspace)."

Advanced Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities are a critical element of the A2\/AD solution being used in ever evolving combinations to disrupt and exploit adversarial use of the electromagnetic spectrum while protecting friendly freedom of action. Sonalysts will demonstrate the feasibility of a game-based solution to model and visualize complex EW capabilities so that Naval EW mission planners can effectively develop, analyze, and prioritize potential courses of action during the mission planning process. The innovative visualizations developed for this solution will leverage a comprehensive and complementary range of expertise in tactical game-based visualization, human systems integration, Navy training, and mission evaluation software development."

NVISIN will model various types such as spot, barrage, sweep, and digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) jamming along with Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) features such as electronically steered antenna array and multiple beam patterns. NVISIN will provide the capability to visualize in 3D EW environment effects such as attack range, jamming\/interference\/conflicts and impact of weather\/terrain by characterizing signal propagation using existing empirical\/statistical models. To ensure ease of usability, the visualization of tactical information in NVISIN will follow military standard symbology. The information will be organized as layers and color coded to depict the EW environment in frequency, time, and space. In Phase I, POC will develop models and visualization of NGJ effects in tactical EW environments. The feasibility of NVISIN will be demonstrated by using a simple electronic attack mission vignette. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and demonstrate NVISIN for a complex tactical environment. An extensive evaluation of NVISIN usability will be conducted during Phase II to ensure effectiveness and usability of the human\/machine interface."

        "abstract": "While the benefits of utilizing of Expeditionary Airfields (EAFs) by the US military are numerous, there are several challenges regarding maintenance for which there is currently no suitable solution, such as the removal of unwanted paint markings from a previous airfield installation or tire rubber build-up which can adversely impact the nonskid performance. There is an urgent need for a process which can remove these unwanted materials while leaving the AM2 mat in place. Atmospheric Plasma Solutions, Inc. (APS) has developed a revolutionary Atmospheric Plasma Coating Removal technology (APCR) that can effectively remove paint and other organic materials from a wide variety of substrates using only air and electricity by producing a cold, atmospheric pressure plasma, which chemically converts the organic surface contaminants into CO2, water vapor, and inorganic particulates. APS proposes to adapt APCR technology to remove marking paint and rubber build-up from AM2 Mat material. This proposed effort will focus on development of a conceptual design of this application, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach, and ensuring the ability of the APCR process to meet stated DoD requirements. This effort will also lay the groundwork for subsequent scale-up of the process and further engineering development."

        "abstract": "Portable landing strips in the field have non-skid coated mats (AM-2) that must connect to one another and coated with reflective traffic paint in order to simulate an airport runway. Removal of the traffic paint must be done periodically for maintenance, as well as when moving these AM-2 mats from one location to another. The main difficulty in removing this reflective top-coat is in not harming the underlying non-skid coating necessary for the aircraft to land safely. Current technologies are slow and\/or non-selective. TRI\/Austin proposes the use of blasting Sponge-Jet media consisting of typical grit blast media encased in polyurethane foam coating to solve this problem. The media can be applied relatively dust free, and when combined with a vacuum system, create little to know extraneous particulate on the runway surface. TRI\/Austin will develop application processes that allow for optimum removal of typical military reflective top coats from non-skid surfaces. Testing will be conducted on non-skid, painted non-skid, and various surface contaminated with typical fluids found in the field. We propose to analyze varying sponge media, test and optimize the physical properties and application properties to provide NAVAIR with a broadly applicable new technology for the maintenance of their AM-2 mats."

Conventional surface emission with second order metallized gratings, photonic crystal gratings, buried gratings, and ring cavities have complexities in design and fabrication that need to be overcome to achieve high cw surface emission. Furthermore, wide angle 2D beam steering needs minimum element spacing of the order of wavelength which will be challenging to achieve when combined simultaneously with high power requirement. In our method, an edge emitting QCL is bonded to a SoS wafer. High intensity cw emission from demonstrated cw edge-emitting QCLs is completely evanescently coupled to demonstrated silicon waveguides in SoS and emitted from the surface using demonstrated mid-infrared sub-wavelength gratings in SoS. 2D wide angle beam steering can be achieved by wavelength tuning the multiple evanescently coupled DFB QCLs to silicon integrated waveguides, and phase shifting via thermal tuning, as demonstrated."

For accuracy and modeling flexibility the proposed codes are based on MathSys fast, high-order frequency-domain algorithms together with a number of highly significant proposed innovations. The resulting solvers will be able to accurately and efficiently simulate generation, propagation and scattering of waves within and around complex scattering structures of very large electrical sizeswhile accounting in a physically exact manner for scattering, transmission and absorption by complex metallic, dielectric and magnetic structures."

        "abstract": "XL Scientific submits this proposal to develop a computational electromagnetic (CEM) software simulation toolkit. We are a recently-formed R&amp;D company whose staff have maintained close relationships with the Electrical and Computer Engineering departments at several universities. These connections allow us to remain aware of and to apply the results of recent research in CEM simulation technology and to utilize the expertise resident at these universities.Large and complex antennas are commonly used in airborne platforms to transmit and receive signals. A variety of advanced antennas are installed on high-performance aircraft, providing radar and wireless communications. Conducting full wave performance analysis on the antennas on such a platform is challenging. Numerical techniques face technical difficulties in terms of the computational cost, desired accuracy, modularity, and stability of formulations.XL Scientific proposes a hybrid approach to simulating environment-specific gain patterns for electrically large antenna systems. The approach is based on development of a multi-region multi-method CEM software simulation toolkit that can perform full wave analysis to study the in-situ antenna performance on platforms with realistically complex shapes and materials. Our approach provides considerable cost-savings over measurement-based antenna characterization, as well as time-savings, potentially accelerating the development schedule during the system design phase."

This tool uses the recently developed ultra-weak variational formulation (UWVF) to obtain equations for the tangential fields in a form that can be solved iteratively with almost perfect scalability on massively parallel computers, which will permit efficient solution for 1000 &amp;#61548; platforms. HyPerComp is well positioned to develop this tool due to equivalence of the UWVF to DG Galerkin formulation which we have applied to many large antenna\/structure problems.

        "abstract": "Antennas are typically designed in isolation and with, where appropriate, ground planes that are not representative of the installed environment. In situ antenna performance characterization is an increasingly important task for NAVAIR as the number and complexity of antenna systems grows. Measurements are an intractable solution for numerous reasons, which can ultimately be rolled up as time and cost. Even simulations are currently suboptimal in the sense that they either lack the required fidelity or simply cannot be executed within the computational and financial resource constraints. Such simulation problems involve complex materials, multiple feeds and loads, multiscale meshing challenges, and geometries that may exceed 1000 wavelengths in one or more dimensions. IERUS Technologies develops a highly advanced high-order accurate, exact physics computational electromagnetics (CEM) software package V-Lox with proven 25X speed-up over commercial competitors on real-world problems. V-Lox has demonstrated capability to solve problems with millions of unknowns involving complex materials, feeds, and loads. IERUS proposes to extend V-Lox to operate in a distributed memory environment thereby allowing the solution of even larger problems with high-order accuracy."

        "abstract": "The objective of N151-037 is to develop a new medium weight tow cable for the TB-16 Fat Line Array. It will utilize the coaxial core and geometry of the current lightweight tow cable, while incurring a small weight increase to obtain improved axial compressional strength as well as resist damage caused by fish hooks. The new cable must possess a continuous outer surface that provides the necessary strength and cut resistance. Surface modification of the current HDPE jacket with UHMWPE, TiC, and SiC will result in a rugged cable able to withstand the 220 lb pushing force imparted by the OK-276A handling system. The increase in material strength will not affect storage on the 12 inch diameter of the Reel Unit. The improved surface of the cable jacket will make the cable impervious to damage caused by fish hooks or other sharp objects. Te proposed system will outperform the current constructions, operating in the handling system more smoothly, eliminating equipment down time. Overall the properties of the more rugged tow cable will be less prone to wear, leading to a longer lifetime. Computational simulation will thoroughly demonstrate the performance of the new medium weight tow cable."

Strength members are employed within the cable to carry tension loads. High performance polymeric fiber reinforcement is used for the Light Weight Tow Cable (LWTC) that has significant advantages over the alternative heavy weight steel cable. The LWTC enhances capabilities in shallow towing and long scope lengths for ideal performance in littoral waters. While the LWTC provides these advantages, it suffers from significant durability issues. The LWTC performs well in tension but compression loads encountered during deployment and recovery can cause buckling and damage to the sensitive data transmission lines. TRI\/Austin will be teaming with a cable manufacturer that currently produces tow cables for the U.S. Navy to develop and demonstrate new designs for the LWTC that will increase axial compression resistance. An ancillary benefit of the approach is that it will provide a means to also improve the puncture and tear resistance of the cable jacket."

        "abstract": "To address the Navys need for an innovative, low cost approach to collect real-time surface weather data for submergible vessels, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Submarine-Deployable Weather Sensor (SDWS) based on a new design that integrates POCs miniature weather sensor electronics with proven deployable buoy systems. Specifically, the innovation in POCs compact and robust weather sensor design integrated through novel packaging within a mature deployable buoy architecture will enable a low-cost, small sensing device that will accurately measure weather parameters above the oceans surface after deployment at depth. As a result, the SDWS will offer the ability to obtain real-time, highly accurate meteorological data to submergible vessels and meet the Navys need to provide timely and valuable data to support mission-critical planning. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of SDWS by integrating and packaging a basic sensor buoy prototype that can be deployed from underwater and accurately collect weather data. In Phase II, POC plans to optimize the design and implement features that allow for sensor deployment at submarine diving depths and to design sensor communication that interfaces with existing submarine capabilities, all in a low-cost package."

The system will combine technology previously developed at Aret and APS in a novel combination, resulting in a compact, low-power, low-cost system. The Phase-I effort will demonstrate the most critical technology combinations and result in validated system models to support the design and fabrication of a Phase-II prototype."

        "abstract": "This program will investigate development of a multiple beam electron gun and permanent magnet transport system for a millimeter-wave traveling wave tube for electronic warfare, high-data-rate communications, and high resolution radar. A program goal will be to minimize weight to achieve a high power to weight ratio. The program will use controlled porosity reservoir (CPR) cathodes and innovative magnetic circuit techniques to achieve the program goals. CPR cathodes can provide high current density electron emission with high quality and long life. High current density emission eliminates requirements for high beam compression, allowing concentration of multiple emitters for interaction with the RF circuit. PPM focusing offers the minimum weight for high power RF sources, and the program will focus on investigation of innovative periodic permanent magnet (PPM) configurations previously demonstrated to provide the required field shape for multiple beam propagation. If no appropriate PPM structure is found, CCR will investigate permanent magnets producing uni-directional fields. The Phase I program will include 3D simulations of potential electron gun and magnetic circuit configurations. Test structures will be built and tested in the Phase I Option. A complete electron gun and magnetic transport system would be built and tested in the Phase II program."

Toyon will extend existing clutter suppression and track-before-detect algorithms with a novel adaptive horizon contact filter using operator feedback in an active learning framework. The proposed system will enable real-time processing of periscope imagery with minimal latency and provides significant performance advantages in low signal to noise ratio scenarios."

Currently, there is no known product available to meet this need. Resodyn Corporation proposes for development a clear, tough, corrosion protective, VOC-free thermoplastic, joint reinforcement coating (JRC) to address the U.S. Navy&apos;s need under consideration. The JRC will be capable to strongly adhere to CRES substrates, and will be sprayable in hard-to-reach, confined spaces. The clear thermoplastic component will be primarily based on a strong and affordable thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) characterized by excellent chemical resistance to hydrocarbon fluids such as JP-5, transmission fluids, motor oils, etc. The resin will be further reinforced with cutting edge anisotropic fillers in amounts that will not hurt transparency. The JRC&apos;s &quot;see through&quot; nature will offer the possibility to non-destructively inspect the joint welds periodically through a visual examination. Resodyn Corporation&apos;s patented Polymer Thermal Spray (PTS) technology will be employed to deposit the resultant JRC materials starting from precursor materials in the solid state, powdery form. The PTS technology also allows for coating repairment in short periods of time."

        "abstract": "The US Department of the Navy (DoN) is developing a low cost, one-time deployable, autonomous undersea vehicle (AUV) that crawls along the ocean floor burying a hydrophone array. As these are fire and forget type deployments, it is important that the vehicle lay the array in a desired shape or let the array processing system know the shape of the array. Effective deployment of these assets require highly accurate navigational capabilities, but current high accuracy underwater navigation techniques have size, weight, power consumption, and cost (SWAP-C) requirements that exceed platform limits. To enable high accuracy navigation on small AUVs, we propose Low Cost Navigator (LOCONAV). LOCONAV uses a novel hierarchical particle filter to combine noisy measurements from multiple Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and direct observations of platform state from secondary sensors, including speed sensors, compasses, and inclinometers. This approach allows LOCONAV to model complex uncertainties from a variety of sensors while leveraging the strengths of each sensor to maintain an accurate estimate of AUV geolocation and orientation. During Phase I, we will identify promising low-SWAP-C sensors through a trade study, and build a functional LOCONAV system with software components to demonstrate the feasibility of the LOCONAV system through virtual and real data feed testing."

        "abstract": "KCF proposes to develop a system based on its Smart Tether technology which will use a series of 3-dimensional orientation sensors placed at known locations along the undersea cable to measure the 3D shape of the cable in real-time, including the position and orientation of the cable-laying vehicle. This system will make it possible to do cable-burying operations with high accuracy by directly measuring the shape and location of the undersea cable, rather than trying to track the vehicle using underwater navigation technologies which are poorly-matched to the application. KCFs self-contained cable-positioning system will transmit all position and cable shape information to the anchor station to allow simple real-time viewing and steering of the cable-burying vehicle system, as well as providing continuing position data after the operation is complete, to allow any change in the cables position to be documented, e.g. due to seismic activity or accidental dredging by an anchor. Knowing the shape and position of the entire undersea cable will be beneficial to spatial location of sensor data collected by a sensorized cable, e.g. a hydrophone array."

        "abstract": "We propose a novel and high performance compression system that can meet all of the Navy&apos;s requirements. We filed an invention disclosure for our system. A patent will be filed soon. First, for non-image data such as 1-D time series data (sensor health, thermal, kinematic), we first propose to apply some preprocessing routines to convert the time series data into a 2-D format so that more efficient lossless compression can be achieved later. Second, we propose to jointly compress the same types of sensor data. This idea was motivated by data compression in sensor networks where the sensor data are correlated. We have applied the above scheme to wind tunnel data compression and observed very good compression performance. Actually, our algorithms outperformed all the existing commercial products in lossless compression. Third, for 2-D images\/videos, we propose to directly apply X265, which is applicable to both images and videos. For text data, we propose to apply 7z and for voice data, we propose to apply Opus, which is a freeware that has been widely used in the market. Finally, since RF channel is unreliable and there is transmission errors, we propose to apply novel algorithms at the receiving end to recover corrupted data."

MAPS will be composed of a podded system capable of conducting acoustic search operations, utilizing standard A-size sonobuoys and bathythermobuoys, and localized Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) final targeting operations, utilizing modern compact magnetometers. Development of MAPS system will provide the MQ-8C and similar rotary wing platforms with a single easily installed and removed mission store with both search and queued sensor capabilities. Integration of search and final targeting sensors into a single minimal SWaP system will enhance the capabilities of the MQ-8C by freeing a stores station for additional ASW mission stores such as air launched torpedoes. Tethers Unlimited Inc. (TUI) will leverage its ongoing efforts in the development of a minimal Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) towed MAD system for the MQ-8C Fire Scout integrating a sonobouy deployed to supplement existing MAD capabilities.In the proposed Phase I effort, TUI will develop a concept design for the MAPS system, detailing component technologies, interfaces, requirements, and concept of operations as well as determining high-fidelity SWaP, cost, and performance estimates."

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to develop novel thermal battery based reserve power source solutions for the Navy Conventional Ammunition Fuzes that would meet current and future Naval ammunitions fuzing requirements. The power source must provide a nominal voltage of 5.6 V and current of 35 mA in less than 10 msec with a standard deviation of about 1ms for the first 10 seconds and 325 mA at 5.6 to 12 V for a total run time of 200 seconds with a volume of 15-20 cubic centimeter. Currently available reserve power source technologies, including thermal battery technology, are not capable of providing a power source that could satisfy these requirements. The proposed novel power source concepts are expected to provide the means to address the indicated rise time, run time and volume and power requirements. The proposed novel power sources provide the means of generating the required starting low power very rapidly to satisfy the indicated rise time and a novel thermal management technology which allows the power source to run over 200 seconds. The proposed reserve power sources can withstand very high-G firing shock and spin rates and provide a shelf life of over 20 years."

The IWCLS is essentially a telescopic ramp based container launching and recovery system. The system is very compact and can be fit into an ISO twenty-foot equivalent (TEU) container. It meets all the US heavy-lift aircraft transport and airdrop parameters. The system is highly automated and can self-erect with support from a very minimal number of personnel and two small crafts.

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. proposes to develop a unique, electrically-assisted, insensitive munition compliant, self-extinguishable, high performance controllable solid propellant for advanced thrust control motors. This novel propellant formulation has a predicted specific impulse and density specific impulses that exceed the performance of state-of-the-art ionic propellants. The solid propellant enables the development of high performance, storable propulsion systems while simultaneously reducing handling operations as compared to state-of-art electrochemically assisted ionic propellants. In Phase I, the proposed investigation focuses on the critical thermochemical and thermophysical behavior to ensure electrical-assisted combustion. This also includes evaluation of its combustion response at multiple pressures to ensure realistic system level design for high performance thrust control motors within the operational mission requirements."

        "abstract": "Ionic liquid monopropellants such as AF-M315E offer many advantages over monopropellant hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide\/monomethyl hydrazine (NTO\/MMH) bipropellant, including increased specific impulse and density specific impulse as well as greater safety in terms of nontoxicity and insensitivity, which make them attractive for ship-based applications and can significantly decrease overall propulsion system volume, mass, and cost. In previous work, Pennsylvania State University demonstrated repeatable ignition and burn of ionic monopropellants with a novel system using flat fin electrodes for electrolytic gasification of species that can then be reacted through thermal or catalytic means. In this project, Ultramet will team with Penn State to design, fabricate, and test an AF-M315E igniter with high surface area open-cell foam electrodes to enable fast reaction times with the large propellant throughput necessary for divert and attitude control system (DACS) thrusters on missile defense kill vehicles. The high surface area electrodes will be a derivative of those developed in prior and ongoing work at Ultramet in which electrode attachment and electrical feedthrough schemes are being refined. Existing facilities and tools at Penn State will be used to evaluate the Ultramet high surface area electrodes. Propellant chemistry during electrolysis while in contact with electrodes of various materials will be characterized. The Phase II project will scale the igniter and combustion chamber to enable sizing of propulsive capability and reactivity, design and build an engine appropriate for a kill vehicle DACS, and bring the technology to TRL 6 through hot-fire testing."

        "abstract": "The ability to directly digitize high frequency analog radio frequency (RF) signals greatly simplifies multi-band microwave receivers. Superconductor analog-to-digital converters (ADC) offer discriminating advantages in both bandwidth and fidelity due to very high sampling rates and quantum-accurate digitization based on counting of magnetic flux quanta. Multiple digital-RF receiver systems incorporating superconductor ADCs have been in operation for over two years in field-ready configurations at Government laboratories, and have demonstrated direct digitization of RF signals above 20 GHz. We propose to increase sampling rates from 40 GHz in current ADCs proven in these delivered systems to 100 GHz and 200 GHz. These ADCs will be designed together with proportionately faster on-chip digital circuits and high-quality analog circuits that will allow us to not only design, but to build, and demonstrate hardware prototypes in Phase II. During Phase I, we will build circuit models and use state-of-the-art simulation tools to develop a roadmap of ADC designs with increasing speed and complexity to meet the needs of spaceborne microwave radiometry and other RF applications."

The RF environment is becoming more complex and increasingly crowded to meet the growing demand for wireless services.

Specifically, the novel cognitive radio architecturecombines intelligent spectrum sensing and dynamic waveform adaptation togetherto enhance the performance of military communication systems. The intelligentspectrum sensing not only detects the existence of active RF transmissions inthe band of interest, but also estimates its important RF parameters such as carrierfrequency and symbol rate. A cyclostationary based blind estimator isused to detect the information of the primary users in the cognitive network,which helps the adaptive waveform design. Advanced game theoretic approacheswill be utilized to model and solve this joint competitive game in hierarchicalspectrum sharing games including primary users, secondary users, persistentjammers and asymmetric information structures. In addition to the theoreticalanalysis and Matlab based simulation model, we will also deliver a preliminaryRF demonstration of the proposed intelligent spectrum sensing, waveformadaption, and resource management technologies via software defined radios."

        "abstract": "RE2, Inc. proposes to develop the Underwater Dual ManipulatorInflatable (UDMI), a low-cost inflatable manipulator to assist Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Divers in dismantling underwater IEDs and mines using unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). The UDMI will enable the deployment of cost-effective and reliable manipulation systems for UUVs and will bring the stand-off capabilities that unmanned ground vehicles have brought to EOD technicians operating on land. The UDMI will have many advantages over rigid hydraulic or electro-mechanical manipulation systems. It will stow compactly before use, reducing hydrodynamic drag and its impact on mission duration during procedures such as an autonomous hull search for foreign devices. The inflatable UDMI will also possess natural compliance that will allow the system to passively deform if the manipulator strikes an object due to changing currents. Our proposed design, though, will provide greater stiffness than typical inflatable robots to enable higher precision manipulation for EOD tasks. Lastly, the UDMI will more closely mimic human arm kinematics than has been previously demonstrated with fluidic actuators, improving manipulability and mission success using unmanned systems underwater. By providing a low-cost, inflatable, manipulation solution, the UDMI will enable the improved CONOPS and safer operation for underwater EOD."

In this Phase I effort, Composites Automation LLC proposes to fabricate unidirectional carbon broadgood using thermoplastic binder with high enough permeability of the fabric to allow infusion processing. Particle loading will be minimum, but sufficient to bind the spread tows together and provide toughening and improved mechanical properties of the part after cure. The fabric microstructure can be controlled using the proposed process, has no fiber crimp and does not rely on local stitches to hold the fibers in place. Process throughput can be significant for lower particle fraction systems and is anticipated to be faster than any industrial NCF machine and be an ideal process to reduce cost."

The result will be a uniaxial fiber mat with good draping property and stability during cutting and handling, for use in composite laminate construction. The fabric can be made from any engineering fiber including carbon, glass, and ceramic and is suitable for various matrix infiltration processes. The electrospun mesh can be fabricated from a selection of polymers, enabling compatibility with any given epoxy system. The mesh will serve to maintain the integrity of the unidirectional fiber fabric during handling, as well as act as a light adhesive between fabric layers during the lay-up and molding process, allowing the elimination of stitching. Furthermore, it can be used in thermoplastic composites where the electrospun mesh will serve as the matrix material."

The candidate stitch materials will be used to produce approximately 40 yards of quasi-isotropic fabric and this fabric will be consolidated into plates using the API SC-15 epoxy resin. The fabric and consolidated plates will be evaluated for physical and mechanical properties in the Phase I Base effort and the consolidated plates will be evaluated for fatigue life in the Phase I Option effort. Materials, both dry fiber and consolidated plates, will be provided to the Navy for independent evaluation. A Phase II Program Plan will be generated during the Phase I Base effort that will leverage the existing industry capacity to produce stitchbond fabrics. An overall review of the manufacturing process will be conducted in the Phase I Option effort to identify areas where changes in the process can lead to lower costs and higher performance composites."

        "abstract": "Numerous carbon fiber uni products are widely used in the composites industry. These various products vary in cost, processing method, and final composite properties obtained. For example, previous studies suggest that crimp and\/or thermoplastic stitch sites in traditional woven uni and stitch-bonded fabrics, respectively, lead to limited fatigue properties relative to composites derived from autoclaved prepreg tapes. However autoclave processing can be expensive relative to methods such as RTM. TEAM, Inc. proposes to solve the fatigue resistant resin infusible uni broadgoods problem by developing a novel carbon uni construction in which traditional hot melt filling fiber sites are substituted with sites of un-catalyzed epoxy binder. The epoxy binder, a solid at room temperature, will serve to stabilize the fabric for handling but can be melted during resin infusion such that it will mix and cross-link with the incoming catalyzed resin flow, leaving a totally unidirectional laminate. Fatigue properties of the resulting composite are expected to be superior to traditional uni woven and stitched fabrics since the developed product will have no crimp and no thermoplastic constituents. The proposed solution will be compatible with existing uni fabric weaving equipment, limiting risk and reducing manufacturing CapEx requirements for initial commercialization."

        "abstract": "Modern carbon-fiber reinforced composites are superior in strength-to-weight ratio over most metal alloy materials. One major problem, however, is the susceptibility of composites to micro fractures and fatigue failure. Because composites cannot be annealed to eliminate stress risers, great care has to be taken during manufacture to avoid creating such. The US Navy is soliciting proposals for new materials that allow composite manufacture using dry broadgood carbon fiber and resin infusion. Unfortunately, current broadgoods are assembled by stitching together unidirectional carbon fiber tows. Upon composite cure, the stitching material acts as stress risers and reduces the fatigue performance below acceptable levels.Adherent Technologies has studied alternative composite manufacturing techniques for two decades. ATI has developed a powder tow impregnation technology to produce prepreg material directly from dry powders, known as towpreg. Based on this approach, we now propose to manufacture unidirectional tapes using a low-percentage of powdered binder to produce a dry broadgood. The binder will be selected to either seamlessly blend into the resin during cure or act as a randomly distributed toughening agent. Both approaches will eliminate the need for stitching yarn or resin-rich areas."

InvenTek large-format cells (15-35Ah capacity) will demonstrate the improved heat dissipation that is required for high rate (at least 10C-rate discharge) performance to improve battery safety and life. As requested, this unique cell architecture provides a hardware solution that can be applied to most all Li-ion cell chemistries.

        "abstract": "Current battery systems reject the generated waste heat via conduction to the external surface of the battery. This approach is adequate with low charge\/discharge rates in small batteries, but is insufficient in the high rate, large-format battery cells required for supporting pulsed power naval applications. High internal temperature gradients and peak temperatures reduce battery performance, capacity, and safety. Mainstream has proposed a novel battery cell design integrating an internal heat removal mechanism. The approach is lightweight, inexpensive, and reliable, providing a new thermal pathway out of the battery with a thermal conductivity 200 higher than existing options. Modeling suggests that this approach significantly improves thermal performance relative to external cooling strategies, and its potential will be demonstrated in a proof-of-concept cell in Phase I."

        "abstract": "Todays sonar operators are presented with a voluminous amount of acoustic contact data spanning a large multidimensional search space of arrays, bearings, frequencies, and time. Improvement in arrays, signal processing, and computer performance have led to the ability to detect even more contacts. When combined with high contact density and long contact hold times common at Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS) shore sites, it can be difficult to collect even a single contacts complete acoustic signature much less all the contacts. Automation, e.g. Passive Narrowband and Passive Broadband Contact Followers (CFs), Harmonic Set Trackers and Bell Ringers, could potentially reduce operator workload by providing information about individual acoustic components. However, sonar operators must analyze CFs manually to control and manage all key detections and assertions. Progeny Systems proposes to leverage our experience in U.S. Navy Submarine and IUSS Sonar Systems to develop an Acoustic Signature Bundling capability. In particular, we will combine our intimate understanding of the automation data flow and structures within the IUSS Integrated Common Processor (ICP) and our efforts performed for SBIR N05-063, Sonar Data Mining Agent, wherein we developed a similar CF-based acoustic signature bundling capability for the Acoustics-Rapid COTS Insertion (A-RCI) sonar system."

        "abstract": "Automation within current Navy sonar system implementations continues to require trained operational input in key detection, association, and contact management activities. Automation improvements that enable strides toward fully autonomous systems are required. Venator proposes to develop a Multi-Layer Association and Inference Graph (ML-AIG), a new architectural approach for signal association and spectral classification that leverages state of the art automation and builds on existing research activities. Our proposed solution builds upon graph-based track stitching capabilities, supports association based on spectral and kinematic features, establishes a multi-layer graph representation integrated with probabilistic reasoning via layered Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), supports probabilistic inferencing on derived state variables and attributes using PGMs, and enables sequence-neutral evaluation of information without enumerating or pruning any association hypotheses. The approach is therefore robust to operator inputs and edits\/changes at any time. Finally, the approach supports generation of a Common Operational Picture (COP) designed to adapt to addition or removal of information."

The primary technology to be evaluated for the Ship to Shore Connector design is the use of a Power Augmented Ram (PAR) technology to provide the added lift and thrust required for high speed, heavy cargo transportation necessary to support an amphibious landing. This type of craft relies on a combination of hydrodynamics and aerodynamic lift support using front RAM turbojets and aft air propeller fan propulsors for high speed forward thrust, hovering and maneuvering while in PAR mode during transits and shore landing. In addition, the use of water jets for medium-lower speed water borne maneuvering for on load and offload connector operations will be considered.Potential alternate vessel designs taking advantage of PAR and a combination of other technologies, such as SES hull forms, air bladders, hydrodynamic front and stern flaps will be evaluated during the initial concept development."

This system of propulsion is not efficient. It is suggested that more efficient propulsion can be incorporated without compromising the all-terrain capabilities of the vehicle. Further, segregating the functions of buoyancy, propulsion, and land traction can yield a vehicle that is more efficient overall, in contrast to UHAC where all of these functions are performed by the CACs. More conventional propulsion can increase the propulsive coefficient by a factor of 3 or more, which could increase vehicle speed to approximately 30 knots for the same installed power, or greatly increase range for the same fuel load. This proposal describes the effort to develop a viable concept where the functions of the CACs are distributed to yield a vehicle that is significantly more power efficient."

Proposed is a surface effect ship (SES) that will ride on a combination of pressurized air cushions in the rear section, a dynamic planing lift from twin V-hulls forward. Based on Harley Boat Corporations patented technology; improvements to the existing patent; and information gathered from previously tested designs, the innovative craft is expected to achieve up to 4 to 5 times the efficiency of conventional catamaran hull vessels. Under Phase 1, a goal will be to show that the design will be superior to conventional skirted hovercraft. The proposed connector craft will have far better seals and will more efficiently create the needed lift. In addition to the rear air cushions, the SES also generates lift from the dynamic the V-Hull forward. The low loss aft air cushions and the forward V-Hull work together to create a far higher lift than previous vessels. Under the Phase 1 Option, the team will study the augmentation of the SES design through the use of power ram augmented technology, such as the Power Augmented Ram Landing Craft (PARLC)."

Therefore, it is critical to develop tools, for the military and beyond, to address the growing need for stress resilience training. Design Interactive proposes development of the Evaluate, Educate, Exercise Approach to Stress Education (E3ASE), a mental fitness training curriculum and software tool, comprised of mini assessments, lessons and exercises designed to increase an individuals mindfulness and resilience to stress. E3ASE will integrate mindfulness training techniques into training packages with little cost to implement and no instructor technical expertise requirement. The training package will leverage physiological sensors and validated human performance measures to gauge trainee progress and adapt course content to trainee needs. The approach will be easily integrated into current military school houses and designed to empower Warfighters to harness their physiological and psychological stress responses. Such a training curriculum will enable better human performance under stress and reduction in post deployment stress injuries, leading to increased readiness, lives saved and increased health and well-being of Warfighters throughout the deployment cycle."

        "abstract": "To address the Navy need for a device that will monitor physiological conditions of a diver and relay the information to other devices, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Diver Operational Status Indicator (DOSI) system incorporating three major components: (1) an array of physiological sensors, (2) processing and communication electronics, and (3) mechanical packaging for DOSI to provide a comprehensive solution. The novel design of the open-architecture system will be developed based on POCs prior developments in compatible dive equipment and working with the industrial leaders including Interspiro and Cochran. Leveraging POCs previous technologies, the proposed DOSI system provides critical information not only on the physiological status of multiple divers to be monitored but also transmitted to other team members and commanders. In Phase I, POC plans to provide a prototype demonstration of sensors specifically designed for Navy needs placed at strategic positions inside a divers SCUBA mask. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully functional prototype system according to the outline developed in the Phase I for further testing and implementation of smart algorithms that predict the divers state-of-health."

        "abstract": "Orbital Research Inc. will combine its existing physiologic monitoring technologies and ruggedize them for the harsh environment of ocean diving. Orbital Research has a long history of creating novel sensor systems for a variety of austere environments including fighter pilots, NASA astronauts, SOCOM divers, and soldiers on the battlefield. Orbitals core competency is taking sensor techniques and porting them into embedded systems that function in harsh environments. Key to these successes is heavy integration of electrical, mechanical, aerodynamic, and biomedical considerations and components. For the Diver Biometric Device, Orbital proposes its Smart Goggles for Diver Physiologic Monitoring, capable of measuring a wide range of physiologic datastreams for research purposes and to inform the warfighter of critical physiologic information. Existing dive computers provide some situational awareness information to divers to ensure safety. Further, technologies do exist which transmits SCUBA and location information from a diver to the surface. However, to date, a system does not exist which provides full compliment of biometric and SCUBA status awareness back and forth between the diver and topside dive supervisor Orbitals proposed Smart Goggles will fill this large gap in current military dive computers by providing critical real-time biometric data to both the diver to aid in diver safety and performance."

This project aims to develop a device using a suite of novel sensors to measure ECG, EEG, respiration, pulse oximetry, temperature and to detect underwater blasts. ECG will be measured using previously validated state-of-the-art capactive bioelectrodes, which are capable of recording clinical-quality data without the need for skin preparation or waterproofing. Existing dry EEG sensors will also be adapted for use on divers, and the suite of sensors will be interfaced with a dive computer. Phase I will determine the feasibility of using selected sensor modalities in an underwater environment, and investigate the trade-offs between sensor suite designs and signal accuracy, reliability and obtrusiveness. Methods and algorithms will be defined to use sensor data to measure metrics such as diver stress, fatigue, blood oxygenation, and to detect nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome. If successful, this device will advance the capabilities Navy personnel, and commercialization of this technology will provide new capabilities to the recreational diver and civilian medical research markets."

Developments in information technology make it much easier for weapon systems to interact with each other.

        "abstract": "Many currently fielded weapon systems include fire control systems. Often, these fire control systems were developed as closed systems with proprietary interfaces and message formats. As a consequence, the integration of new sensors or other data sources is very costly. As fire control systems become ubiquitous, it is important to ensure that new software architectures are developed which are open and do not impose the same penalties for the integration of new data sources as legacy fire control systems. At the same time, as new sensors and data sources become available to the generation of fire control systems, there is an opportunity to make significant improvements to existing target location solutions. Target location plays an important role in todays battlefield because it allows for deployment of non-designated precision guided munitions. However, accurate target location from a single sensor location has been challenging due to the insufficient accuracy in azimuth determination. The notion of enhancing location accuracy by leveraging distributed sensors is appealing as a cost effective and simple solution. To meet these needs, Intelligent Automation Inc. proposes the development of an open architecture library capable of target detection and tracking using data from distributed sensor sources."

The new cathode material also can be used as a &quot;drop-in replacement&quot; for current LIB systems, and thus new batteries will not need to be designed and manufactured in order to accommodate the material. This battery technology opens up a new era for military applications such as US Army ARDEC munitions and projectiles fired from a gun."

        "abstract": "A CAS consists of actuators, canard position measurement sensors and a canard opening and closing system. A CAS design has been a highly dynamic, time consuming process specified by the various requirements such as its cost, weight, size, high G survivability, and GN&amp;C performance objectives.  A CAS design typically involves several iterations of the processes of selecting actuators and sensors, revising the designs of mechanical components and control software to incorporate changes in mechanical, electrical, and software configurations of a projectile and its production requirements. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop a method that can reconfigure a CAS design to systematically incorporate changes in hardware and software design specifications, which will enable rapid development of a gun-launched precision projectile and lead to significant cost reduction and performance enhancement. Mid proposes to meet this goal by developing a set of analytical models that accurately characterize actuation systems with sufficient scaling parameters to meet the Armys goals."

This projectile will contain miniature control and actuation systems, a surveillance system to provide real-time video, and an autopilot system for autonomous operation. Flexible circuits will be used to mount and connect the electrical components of the projectile. Due to the small size and flexibility of flexible circuits, they will be mounted in a manner that will save considerable space inside of the projectile. The lower mass and secure mounting of flexible circuits will also prevent damage to electrical components during launch. All components will be designed and tested to withstand launch parameters of 4,000 psi and 22,000 Gs. This project will utilize innovative methods to miniaturize electrical systems components including, but not limited to: reconstruction of circuits on a flexible medium, developing a flexible circuit wiring harness, secure mounting of a flexible circuit to the curved inner surface of the projectile, and the use of flexible circuits as antennae."

This would be accomplished by analyzing the required electronic components of a 40mm guided projectile and to develop a design where at least part of these components will be integrated onto a flexible biodegradable substrate, developing candidate polymer materials and then develop strategies for integrating the silicon IC dies onto the final flexible printed circuit board formed by the biodegradable polymer. A technical plan for developing the final prototype system will be drafted for Phase II."

The system can collect hemispherical images with potentially gigapixel resolution with a standard commercial frame rate of 30 fps or better. Innovative computational imaging algorithms will provide sharp imaging over the entire depth of field of the scene at every frame. In phase I DFC will analyze the device design for it imaging efficiency and assemble and test a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate feasibility.

Accomplishing this task with a single, high-definition, hemispherical imaging system can increase a soldier&apos;s survivability and lethality. There is a considerable need to develop an imaging system that can yield low distortion imagery while achieving low size, weight, and power criteria. Vecna proposes OmniEye, a camera for acquiring high-definition imagery for omnidirectional situational awareness. OmniEye achieves a hemispherical field-of-view by digitally compositing, in real-time, multiple images acquired from 17 calibrated image sensors. At the size of a quarter coin, OmniEye delivers 5 megapixel color spherical images at 30 frames per second. OmniEye corrects image distortion and aberrations in software by leveraging mobile GPUs. OmniEye features an intelligent frame grabbing mechanism that selects individual sensors in the array based on the viewing region. This capability significantly reduces the data transfer rate and processing requirements. When coupled with a VR display, this mechanism enables fast, responsive digital pan-tilt-zoom capabilities determined by the user&apos;s gaze direction. Also, OmniEye features a saliency detection module cues a user&apos;s attention to areas of interest in the view sphere using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for object detection and tracking."

The main goal of Phase I is to demonstrate feasibility of prototypes with  deformation rates as RP#1, and  known\/controllable composition, microstructure and mechanical properties. POLYMERights polyester polysulfides (PEPS) show great potential as binders for BBMs. PEPS are flexible and pliable; their viscosity is weakly correlated with temperature, they are non-thixotropic, highly ageing resistant, and keep mixtures viscosity unchanged over broad temperatures range. PEPS are non-hazardous and environmentally-safe, with NFPA ratings Health 0, Flammability 1, Reactivity 0. POLYMERight has already conducted a demonstration trial to ensure that the proposed BBM composition is feasible. PEPS binders, fillers, and their ratios were selected randomly. BBMs were tested at 24C alongside with RP#1 at 38C. BBMs have demonstrated performance that is very close to RP#1, with weak penetration depth\/temperature dependency, proving feasibility of achieving the goals of the project. POLYMERight will select best candidates for binders, fillers and plasticizers and establish the components ratio to best approximate the RP#1properties; then conduct all required testing and ensure that the formulation can serve as a prototype for a new generation of BBM."

        "abstract": "Roma Plastilina #1, (RP#1), clay has been used as an industry standard recording medium for body armor testing that stems as far back as 1977. The use of RP#1 is also labor intensive, often requiring four (4) or more hours to pack in calibration box, and then routinely followed by an x-ray to identify unwanted voids. Prior to ballistic armor testing, the RP#1 is heat conditioned and calibrated using a sphere-drop. Ballistic armor tests typically consist of 6 or 12 shots, followed by RP#1 calibration re-check to validate the results. If results from the post-test validation drop test fail, the associated ballistic armor tests are considered baseless. METSS proposes to develop a new, stable, uniform and consistent ballistic backing material with a controllable formulation and mechanical behavior characteristics capable of passing the standard column drop calibration test at room temperature. In order to accomplish this, an initial, key-property characterization and rheological understanding of the existing ballistic backing material is necessary. Specifically, METSS has identified starting base materials and at least eight (8) key, laboratory-scale dynamic tests that will be adapted to fully characterize the existing ballistic backing material RP#1."

The approach will combine Nokomis existing receiver sensitivity technologies with a novel integrated front end module that specifically mitigates the conditions associated with communication under the canopy. Software and hardware components will be assembled and integrated into a demonstration prototype of the technology, and the prototype will be demonstrated to the government. This proposed system, the Self-Optimizing Radio Transceiver Integrated Enhancement (SORTIE), will be a light-weight, rugged, and modular capability that is compatible with existing communications systems (including AN\/PRC-150, AN\/PRC-155, GPS, JTRS, and cellular operation), allowing them to maintain open lines of communication even under heavily occluded under-canopy environments."

        "abstract": "Military operations are complex, multi-faceted actions requiring continuous, acute awareness of the battlespace, emerging threats, and blue force status. Order generation and distribution are well-defined tasks within the Mission Command (MC) cycle, benefiting from decades of experience captured in frequent doctrine refinements. However, best practices for observing actions and interpreting effects have not kept pace with advances in computing resources available to todays Commanders. As a result, while assessments are performed and lessons learned are captured, these often fail to occur within operationally meaningful timeframes, delaying recognition and application of critical context useful for the re-planning process. To modernize this process and keep pace with current operational tempos, we propose to design and demonstrate a Toolkit for Evaluating Mission Performance and Effectiveness of Small Teams (TEMPEST). TEMPEST will provide end-to-end evaluation support via three key components: (1) a library of metrics that provide action-indication exemplars to rapidly select mission-specific indicators that can effectively be used for evaluation; (2) intuitive authoring tools for both customizing and developing metrics for evolving mission and MC scenarios and capabilities; and (3) an Automated Document Parser that leverages existing mission status report documentation to automatically monitor and provide status updates on relevant metrics."

We propose to develop a user-friendly mathematical model of human spatial orientation perception for applications in piloted aerospace vehicles. Specifically, the model will build upon the latest state-of-the-art models, and will be incorporated into a software platform that supports 1) easy entry of motion cue data by non-expert users, possibly from limited datasets, 2) intuitive graphical aids for visualization of both aircraft and head orientation and predicted orientation perceptions, 3) fundamental advancements in the types of sensory cues included in the model (e.g. somatosensory, tactile, or visual attitude indicator) and their integration. Such a model could be used offline to aid in the investigation of commercial and military aviation mishap analysis, especially for mishaps where the pilot is unable to give a firsthand account of the accident, or used in real-time as part of a new countermeasure system for spatial disorientation (SD)."

        "abstract": "Successful brake system performance during long mountain descents is critical. Prior test events can fail to successfully replicate the severity of the extended down grade conditions, leading to recognition that definition of successful operational tests is required. Therefore the development of an updated test procedure and development of a Brake Fade Warning System, both of which rely on a number of technical objectives is described herein. The final solutions must accommodate a variety of brake systems and therefore must consider various vehicle platforms and the amount of energy required to bring the system to a successful and safe stop after completion of the extended down grade operations. New vehicle designs have substantially improved on vehicle sensor communication (SAE J1939) enabling integration of a brake fade warning system providing appropriate information to vehicle operators using the existing CAN architecture. A fully developed warning system would be applicable to commercial vehicle systems, improving safety by replacing the FHWA\/FMCSR\/ATA recommended brake snub approach. By developing this system with legacy DoD vehicles as well as new commercial vehicles and the associated technology in mind there is significant benefit to the conduct of this project."

        "abstract": "Integrated Adaptive Applications (IAA), Inc., in collaboration with Delphi Automotive Systems, LLC, proposes a networked automotive radar processing system. The system utilizes multiple Delphis mid-range radar (MRR) units to enhance the capabilities of each individual MRR unit, while still maintaining the low-cost advantage. Specifically, by deploying multiple MRR units in a networked fashion, a forward-looking system, for example, can have a virtual array with an aperture length that is up to twice the front bumper length, making it possible to achieve an extremely fine azimuth angular resolution. The significantly improved azimuth discrimination capability allows for much improved object sizing and classification abilities, as well as for enhanced detection range. We further propose to devise a robust high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation method and a self-calibration method. The proposed DOA estimation method can achieve further improved angular resolution while significantly suppressing the sidelobe levels. It works with few or even a single snapshot, and is robust against the challenging source-coherence problem, which causes many array processing algorithms in the literature to fail completely. The self-calibration method can refine and update the array calibration weights automatically without the requirement of any additional hardware or the need of interrupting the radar operation."

        "abstract": "The Army often operates in environments with limited visibility, due to smoke, dust, fog, or other visual obscurants, resulting in loss of situational awareness. In some circumstances, the Army may create such environments to provide a tactical advantage over adversaries. In these situations it is necessary to supplement visual data with reliable sensors that can penetrate obscurants. Furthermore, there exists a specific need for collision avoidance sensors for assets operating in such environments. Although these technologies exist they lack the range, field of view and object discrimination required by Army operations. Phase Sensitive Innovations (PSI) proposes a novel solution based on flexible antennas on liquid crystal polymer (LCP) that conforms to the shape of a vehicle, enabling larger antennas or antenna arrays with significantly improved performance and minimal cost. PSI has a wealth of experience in LCP design and developing see-through mmW technologies. We recently demonstrated a passive imager at 77GHz for Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) mitigation during helicopter landing and the knowledge gained will be leveraged for the currently proposed effort. In this effort we will design (Phase I) and demonstrate (Phase II) a reliable, low cost, mmW detection and collision avoidance system for vehicles which operate in DVE."

        "abstract": "Tibia and lower leg injuries are a major concern in underbody blast events which have been identified as one of the most common causes of war time lower limb injuries. Approximately one third of all soldiers injured in underbody blast events sustain foot\/ankle fractures or tibia\/fibula fractures. Worse yet, many of these injuries are severe enough that they lead to amputation or permanent disabilities. This problem is further exacerbated by the rigid floors used in most fielded military vehicles as they allow blast energy to be transmitted directly into the vehicle occupants. Significant progress has been made to combat this threat in recent years. Isolated floor systems have shown promise in attenuating underbody blast energy and protecting occupants from injuries, particularly the lower extremities. Applying these isolated floor systems can be challenging because they require additional mechanism and travel space. This creates additional complications in already tightly packaged fielded vehicles due to both the space required for energy absorbing (EA) travel and the additional weight of the system. Pratt &amp; Miller Engineering (PME) proposes CIMRIF (pronounced Sim Riff), the Compact, Injury Mitigating, Recoverable, Isolated Floor. CIMRIF is an isolated floor system that minimizes the vehicle footprint through its range of functionality and focuses on blast threats in the 2 to 8 meters per second range while utilizing passive systems to reliably accomplish this task."

In recent years, missile guidance systems have become increasingly sophisticated. In order to counter the increasing threat from infrared missile seekers, multi-wavelength (2 - 5 m), high power (up to 50 W) mid-infrared lasers will be required in next generation IRCM systems. However, current mid-IR lasers, such as quantum cascade lasers, can only provide up to 10 W of output power. A new optical fiber combiner to combine mid-infrared lasers of different wavelengths will be explored. Q-Peak Inc. proposes to develop an innovative, high power, low insertion loss, compact, chalcogenide fiber-based mid-infrared fiber combiner for the amalgamation of different-wavelength (2 - 5 m) mid-infrared lasers for next-generation IRCM applications."

        "abstract": "We propose to design an optical imaging system consisting of multiple transmit and receive apertures. This distributed aperture array can provide resolution capabilities similar to a large monolithic aperture without the associated volume, weight, and aircraft structural modifications. A key challenge of such a system is to accomplish the imaging function without requiring an elaborate optical relay system to bring all subaperture channels together on a single focal plane array. We propose a coherent heterodyne imaging scheme in which each of the subapertures measures the complex optical field. These field measurements can then be digitally combined to synthesize a high resolution image thereby removing the burden of physically matching subaperture optical paths to within a fraction of a wavelength and allowing for a modular design. In many tactical imaging scenarios, atmospheric turbulence limits the achievable resolution and the digital coherent image synthesis processing can compensate for atmospheric turbulence including anisoplanatic aberrations. This active system could increase platform standoff range and allow for nighttime operation. This effort will begin with an analysis of atmospheric paths and imaging geometries specific to Army airborne platforms. We will conduct wave-optics simulations to evaluate the performance of multiple array geometries under a variety of conditions."

Toyons Variable Compression System (VCS) incorporates contextual information, sensor models, task definitions, and an adaptive compression algorithm for optimizing FMV encoding for a dynamically varying network budget. The developed software will be capable of optimally encoding FMV real-time for multiple, simultaneous live FMV data streams, to support the required Army training objectives. The software will analyze network resources to prioritize compression strategies and data dissemination across the environment. The resulting output videos can be easily used for After Action Review (AAR) activities. Toyons VCS will be designed for seamless integration into the current Army training architecture, as well as easy acceptance by a broader consumer market through a targeted commercialization approach. In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed VCS solution will be demonstrated using real-world FMV data, and in Phase II, a complete system prototype will be developed, demonstrated, and integrated with Army training infrastructures."

Li-S batteries potentially have much higher theoretical energy density and lower cost than conventional Li-ion batteries, but their application is still restricted due to poor cycle life caused by sulfur loss from the cathode. Our Phase I will use a superionic solid electrolyte and sulfur-encapsulated carbon matrix to reduce sulfur loss to the electrolyte and to increase the sulfur utilization. The solid electrolyte powder will be made into thin films to reduce their area resistance. The full lithium-sulfur batteries based on these components will be constructed to evaluate their electrochemical performance. It is anticipated that the developed Li-S batteries may demonstrate desirably high energy and power density for some military vehicle applications."

        "abstract": "Although rechargeable batteries are used by the US military to power equipment used in communications, navigation, reconnaissance, surveillance and computation, even the best available commercial batteries have power capabilities that are inadequate for military vehicles. State-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries used by commercial automotive manufacturers dont have energy storage capabilities to provide military vehicles with adequate driving range, and the battery performance cannot match the high power draws needed for various vehicle operations. In addition, the lithium-ion batterys highly flammable liquid electrolyte is a serious safety concern, and the power capabilities of lithium-ion batteries decline at low temperatures. Alternatives to lithium-ion batteries are needed for military vehicles. This proposal concerns the development of innovative solid state battery systems that use a novel single ion conducting polymer as the electrolyte. The polymer electrolyte supports high ionic conductivity, and interfaces well with the battery electrodes. The polymer electrolyte also improves safety by eliminating hazardous liquids and prevents hazards due to dendrite formation. Importantly, the polymer electrolyte will be used in conjunction with battery chemistry with performance metrics (specific energy, energy density, specific power) greatly superior to existing rechargeable batteries, and in close alignment with the future needs of military vehicles and other mission requirements."

This BIU will employ an advanced solid-state, DC-DC converter, incorporating state-of-the-art GaN components. It will be compact, autonomous, capable of air cooled operation and of being remotely commanded through a J1939 CAN interface. This Phase I effort will be focused on demonstrating a prototype circuit capable of transferring 100A with high efficiency. The final system to be pursued in a subsequent phase will be capable of transferring 500A continuously in either direction (regardless of whether it is bucking or boosting battery voltages) and will be modular, enabling the parallel combination of multiple modules (at least 4) for increased capacity. This unit will have an efficiency of greater than 96% and have the potential to add significant additional capabilities, such as providing battery management functions or implementing multiple mission profiles (such as maximizing battery life or maximizing Silent Watch mission duration)."

        "abstract": "Current military vehicles use battery-isolating diodes to transfer current between two sets of battery banks, which are heavy, inefficient, and only allow current flow from the higher charged (higher voltage) battery to the other. This proposal details efforts to develop a bi-directional dc-dc converter for military vehicles to allow for smart control of current transfer between battery banks, as well as increased efficiency compared to the legacy system. Mainstream proposes a 500 A, 4-quadrant, interleaved, bi-directional, dc-dc converter that is built using high-current GaN devices. The proposed modular GaN based battery isolator unit (BIU) is developed on a multiple GaN device PCB with two interleaved (parallel) modules, has a zero-percent de-rating when bucking and boosting, and is cooled using only natural convection with an aluminum heat spreader. The BIU also incorporates a novel common mode (CM) EMI filter topology, using low-loss nanocrystalline magnetic material for the CM choke, to further reduce overall system volume and weight. This approach results in a 4-quadrant dc-dc converter with an efficiency of 94.7% and power density of 18.5 W\/in3 (including thermal management system). At the completion of the Phase I, Mainstreams BIU will be a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4."

The technique involves attaching a thermal source to the surface of a component and measuring the heat flux and surface temperature response, which along with a corresponding model of the test conditions, can be used to determine the material properties. The objective of the proposed work is to build a prototype thermal measurement device that builds upon prior proof-of-concept research and addresses performance issues that were identified. To reach our objective, we propose a series of specific investigations that include: i. Investigating improvements to the heater technology to ensure uniform temperature distribution across heater surface; ii. Investigating advanced heating\/cooling technologies and strategies; iii. Identifying and evaluating sensor head attachment techniques; iv. Development of an advanced in situ measurement device prototype; v. Validating the results of the modified methodology by testing the performance of the prototype on homogeneous and layered materials."

The time between the inception of a commercial product and the availability of that product is constantly decreasing. The U.S. is facing highly adaptive adversaries with ready access to COTS technologies, such as drones and communication devices, which were not previously widely available. In this rapidly changing environment it is becoming increasingly clear that the current acquisition process needs to become more agile and Soldier-centric. A key challenge, recognized by TRADOCs Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC), is to involve Soldiers very early in the acquisition process. In response to these challenges Soar Technology (SoarTech), in collaboration with Northeastern University and the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT), proposes to develop the Soldier Sourcing Insights Early using a Game Environment (SSIEGE) system. SSIEGE will combine an engaging, realistic and highly replayable game with sophisticated analysis of player behavior in order to allow Soldiers to explore and contribute insights to the design of future CONOPS (concepts of operation), tactics and equipment."

DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC) proposes to meet this challenge by developing the Virtual Arena for Designing and Analyzing Prototypes of Technology and Tactics (V-ADAPT) system. V-ADAPT will learn individual and group tactics that are used by soldiers in virtual battlefields to accomplish missions; in addition, it will determine the optimal actions maximizing probability of mission success. The system will facilitate rapid data analysis by automatically displaying only the most relevant and interesting visualizations to analysts and engineers. In summary, V-ADAPT will provide a solution to quantify soldier behavior, display relevant behavior relationships to analysts, and provide understanding of what behaviors lead to mission success. DACs success will hinge on our previous experience in machine learning, unstructured data analysis, multimodal data fusion, and data relationship for customers such as the Army, Missile Defense Agency, Air Force, and Office of Naval Research."

The physical limitations of the machine, namely voltage and temperature, are used as constraints, and these are related to the objectives of noise and torque variation. Electrical, mechanical, and thermal models are used to form an analytical association, while finite element analysis forms the core of a complimentary numerical approach. Final accuracy is determined by experimental testing, and iterative improvements are used to improve the accuracy of poorly performing methods. The motor will be extensively instrumented for the experimental validation. Vibration sensors are the primary means of measuring stator displacement, with noise explicitly recorded from a high-fidelity microphone. Strain gauges will be installed to allow direct measurement of radial forces on the poles of the stator to allow for accurate comparison with analytical and numerical results. Mechanical torque is measured using a dynamometer having a high sampling rate to allow for determination of the tangential force as a function of rotor angle. With sufficiently accurate analytical models and numerical methods, the original optimization problem will be solved to yield the desired control."

To provide vibratory feedback, a piezoelectric-based sensor is incorporated into an SRM drive system to sense the torque harmonics in real time. The advantages of using a piezoelectric-based sensor include its flexibility in terms of placement, its extremely low cost, its durability and ability to withstand harsh conditions, and the straightforward incorporation into the existing drive systems."

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative design that combines cross-flow filtration (CFF) and Dean Flow surface cleaning to achieve an effective self-cleaning filtration for Armys RO pretreatment. CFF is especially effective for feed flow with a high amount of colloidal solids that are commonly found in surface water. Unlike dead-end filtration, the surface dynamics of CFF does not make the gelatinous colloidal solids extrude through pores which often compromise the performance of filtration. The Dean Flow has a form of double vortices. The shear force of the vortices will prevent contaminants from adsorbing to the membrane wall. At the same time, the flow trajectory tends to push solids and contaminants toward the eye of the vortices, keeping them away from the membrane surface to minimize the fouling. The design also takes advantage of modern tubular membrane filter to engineer the flow path required for Dean Flow generation and to attain the required processed flow quality. The combination of the CFF and Dean Flow minimize the concentration polarization problem commonly found in membrane filtration."

Orbital Research will leverage its extensive experience in the development of gun-hardened electronics to develop an innovative Motion-Measurement-Package (M2P) that provides accurate measurement\/estimation of the projectiles angular motion, acceleration, velocity, and orientation throughout flight. Through the Phase I effort, Orbital will investigate effects from gun-launch that can impact the performance of the M2P, and formulate a technology plan that will provide the required data throughout launch. Through engineering analyses, candidate solution(s) will be designed and the unique capabilities and limitations of each will be identified. Functional testing will be carried out in the laboratory to evaluate the performance of key components, subsystems and prototype M2P units. Orbital will utilize their in-house High-G Shock Test Equipment to perform experimental testing of physical prototypes in a laboratory setting. This high-g testing is capable of matching the gun-launch acceleration levels that the M2P will be subjected to, providing key insight into the survivability of preliminary designs. Phase I success will provide preliminary design(s) for follow-on test and evaluation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: There is currently a large widespread research effort to develop physically and electrically small antennas with ultra-wide-bandwidth to replace the many antennas operating on communication and signals intelligence- SigInt- systems at different frequencies with a single compact unit. Such an antenna would substantially increase the communication and detection abilities of aircraft and small direction-finding mobile platforms. The leading technology involves using arrays of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). These devices boast the large bandwidths necessary for this application and also possess high sensitivity. Great progress has been made in the realization of SQUID based antennas but they are difficult to fabricate because non-uniformity in junction parameters quickly degrade performance. Especially important is the linearity which is crucial for detecting a small signal in the presence of nearby interfering signal without mixing them together. One additional concern with SQUID based receivers is that the dynamic range is small and may be overloaded by larger signals. Here we propose an alternative device based on long Josephson junctions which are conceptually simpler, possess intrinsic high linearity, very large dynamic range, and have potentially greater signal to noise. They are also much easier to manufacture because of their robustness to Josephson junction parameter spread.; BENEFIT: We propose to apply our now well-established Josephson technology to increase the voltage and hence the sensitivity while improving the signal-to noise of a Fraunhofer device well beyond that obtainable from SQUID devices. We propose a state-of-the-art electrically small ultra-wideband antenna based on Josephson junction arrays which may have wide bandwidth, linearity and dynamic range unsurpassed by any current technology."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The development of organic polymers with high refractive indices and extended transparency in the infrared has been widely investigated, as a possible alternative to inorganic metal oxide, semiconductor, or chalcogenide-based materials for a variety of optical devices and components.  In principle, organic-based polymers are attractive for these applications because of their low weight, low cost, ease of processing, mechanical toughness, and facile chemical variation using commercially available precursors.  However, one of the fundamental challenges associated with organic polymers is their generally low refractive indices in comparison to their inorganic counterparts, as well as their high infrared absorption owing to the presence of a high concentration of C-H bonds.    We propose the development of a new class of sulfur copolymers that are readily moldable, highly transparent from 500nm to 5 microns (alpha &lt; 0.25\/cm), with high refractive indices (n &gt; 2.0), suitable for many infrared optics applications.  These materials will largely be made from elemental sulfur by an inverse vulcanization process, which we have previously demonstrated using a chemically stable, branched copolymer of poly(sulfur-random-1,3-diisopropenylbenzene) (poly(S-r-DIB).  We will further build on these initial developments by demonstrating melt and solution processed thin films, windows, and lenses, while extending the platform to demonstrate self-healing.BENEFIT:Existing infrared optical materials are typically bulky semiconductor crystals such as germanium and zinc selenide, or, more recently, chalcogenide glasses which are characterized by difficulty processing and toxicity.  The primary defense applications of infrared optical materials include night vision goggles, range finders, LIDAR, and spectroscopy systems, among others.  Commercial applications of infrared optical materials include security cameras, gas sensors, and infrared viewers.  The emergence of a low-cost, moldable polymer approach to infrared optics in the short-wavelength IR (SWIR) from 0.8  2.5 microns and the mid-wavelength IR (MWIR) from 3  5 microns can fundamentally change both existing products and create entirely new classes of products based on infrared optics.  With respect to existing products, the proposed sulfur-based copolymers would enable the creation of much lighter weight night vision goggles, substantially broadening their applications and improving the user experience.  The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) would be a welcome a low-cost infrared optical material that could enable a host of new sensor technologies and platforms.  Both of these examples are potentially multi-billion dollar opportunities among which others are expected to emerge.  It is important to note that the low-cost manufacturing and processing of the initial generation of these materials already establishes the potential for a sustainable long-term advantage that will be extended by successfully completing the proposed work."

IFOS will demonstrate the feasibility of developing an innovative optical fiber based system to enable precision measurement of high-frequency heat flux\/skin friction in hypersonic flows. The proposed sensing system is based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and will be mounted so as to be non-intrusive to the hypersonic flow. In Phase I we develop a test article design and fabrication process, and sensorize the test article with a new fiber optic heat flux and skin friction measurement system. We assess merits and deficiencies of each with respect to expected performance, fabrication, and testing. We will develop plans for hypersonic wind tunnel experiments. In Phase II, we will produce more test articles, conduct extensive hypersonic wind tunnel tests, and collect wind tunnel and other performance data for the test article and demonstrate utility for computational tool application and CFD modeling and simulation validation.BENEFIT:The proposed diagnostic system will have Phase III application within an Air Force sponsored ground or flight research campaign to high Mach numbers. Initial work would develop techniques that can be applied in many different hypersonic tunnels. These verified techniques could then be used to measure heat flux on other geometries of interest, such as blunt geometries of interest to NASA, cowl inlets on scramjet vehicles, hypersonic gliding reentry vehicles (for Earth and other planetary atmospheres) and other geometries of interest to the Department of Defense and NASA."

The UMD nanosensor is a chemical sensor that is significantly more sensitive for detecting EMI than traditional p-n junction sensor. Once EMD has been detected, the platform will utilize multiple software and hardware sensors that capture similar information in different ways to identify any differences in output that could be caused by EMD.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To address the Air Force need for a realistic microstructured device with fluid shear, mechanical stretch, and an air-filled compartment, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Biomimetic Lung Toxicity Test Device (BioLTox) based on tissue-on-a-chip technologies. The innovation in biomimetic membrane fabrication and 2D mechanical stimuli will provide a device that more closely captures the unique structure and function of the lung. As a result, this device offers the capability to test aerosol toxicants, organic solvents, and volatile chemicals without damaging the membrane and is a useful tool for in vitro toxicity testing of aerospace chemicals as well as other chemicals and drugs in place of animal testing. In Phase I, POC will design and develop a prototype for a microstructure lung-mimic device incorporating shear flow and mechanical flexure and aerosol exposure. In Phase II, POC plans to validate the prototype for the ability to generate reproducible in vitro data that are representative of in vivo conditions in response to acute and chronic exposure to nanomaterials, particulate matter, or chemicals. These studies will begin to provide valuable insight into the potential toxicity of various chemicals that Air Force personnel are exposed to and help establish protective measures.; BENEFIT: Development of BioLTox will provide the Air Force with an organ-on-a-chip of human lungs with physiological mechanical stimuli that can be used to test aerospace-relevant chemicals without concerns over the device integrity. Various industries require toxicity testing of their products, including the pharmaceutical, chemical, food additive, cosmetic, and household product industries. Alternatives to toxicity testing in animals have been gaining traction due to concerns over animal welfare, as well as high costs and low throughput. This has led to the increased adoption of in vitro assays for earlier detection of potential toxicity of drugs and chemicals. These devices can provide valuable insight into the potential toxicity of various chemicals that aerospace personnel are exposed to and help establish protective measures. Thus, the development of in vitro organ mimic devices that can provide information on toxicity outcomes would have important implications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this SBIR project, EMAG Technologies Inc. proposes to develop a multi-channel real-time electric and magnetic field measurement system. The proposed system will utilize non-metallic optical probes with a very small footprint. As a result, such measurements will be non-invasive and will not perturb the fields of the device under test (DUT). In addition, the optical probes provide a very large bandwidth and a very high spatial resolution. The proposed probes also provide a very large dynamic range. The same probes can measure very low field values as well as extremely high field intensities with long standoff distances.  Novel methods are proposed to extend both the bandwidth and the upper frequency limit of the measurement system.  BENEFIT:  The proposed field measurement system will enable RF designers and test &amp; evaluation engineers to accurately quantify both desired and unintended effects of emitters and radiators on a variety of systems including electronic devices and human body."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Non-mechanical beam steering technology for synthetic aperture LADAR (SAL) is proposed.  To enable this low size weight and power (SWaP) subsystem, wide angle non-mechanical beam steering (NMBS) will be implemented using polarization grating technology. The technology will be evaluated for compatibility with a beam control system for SAL.     For Phase I Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) and our teaming partners, Exciting Technology and Beyond Photonics, propose to build wide angle beam steering components and measure their effect on the phase of a modulated laser. We will also investigate the feasibility of incorporating one of three different fine steering approaches based on optical phased array technology into the beam control subsystem.  Wavelength dispersion, laser waveforms and image reconstruction algorithms will also be investigated. Finally we will design a prototype beam control system to be implemented in Phase II.  BENEFIT:The effort proposed here represents an improvement to synthetic aperture LADAR (SAL) sensor systems by enabling their use in size weight and power (SWaP) constrained tactical pods. Several DoD platforms could benefit from a low SWaP beam steering approach. In addition commercial 3D mapping would benefit."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The effort described in this proposal seeks to develop an agile solution for mitigation of electromagnetic field induced damage to critical avionics systems. Modern sensor systems must able to function and recover from a suite of hostile electromagnetic (EM) events such as high power microwave (HPM), high energy laser (HEL) and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) threats. This proposal seeks to develop a novel solution based on phase change materials (PCMs) which exhibit marked changes in physical properties with heating and\/or application of high electric fields. Combination of multifunctional PCMs with redundant control systems allows for simultaneous sensing, threat mitigation and recovery of a critical system during a hostile EM event comprised of RF and\/or optical fields. The BRC-UD team will leverage expertise in EW operational requirements, optical and RF measurements as well as experience in materials synthesis of PCMs.  Research will focus on development of techniques for growth of high quality material over large areas using pulsed laser deposition (PLD), characterization of switching performance under microwave and optical irradiation and recommended techniques for integration into a redundant adaptive system. Materials properties will be tailored with the goal of maximizing on\/off state conductivity ratios, switching speed and damage threshold.BENEFIT:We anticipate that development and integration of RF\/EO limiting materials in modern sensor systems will have wide reaching effects on cost, size weight, power (cSWAP) and complexity of these systems. Our team recognizes the need for development of agile limiting solutions for highly integrated RF\/EO sensor systems for warfighter capability enhancement as operational scenarios and threats evolve. Our team will establish an application roadmap for the limiter capability that will establish design concepts and outline the device configuration that will be required for each application. This application use matrix will provide the basis for scale-up of materials manufacturing and determination of the production cost, providing opportunity to determine whether a cost effective approach may be achieved and what is required to do so. The commercialization approach will also address the scalability of materials synthesis, processing, packaging methods, etc. that are required. Coordination with AFRL will determine the application roadmap priorities and support preparation of go-forward development leading to production application."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Global Technology Connection, Inc. (GTC) in collaboration with their academic and industrial partners proposes to develop a software tool called Scheduling Algorithm for Maintenance using Prognostic Life Estimates (SAMPLE). This technology will aid maintainers in the creation of aircraft fleet maintenance schedules that incorporate prognostic information. Pre-planned work order packages will be generated by preventative, unplanned, and condition-based (prognostics) maintenance systems in SAMPLE. These maintenance work order packages will be scheduled depending on the desired aircraft mission schedule (from mission plans\/schedules); user selected optimization parameters; available maintenance resources; prognostic attributes; work order, job, and resource rules &amp; constraints; and the previous schedule. SAMPLE optimization parameters will be adjusted by the maintenance scheduler to generate various valid maintenance schedules for the work orders. The maintenance team will then select the most appropriate SAMPLE generated maintenance schedule to execute. Phase I will focus upon the development and validation testing of SAMPLE to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. In Phase II, the system engineering documentation for SAMPLE will be finalized along with a prototype scheduling tool will be created and demonstrated. Phase III will concentrate on creating a commercial version of SAMPLE following extensive testing through a pilot program.; BENEFIT: Unplanned maintenance affects the performance of maintenance schedules causing increased cost and loss of aircraft availability. Incorporating prognostic information on critical systems allows one to anticipate future failures based on the monitored condition. Thus, prognostic information can help order needed parts and resources ahead of time so that maintenance is more efficient. It also helps aircraft mission planners update their schedules. There are many operators of large fleets of vehicles and equipment that can benefit from a maintenance scheduler that utilizes prognostic data. Companies such as UPS, FedEx, taxis, truck shipment companies, etc. could benefit from this improved approach to maintenance. Government services such as police could also benefit by scheduling patrols to better handle emergency situations. Computerized maintenance management software developers could also incorporate this solution into their products."

Open-air arena and blast\/structure experimental configurations will be analyzed.  Furthermore, we propose in Phase I to quantitatively demonstrate our BOS-3D approach using shock-tube measurements.  Our measurement system concept will integrate with existing and planned arena diagnostic instrumentation.  In particular, a methodology to use the BOS-3D measurements to better characterize fragment in-flight aerodynamics that will result in improved data products from our existing stereo tracking technology is presented.  Our proposed hardware\/software approach will address critical explosive weapon data collection capability gaps to improve lethality and collateral damage modeling in a timely and cost effective manner.BENEFIT:The proposed system will expand the quantity and quality of pressure data being collected from current arena testing.  It will also significantly decrease the amount of time and labor required to reduce this data into a format that can be used to anchor weapon effectiveness models.  It will provide a quantitative approach to study fine scale blast\/structure interactions.  All existing Government and contractor operated warhead test facilities would benefit from this improved instrumentation.  Potential commercial applications include high-speed fluid flow applications in the aerodynamics and automotive industries."

This technique will image shock waves via their distortion of the ambient background of the arena test facility and will be capable of determining the full-field, time-resolved shock motion throughout a test.  The system will use multiple high-speed cameras which will be synchronized with each other, and could be synchronized with other data capture systems including pressure gages and break screens to provide comprehensive measurements of a warhead test. We will develop software for performing the automated BOS analysis on the high-speed camera images to visualize and track shock waves.  The three-dimensional shock wave field will be created from the individual BOS images using a tomographic reconstruction algorithm.  The time-resolved BOS analysis will allow measurement of peak shock wave pressures, pressure durations, and imaging of fragments throughout the measurement region. This system will be expandable to allow integration of as many cameras as available to improve the full-field measurement capabilities.  The developed software and methodology will be demonstrated during an explosive field-test to be performed at EMRTC in Socorro, NM, during Phase I.BENEFIT:The products developed under the current program are background-oriented schlieren (BOS) instrumentation (including custom-designed optics and cameras) and software for data acquisition and analysis.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Leveraging our extensive experience with optical hardware development and explosive munition optical data collections, Torch proposes an innovative hardware\/software solution with automated data processing and data fusion algorithms to capture high-resolution fragment imagery in an arena test environment. An innovative optical architecture is proposed to dramatically increase the GHOST cameras depth-of-focus, thereby imaging more of the arena volume at high-resolution.  Moreover, we present our concept to integrate the GHOST measurements into our arena test stereo tracking hardware\/software architecture to improve both the kinematic and physical characterization of a warheads debris field.  Our Phase I work plan will focus on the GHOST camera hardware design and the development of the data reduction and analysis algorithms.  Our proposed hardware\/software approach will address critical debris data collection capability gaps to improve lethality and collateral damage modeling in a timely and cost effective manner.BENEFIT:The proposed system will expand the quantity and quality of data being collected from current arena testing.  It will also significantly decrease the amount of time and labor required to reduce this data into a format that can be used to anchor weapon effectiveness models.  All existing Government and contractor operated warhead test facilities would benefit from this improved instrumentation.  Potential commercial applications include the oil and gas industry and high-speed fluid flow applications in the aerodynamics and automotive industries."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In order to obtain the time-tagged absolute position of the moving land test vehicles, the current practice is to utilize RF based navigation system that gets affected by different kinds of error sources similar to that for the GPS system. The error sources may typically be the multipath fading, atmospheric losses etc. The objective of this effort is to develop a non-RF based ground truth or reference system that will provide with time-tagged positional information for the land test vehicles with great accuracy. The reference system will be operational on multiple roads located in White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), NM and is expected to provide with the time-tagged positional accuracy of  +\/-5 cm\/axis rms (thr), +\/-1 cm\/axis rms (obj) for the land test vehicles in the GPS denied area. The test vehicle speed ranges from 0 to 125 km\/hr.     Robotic Research proposes the High-Accuracy Multi-Sensor Surveying (HAMSS) system to enable precise localization independent of GPS or other RF signal availability.  HAMSS make use of a small LADAR, EO\/IR Cameras, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to track its absolute pose using feature registration and sensor fusion.    BENEFIT:Work under HAMSS can leverage the localization technology developed under the UMAPS SBIR for WarLocTM. Both programs can leverage the technological advances of the other for leap-ahead progress. As the WarLocTM product that was developed under UMAPS is now being evaluated by SOCOM and other government and military commands for program-of-record use, technological advances can have a direct path for evaluation.   The HAMSS System has applications to DoD in any sort of application that requires position\/orientation information. This technology can not only be applied to guidance and tracking systems, but also ground, aerial and marine vehicles requiring high-end tactical grade IMUs. The application can span military and civilian uses for helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, platform stabilization, robotic control, spacecraft, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV), and surface and underwater vehicles."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Innovative research and development leading to a dual-use advanced technology product is proposed.  The product is a methodology and associated software for modeling nonlinear response of carbon-fiber reinforced composite materials such as carbon\/carbon (C\/C) and carbon\/silicon-carbide (C\/SiC), and design of their components.  Once developed and validated, the methodology would be used in cost effective development of C\/C and C\/SiC components, such as Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) and missile cones by the Air-Force and its major hypersonic weapons suppliers.  The proposed methodology would be applicable to a broad class of C\/C and C\/SiC components for military and commercial applications.  An innovative Physics-Based mechanistic modeling approach is proposed. The approach, based on an existing validated modeling approach for SiC\/SiC Ceramic-Matrix Composites, includes direct consideration of relevant defect and damage mechanisms and environmental degradation. Utilization of existing models developed for similar materials and building on them will result in shorter model development times and more efficient use of Air-Force resources.  Phase I will include characterization of deformation and damage in mechanistic model for C\/C and C\/SiC materials mostly from literature in order to understand any deformation mechanisms unique to these material systems.  The models will be validated against benchmark and sub-element test data.  Predictions will be compared with experimental measurements to assess the modeling approach and feasibility for a comprehensive methodology development in Phase II.  BENEFIT:  Due to the proliferation in potential applications of C\/C and C\/SiC composites in military applications such as TPS and shields for hypersonic bodies, and in commercial applications, such as aircraft brakes, the proposed dual-use high technology product has an immediate and expanding market. The biggest benefit of the proposed product is in its ability to improve the design of carbon-reinforced composite components taking advantage of its inherent nonlinear behavior. SAI will market the methodology, the software and technical expertise (services) to these and other industries."

Performing SAR and GMTI from a fast-moving hypersonic platform introduces a unique set of challenges on sensor array design, which are not present for typical airborne radar systems.  In particular, advanced techniques are necessary to resolve the conflicting requirements of high resolution, large ground swath, compact array, low MDV, and hypersonic velocity.  Technical objectives for Phase I include: (i) Develop an initial design by evaluating trade-offs between sensor geometry, radar operating parameters, CONOPs, and performance requirements, (ii) Identify and resolve radar system design challenges which are unique to hypersonic air vehicles, and (iii) validate the design using high-fidelity simulated data.  The scope of the work will include a physics-based analysis, simulations, and literature review, to understand the effects of a hypersonic flow field on the ability to operate a radar on a hypersonic vehicle.  Phase II work will include finalizing the design, and delivering to the Air Force a simulation tool to estimate SAR\/GMTI performance for hypersonic vehicles and trajectories.BENEFIT:The anticipated benefits of this effort will include a significant advance in the understanding and design of radar systems for hypersonic air vehicles, thereby enhancing U.S. Air Force ISR capability."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Luna and MLPC are proposing to develop an innovative fabrication technique that embeds optical sensing fiber into an additively manufactured hypersonic test bed. Hypersonic testing of vehicles currently being performed in wind tunnels provides researchers with limited test data.Characterizing the complex phenomena under various replicated flight conditions can be an expensive and difficult process due to the number of models needed and the geometries of those models. An advanced modular test bed with leading edge and narrow taper capabilities is needed to enable the cost effective testing of components, validating hypersonic fluid dynamic models, and collect vital research data. Embedding Lunas unique fiber optic strain and temperature sensing solutions into these cones and leading edges using additive manufacturing will fill this void in test capabilities. During Phase I the team will design and test an article containing integrated sensors, which will demonstrate the feasibility of pairing the technologies. During Phase II the team will refine the design and develop processes, fabricate and evaluate additional test articles, and collect data currently unavailable using standard methods. During Phase III Luna will scale the processes and transition the technology to the Air Force.BENEFIT:The proposed system will meet the Air Forces need for a modular hypersonic test bed that facilitates integration of new sensing solutions. Temperature and strain sensors located non-intrusively near the leading edge of a cone or lifting body will enable measurements of localized parameter variations during hypersonic flow. These data can be used to increase the understanding of hypersonic flow problems and validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. This technology is of value to the hypersonic test community, including the Air Force, Navy, NASA, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Additional commercial potential for this technology exists throughout a variety of industries. The ability to embed sensors into additively manufactured components opens the door to mass producible and cost effective smart components. Smart components will enable the automotive and aerospace industries to increase the safety, efficiency, and reliability of theirrespective products."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:TSC has been developing miniaturized, Low Cost RF seeker subsystems and RF seeker solutions for more than a decade. We will leverage this experience to meet this program&apos;s needs. TSC has been involved with several efforts over the last few years to develop technologies to reduce the cost of certain RF seeker subsystems, including the RF exciter and antenna technologies. We have also developed a Cost vs. Performance tool that provides a tool for the system engineers and requirements developers to see real-time the affect that system performance requirements have on the final seeker AUPC, thus reducing the possibility of seeker over-design and thus reducing seeker cost, size, weight and power requirements (SWCaP). This program offers the opportunity to merge all of these technologies and tool sets to see how small and low cost an effective RF seeker can be developed for missile application.BENEFIT:The primary benefits of this program is the development of lower cost RF seeker technologies for missiles that require improved accuracy and lethality. Due to budget constraints as well as the proliferation of low cost threats, numerous missiles could benefit from these technologies as we are aware of various missile programs within the Air Force and the Army that are trying to reduce the cost and size of RF Seekers while maintaining or improving the performance."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:TSC and its partners, Dr. Mark Bell of Purdue University and KEYW Corporation, will investigate diverse waveforms that support simultaneous SAR and GMTI radar modes for aircraft operating in contested environments. These novel waveforms can be adapted to meet mission requirements and offer low Probability of Intercept (LPI), jammer resistance and reduced surveillance time-lines. We plan to focus on practical issues related to transmitting and processing these waveforms in Phase I. We will leverage the CERFER testbed that is being developed by KEYW for AFRL for a demonstration flight or laboratory experiment in Phase 2. TSC has broad experience in VideoSAR and exo\/endo-clutter GMTI processing techniques from its work on the AFRL Gotcha, DARPA ViSAR and other programs. TSC has developed an innovative Optimized Waveform Generator that will be used to refine the baseline orthogonal phase-coded LFM waveforms to overcome transmitter distortions. In Phase I, our team will refine the baseline waveforms explored by other researchers, develop a flexible real-time processing architecture, address radar hardware limitations, and prepare a demonstration flight test plan. Analysis and computer simulations will be used to accomplish the work in Phase I with the express goal of conducting a hardware experiment in Phase II. BENEFIT:These diverse waveforms will enable simultaneous SAR and GMTI surveillance modes and offer low Probability of Intercept, jammer resistance and reduced surveillance time-lines for aircraft conducting surveillance or ground attack missions in contested environments. This can help circumvent Electronic Attack which can defeat or greatly limit the capabilities of advanced airborne radar systems on Air Force platforms. The manned platforms that can benefit include the F-15E Strike Eagle, F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning II and new F-X fighters, new Long Range Strike-Bomber, and Next-Generation ISR system (Joint STARS Recapitalization). The unmanned platforms that can benefit include the RQ-4B Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper and various small UAVs being developed and deployed by the Navy and Army including the Firescout MQ-8B\/C and Blackjack RQ-21A."

The sensor measures range using Linear FM ranging, and measures angle in 2 dimensions using a multi-channel interferometer. The Miniature Angle Sensing Radar (MASR) is part of a family of TSC designed and built low-cost, small SWaP radar sensors based on the principle of using a Linear FM homodyne receiver architecture and FPGA-based Digital Signal Processing to reduce parts counts and therefore decrease power consumption and cost. TSC proposes to perform specific and limited modifications to the MASR sensor to be used as a Sense and Avoid (SAA) radar sensor in small Group 2\/3 UAS, providing all-weather, day\/night, SAA performance in a low-cost, small SWaP package."

TSC has broad experience in real-time VideoSAR, NCD, and dismount target detection from the AFRL Gotcha, DARPA ViSAR and other programs. In the Phase I Base effort, TSC will investigate several innovative approaches that are compatible with this single channel X-band radar for short and long range operations. TSC will explore NCD for both reflected energy and target shadows and exo-clutter range-Doppler processing to detect very slow moving targets. Novel antenna scanning patterns and moving target focusing will also be investigated. TSC will evaluate performance using in-house measured data and simulations including a high fidelity dismount model. During the Option, TSC will identify suitable SAR image formation techniques, assess the navigation system accuracy, and develop a plan for implementing the algorithms on the APS-153 processor. TSC will also explore techniques that can be applied to other Navy airborne radars of interest. Telephonics will provide guidance on radar, processor and display capabilities in Phase 1 and support any APS-153 demonstration in Phase 2."

We propose a set of algorithms integrated via a System on Module to legacy fire control systems that will perform multi-sensor multi-target tracking and fusion, sending precise threat target locations to a fire control system in real time. The fusion algorithms will estimate sensor biases that if uncorrected result in triangulation errors. Out of sequence measurement processing algorithms are proposed utilizing a hybrid approach to ensure real time processing speed is maintained. Our fusion approach processes both raw sensor measurements and track level data and incorporates them into a precise fused threat target location estimate. A series of modeling and simulation analysis is proposed to measure and compare the performance of the algorithms across variations in sensor measurement accuracies as well as sensors available to the fused threat location."

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses a tremendous public health threat throughout the world. The U.S. military has also been challenged by dengue for over a hundred years and the pursuit of an effective DENV vaccine is a high priority for the Department of Defense (DoD). Despite over 70 years of efforts, there is still no registered dengue vaccine. While significant progress has been made in the last decade, challenges still remain. To help enhance development of a DENV vaccine candidate there two key areas that need to be addressed; robust immunogenicity, both antibody titers and durability, and shorting the duration of immunization schedule. This application is directed at demonstrating the enhanced immunogenicity of formulations comprised of an inactivated DENV and novel adjuvants. The use of novel adjuvants with the potential for clinical use will help accelerate the development of an enhanced inactivated DENV vaccine. For the first phase of this effort the technical objectives are to first screen and select formulations with robust immunogenicity and then to demonstrate protective efficacy in a lethal mouse challenge model. In this manner we will demonstrate the feasibility of developing an adjuvanted-inactivated dengue vaccine with enhanced and durable immune responses."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Platform IT system insecurity is expressible as information arbitrage practiced by the attacker (i.e. the attacker knows something the defender doesnt and profits by it). The adversary gains this knowledge by both observing the defenders system over time and practicing their attacks on similar systems or components that are often commercially available. The attacker typically has a limited set of objectives which aids in focused application of his resources. The defender has multiple competing requirements to satisfy. This project enables team sourcing of defender resources and knowledge for improved focus and insights leading to superior vulnerability identification, mitigation, and mission success.  The tool developed by this project will mitigate opportunities for information arbitrage by the attacker.  BENEFIT:  This project will produce a methodology\/tool that provides for cost effective application of cyber-physical system defensive measures."

The latter cases are called off-nominal, and can be difficult to analyze, especially if not observed directly.  Before break-up there is a single parent object.  After break-up there are multiple child objects, likely on very different trajectories.  A radar is assumed to track the parent object, but to not hold contact when the break-up occurs.  After the break-up (within 30 seconds of loss of contact), the radar collects data on at least some of the child objects.  This project addresses the problem of estimating the break-up time and the child objects velocity vectors.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

        "abstract": "Beam combining devices are extensively used to achieve power levels that cannot be reach by the use of just a single laser. To achieve beam combination these devices commonly employ free-space optical components, like mirrors, gratings and lenses. The use of free-space optics has several issues such as sensitivity to thermal and vibration induced misalignment, complex packaging and bulky design. Fiber beam combining, while also allowing the achievement of high power levels, has the additional benefit of being compact and robust permitting simple packaging and meeting stringent environmental requirements like those encountered in mid-infrared countermeasure (IRCM) applications. Mid-wave infrared (MWIR) fiber combiners are currently not available but are needed for next generation IRCM laser systems. Chalcogenide fiber offers a good building block for such device offering low-loss transmission in the MWIR (2-5um) and excellent power handling. Considerable progress has been made in all-fiber beam combiners based on chalcogenide glass fibers, however further improvement to the fabrication technology and combiner design is needed to meet IRCM requirements. The proposed effort will demonstrate the feasibility of developing an all-fiber beam-combining device based on chalcogenide glass fibers. This work will bring modifications and improvements to current device fabrication processes and design."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Aircraft fuel cells are flexible rubber-coated fabric enclosures for the containment of fuel within aircraft cavities. The overall envelope dimensions and locations of interface fittings and attachment elements such as lacing ferrules and hanger baskets are critical to the proper function and durability of the fuel cells. The existing method of dimensional inspection is to install the fuel cells in a facsimile structure and evaluate the fit of the cell within the facsimile structure. This approach is sensitive to the installation methodology used and does not directly produce quantitative dimensional data. Methods which lessen fixturing, labor, and training requirements and improve repeatability will be regarded as especially desirable.  To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations Inc. (XII) propose a portable, low cost, non-contact, three-dimensional (3D) measurement system SurfSCAN for aircraft fuel cell dimension evaluation. The proposed SurfSCAN provides comprehensive data and results about the surfaces of the fuel cell to the operator via video images for performing rapid high-resolution 3D scans.  BENEFIT:  We estimate there is addressable market size of our proposed technology. Our addressable market estimate is based upon revenue estimates from licensing, technical support and services for the customization, integration, and testing with 3D scanning measurement systems. With many new and aging aircraft and service life extending, fast and accurate measurement is becoming more of a concern to fleet managers and aircraft operators. There is no existing system or method that can make rapid, accurate, reliable, and non-contact measurement. As a result, programs like the X35 will benefit from this research."

        "abstract": "Surface enhancement methods, such as shot peening (SP), laser shock peening (LSP), and low-plasticity burnishing (LPB), can introduce beneficial near-surface compressive residual stress and significantly improve the fatigue resistance and foreign object damage tolerance of aerospace components such as superalloy turbine fans, disks, and integrally bladed rotors (IBR). Residual stress, however, relaxes with usage. To predict the remaining useful life (RUL) for those critical components, accurate and reliable residual stress profile data in the subsurface region are required. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the only acceptable nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method for residual stress assessment, which is limited to an extremely thin (less than 20 ?m deep) surface layer. Alternative NDE methods, including the most promising Eddy Current Conductivity Spectroscopy (ECCS) and Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) technology, have been studied for years, but none of them can provide reliable subsurface residual stress assessments. To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) with Lockheed Martin (LM) Cooperation, propose to develop a novel NDE tool for subsurface residual stress measurements in surface-enhanced aerospace structural components. In the Phase I program, we will focus on the prototype system development and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. For the Phase II program, we will refine the prototype system with improved hardware and software and validate its performance for subsurface residual stress measurements. For the Phase III program, we will focus on the optimization of the system performance, as well as the transitioning of the developed technology."

        "abstract": "Spectral Sciences, Inc., and subcontractors University of Massachusetts (Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory) and Corvid Technologies, Inc., propose a scalable distributed radar system for mapping debris that will allow high precision tracking inside a fireball created by arena and sled tests.  The key innovation of the proposed system is adapting techniques for debris tracking in tornados to tracking arena and sled test debris.  Innovative algorithms for super-resolving trajectories extend this technique to tracking individual fragments.  The key factor in keeping costs down is the combination of two types of radar:  ranging pulse-pair Doppler (PPD) and continuous wave (CW) Doppler thereby maximizing the use of commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) components.  A critical component of the scalable network will be novel processing algorithms.  Innovations include fusion of the sensor data and processing of the entire time sequence of the event in order to precisely track fragments as small as 1 cm even at the initial opaque phase of the fireball.  A radar system will be optimally configured to minimize opacity due to both plasmas and clutter.  The sensor network-algorithm combination addresses the wide range of fragment velocities and offers high resolution without the necessity of costly wide bandwidth radar.

The capability addresses two important weaknesses of hydrostructural codes, i) the inability to model slow fragment deformation dynamics due to the limited simulation time, and ii)  limits in mesh resolution which introduce inaccuracies in treating the dynamics associated with the smallest debris.  CDPPT processes FPC outputs with a number of innovative models.  A fast-running model based on position-based dynamics techniques replicates the dynamics of deformable debris materials produced in intercepts.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Data processing algorithms are needed to transform persistent infrared (OPIR) sensor observations into novel and timely environmental analysis and data products to enhance Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) capabilities. Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI), in collaboration with the Univ. of Wisconsin Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC), proposes to develop an operational concept (OPSCON) that utilizes the unique characteristics of OPIR data to enhance AFWA prediction abilities without interfering with OPIRs primary mission. We shall develop a novel CO2\/N2O slicing algorithm to derive three important cloud parameters (cloud presence, cloud top height, and cloud top phase) that will augment existing climatology databases. The key innovation lies in developing algorithms for OPIRs mid-wave infrared spectral bands, which are not conventionally utilized for environmental intelligence. We will also investigate OPIR data for characterizing ionosphere electrical discharges or upward lightning (sprites, elves, and blue jets). This program leverages SSECs extensive experience in cloud retrievals and SSIs radiation and sensor modeling experience and codes as well as publicly available data from the NASA MODIS and VIIRS satellites. In Phase II, we will implement the software with OPIR data, and refine collection requirements and OPSCON for supporting DOD weather and climatological requirements.BENEFIT:The algorithms developed under this program would provide immediate benefit to AFWA weather predictions by providing timely and accurate cloud data products from OPIR imagery. End products will include a comprehensive, all-altitude forward atmospheric radiance modeling tool and cloud retrieval operational algorithms and data products. The modeling tool and algorithms will be of significant value for sensor design and other government and commercial applications of radiative transfer codes. The cloud properties data products will enhance meteorological forecasting and climatology research."

The very early temporal period of this UV-VIS-NIR emission represents the brightest radiance and contains spectral signatures of intermediate compounds emitted during fireball expansion and from reactions with ambient species. Spectral analysis to identify the emitting chemical species has not been fully exploited, yet is critical to support ongoing research and development towards improved control, safety and performance of explosive materials and munitions. In particular, there is a need for a species classification system coupled to a unified, comprehensive database of emission spectra. Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI), in collaboration with Prof. Nick Glumac of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), hereby proposes to develop a complete spectral signature processing capability for interpreting the spectral signatures at all times of the explosion process from early breakout period to fireball conditions. This software, dubbed Fitting Imagery of Explosives Radiance with Endmember Signatures software (FIERES), will provide a classification system based on a database of UV\/VIS\/NIR signatures constructed for all possible species and conditions in the detonation environment.BENEFIT:High Explosives, munitions, detonation, UV-VIS-NIR, high temperatures, spectral signatures, classification, Endmember."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Spectral Sciences Inc. (SSI), in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), proposes a new approach to snapshot hyperspectral imaging (HSI), using a 2D array of Fabry-Perot cavity filters mated cooled, long-wave infrared (LWIR) focal plane array (FPA) pixels to produce three HSI dimensions (a hypercube) simultaneously in a compact, low weight and power package. Snapshot HSI sensors eliminate motion artifacts due to multi-frame collection, producing complete spectra and imagery in a single frame, undistorted by temporal lag times. They are especially suited for monitoring dynamic events, including moving vehicles, drones, gaseous plumes, and artillery firing. The hyperspectral data is obtained at the FPA frame rate. Combined with temporal algorithms, it can analyze spectral\/temporal signatures. The proposed 2D array consists of superpixels, clusters of filters spanning the spectral band-pass, arrayed in an imaging format, a concept similar to the standard CMOS camera three-color Bayer filter. SNL demonstrated LWIR superpixel filter development under a program funded by the DoE Proliferation Detection Program Office, forming the basis for the proposed effort. SSI will investigate configurations of the filter bands and camera design that support operation of the highest spatial resolution, adaptively adjusted to the requirements of the user.BENEFIT:The successful project will produce the design and fabrication plan for a new LWIR hyperspectral filter to be used with a cooled MCT FPA to produce very high spectral resolution, good spatial resolution imagery. This revolutionary sensor will be compact, requiring no spectrally selective optical system; fast, producing full datacubes in a single frame; and sensitive, with high optical transmission and low noise. It will be particularly valuable for measurements of transient or dynamic events, where video or greater data rates are required. High data rate is compatible with temporal algorithms that extract signatures of engines, and clutter algorithms that extract spectral imagery in the presence of platform jitter or other sources of temporal interference. Consideration of spatial resolution will result in a sensor that can be adapted in hardware to higher spatial, lower spectral resolution operation at the users discretion. Military applications of the filter technology combined with an LWIR camera include, rifle and artillery muzzle flash detection, moving vehicle and drone tracking, and gaseous plume detection, especially in nighttime and high aerosol conditions where vis\/SWIR sensors fail. Civilian applications include border and fence line security, home surveillance, environmental, effluent and hazardous chemical release monitoring, and industrial process monitoring."

This work will not modify the existing GPS cryptographic structure, but rather develop an overlay for providing keying information to a receiver in a manner that makes all security information ephemeral, eliminating the permanent storage of CPI within the receiver. Existing and emerging battlefield networks will be leveraged to provide a method of securely distributing keys to a GPS receiver. This technique requires a security overlay over the tactical or strategic communication network where the security overlay will provide access control based on advanced key distribution, mutual authentication, location-based access and biometric techniques. The security overlay will provide secure transmission of encrypted, black keys to military receivers through all types of tactical or strategic communication networks, including mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Additionally, concept of operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) needed to support the ephemeral overlay technology will be explored.BENEFIT:A successful implementation of the proposed system would greatly reduce the cost and overhead associated with the development and manufacture of military GPS receivers. Removing the permanent storage of CPI from the receiver would remove the burden placed on receiver manufacturers by the strict security policies associated with SAASM receivers and open military receiver development to a wide range of non-traditional contractors."

Given that the integrity of the payload and fuze components is critical to proper weapon functioning, it is imperative that solutions, that ensure this integrity, are developed concurrently with the anticipated increase in weapon velocities. Consequently, there is a need and opportunity to explore producible innovative, integrated case and payload structures that reduce movement of the explosive and fuze components during impact and penetration.BENEFIT:If this effort is successful, it could lead to a new, revolutionary class of penetrators. Our method would stabilize the payload by providing additional surface area between the warhead structure and the payload. In addition, the concept would reduce fuze failures due to internal movement, expand the ability for controlled fragmentation, and potentially allow for distributed fuzing that increases warhead effectiveness. There are many other potential military applications. For example, similar concepts could be used to control the fragmentation pattern for above ground targets. In addition, the modular flexibility enabled by our process may allow multiple energetic components within a single warhead, for which there are many potential applications."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The advent of wide area Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) and Overhead Persistent InfraRed (OPIR) systems V particularly those with broad area coverage and staring focal planes V heightened the call for persistent surveillance for DoD and intelligence community (IC) missions. Persistence allows warfighters to monitor areas of interest and catch fleeting events of tactical importance, the missile defense community to better engage threats through higher fidelity state vectors, and the intelligence community to dwell over high value targets. Prosecuting complex, fleeting and high value targets across an extended battlespace requires sensors of varying capability V temporal, spatial and sensitivity (radiometric, spectral). Multiple sensors, operating independently can satisfy more requirements. And multiple sensors operating as a system-of-systems through appropriate allocation and timely tipping and cueing, can maximize persistence. We propose to develop the Autonomous Cueing and Tipping of ISR and OPIR Networks tool (ACTION), a sensor-agnostic approach that semi-automates the tipping and cueing process to the maximum extent possible in order to optimize and speed the process to put OPIR and ISR sensors on targets of interest in time and with the right capability to contribute to the intelligence mission.BENEFIT:The Phase I effort will provide a proof of concept model and associated algorithms for OPIR-ISR tipping\/cueing that will inform the path ahead for operational incorporation into community mission management tools. Ultimately, the proposed effort will produce several important results including: 1) Development of an OPIRISR tip-cue framework and prototype model to support development and performance testing of a prototype operational tipping &amp; cueing application; 2) Definition of tipping-cueing business rules associated with sensor\/target classes and mission scenarios to support multiple mission areas; 3) Development of tip-cue algorithms, applications, and optimization framework; and 4) Definition and prototyping of a user interface to support prototype development, scenario visualization, performance assessment, mission management, and tip-cue message oversight"

The AOA performance, RF complexity, and SWAP (with current mast antennas and size, power, and interface restrictions) are compared. Functional block diagrams and AOA error budgets are developed. Calibration approaches are developed exploiting the Next-Gen EW System digital architecture. The DF module concept feasibility in meeting Navy requirements is shown. In Phase II the prototype is developed and evaluated for suitability for Next Generation EW Digital DF. The prototype performance is demonstrated and evaluated using synthetic and real-world signals. Performance is assessed over frequency, AOA, pulse-width and SNR. The impact of numerous deployment cycles is addressed. Evaluation results are used to refine the prototype and establish a design to meet the Navy requirements. A Phase III development plan is prepared to transition the technology for Navy use. In Phase III, RAS will support the Navy in transitioning the technology, including formal test and validation. Testing is conducted in an operationally relevant environment at NUWC (or sea trials) and effectiveness assessed."

        "abstract": "Ocular traumas resulting from explosive or incendiary devices are one of the most common injuries reported by our armed forces. Current standard of care protocols do not address the biological and molecular processes in corneal wound healing, and therapeutic failure is associated with corneal ulcers, scarring, and loss of vision. Ocular therapeutics that have regenerative healing properties, restore corneal biomechanical integrity and can be readily applied in the field will greatly enhance therapeutic outcome. FirstString Research has developed an ophthalmic eye-drop formulation containing the short regulatory peptide (ACT1) that possesses anti-inflammatory properties and enhances corneal regeneration via the stabilization of gap and tight junctions by modulating junctional protein interactions. The proposed Phase I SBIR will test the hypothesis that an ophthalmic ACT1 peptide formulation can accelerate corneal reepithelialization and restore corneal biomechanics, thus improving visual outcome. Using pre-clinical corneal injury models of blast and burn, our goal is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of an ACT1 ophthalmic formulation with respect to corneal and lentricular pharmacokinetics, corneal regeneration, corneal scarring, and corneal biomechanics. Successful completion of this study will demonstrate feasibility and will allow us to perform comprehensive translational technology development in a future Phase II effort."

The noise figure for both LNAs is to be under 2.0dB with gain greater than 25dB. The input and output return loss is less than 10dB with an OIP3 greater than 10dBm. The operating temperature range is -20 deg C to +70 deg C. The LNAs are to have a power consumption that is less than 500mW. The LNAs are also expected to work in a cryogenic environment and withstand a radiation dose tolerance of 300krad at Ka band and 1 Mrad at Q-Band. Our design concept to meet these chanllengin technical objectives is the use of a 50nm MHEMT that has already been developed.BENEFIT:The development of these low noise MMIC LNAs will advance the performance of DoD receivers in the next generation satellite systems. The development of LNAs that will use this technology will enhance the performance of next generation satellite such as the commercial satellite market through out the Microwave and in the millieter wave region. Point to point digital radios noise figure will be lowered to improve the signal to noise ratio of their operation."

Digital Optics Technologies (DOT) has been developing a Fast Light Optical Gyroscope (FLOG) that can improve the accuracy of rotation sensing by nearly six orders of magnitude.  Alternatively, for a given accuracy need, the FLOG can be very small.  DOT has also developed a Fast Light Optical Accelerometer (FLOAC).  Under Phase I, we will demonstrate technical feasibility of realizing a compact Fast Light Inertial Measurement Unit (FLIMU) that would comprise three FLOGs and three FLOACs, utilizing miniature vapor cells, integrated optical components, detectors and lasers.  The FLIMU is expected to be at least three orders of magnitude better than the state of the art in tactical IMUs, while meeting the SWaP goals of this solicitation.  In addition to miniaturization, a key focus of this effort would be to develop requisite components that would be able to withstand harsh conditions such as radiation, vibration and shock.  To this end, we will analyze and optimize the FLIMU design for robustness to vibration and shock, and  carry out tests of key components for radiation hardness.  Development of a prototype that would meet the SWaP, performance and robustness goals would be carried out in Phase II.  Honeywell and Northwestern University would be subcontractors.

Phase I develops the design concept and packaging of the compact IMU.  Through component testing and performance analysis, Phase I establishes the feasibility of the design to achieve the required performance in the specified flight environment.  Phase II completes the detailed design, fabricates two prototype units, and performs operational environment testing (e.g., temperature, shock, vibration, g-loading) to advance the design to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL-) 5 stage.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To address the challenges posed by operating in accordance with complex federal acquisition regulations that discourage nontraditional providers from partnering with the government in emerging markets, ARiA LLC, a research-and-development firm that develops machine-learning and cognitive-computing software for commercial and government use, in collaboration with CPJ, a nonprofit nonpartisan civic-education and public-policy-research organization with unique expertise in translating government acquisition requirements for nontraditional providers, will develop the scientific and technical foundation for, develop the public-adoption strategy for, and demonstrate the feasibility of MICA, the Machine Interface for Contracting Assistance. MICA is a natural-language query system, reasoning engine, and recommendation system that leverages commercial-sector advances in cognitive-computing algorithms including IBM Watson cloud services, deep learning, and semantic web, to provide users from both government and current and prospective contractor organizations insight and clarification into what is required of them by defense-contracting statutes, regulations, practices, and policies. Beyond providing a clear, intuitive, and comprehensive natural-language query interface to defense-contracting statutes, regulations, practices, and policies, MICA leverages its semantic database of government requirements together with its advanced reasoning and machine-learning capabilities to automatically determine requirements for solicitations and provides those requirements to potential offerors in a clear natural-language format that supports drill-down.BENEFIT:The MICA cognitive-computing system to be developed and evaluated in this work will advance the state-of-the-art to significantly enhance the ability of small and innovative companies to partner with DoD in emerging areas of research. The Phase I effort will (1) develop a design architectural concept and early stage prototype for MICA, (2) demonstrate that MICA can feasibly be developed into a cognitive computing system that meets Air Force, DoD, and contractor needs, and (3) establish that MICA can be feasibly developed into a cognitive-computing application deployable on web-based platforms during Phase II and as a mobile app able to support all defense-acquisition-process phases and milestones during Phase III. This Phase III transition will be supported by a comprehensive rollout plan developed in coordination with CPJ, including marketing and training for prospective offerors and government officials. MICAs capability for automated generation of requirements associated with specific solicitations naturally extends to automated specification of required offeror capabilities, which further increases accessibility to nontraditional defense contractors and aligns with the continuing Department of Defense transformation to a capabilities based, net-centric acquisition approach. The natural-language query system, reasoning engine, and recommendation system we propose to develop and evaluate will significantly enhance the contracting process for new or nontraditional offerors across federal, state, and local government-contracting processes. It is aligned with open-government initiatives to enhance the acquisition process. Our solution is supported by large private foundations that seek to maximize return on their investment by aligning the work of their grantees with federal and state opportunities."

        "abstract": "To address the need for enhanced Doppler processing to improve the performance of pulsed continuous-wave (CW) waveform processing in the presence of stationary clutter, own-ship induced clutter, and active interference, Applied Research in Acoustics LLC (ARiA) will develop and demonstrate the feasibility of signal- and information-processing algorithms for mitigation of Doppler clutter. ARiA will develop and evaluate (1) a subarray\/subspace robust adaptive beamformer (ABF) mitigation of motion-induced Doppler spreading, (2) a novel model-based space-time processor for mitigation of motion-induced Doppler spreading based on a more complete physical model of the physical and signal-processing sources of Doppler clutter, and (3) a robust compressive-sensing beamformer (CSBF) for active-interference mitigation. The Phase I effort will (1) develop Doppler-clutter-mitigation (DCM) processing that will improve the performance of Doppler processing in the presence of stationary clutter, ownship-induced clutter, and active interference; (2) demonstrate that DCM processing can feasibly meet Navy needs by improving the probability of detection and correct classification and reducing false-alert rate (FAR) and operator work load; and (3) establish that DCM processing can be developed into a useful product for the Navy that is compatible with existing hardware (e.g., the AN\/SQS-53C) and software architectures (e.g., the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15, BFFS, and MFAFS)."

For the antenna subsystem, ASI will leverage its RF propagation and antenna design know-how to complete: an analysis of suitable antennas, including computer simulation results from 100MHz to 18 GHz of the antennas positioned on a CAD model of ScanEagle; antenna selection for the Phase II development based on that analysis; and, a detailed calibration strategy to deliver accurate spectrum measurements over 360 degrees of azimuthal angle from the antenna subsystem. For the RF and digital processing electronics subsystems, ASI will complete a survey of new, commercially available, small form factor spectrum analyzers and front ends. These will be compared with ASIs recent developments using COTS processors and ADC cards with custom RF front ends. Component selection and system description based on the survey and analysis will be delivered. ASI will develop a product definition that ensures integration with meteorological functions, LIDAR payloads and ScanEagle."

Two longwave infrared (LWIR) spectral bands will be imaged in alternate frames by using a readout multiplexer that flips the voltage bias across the FPA from frame to frame.  In Phase I, we will re-design the basic LWIR SLS photodiode to significantly increase quantum efficiency over the current state-of-the-art while minimizing dark current.  Phase II will use this breakthrough to develop a longwave\/longwave dualband infrared FPA with the high quantum efficiency and low spectral crosstalk.  We will also engage with a Systems Prime in Phase II to package the FPA for a systems level test following Phase II.  Approved for Public Release 14-MDA-8047 (14 Nov 14)"

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Leviathan Security Group (LSG) has previously created a system called Major Myer, under the DARPA CINDER program, which is capable of detecting exploitation attempts in images of application memory using emulation. It has focused on crashdumps, but is theoretically not limited to this purpose. LSG has since commercialized the technology developed under that project into a product called Lotan, which is currently offered for sale as a detector for exploit code in crashdumps collected through existing error reporting facilities. However, the solution is fundamentally reactive in nature, since it can only detect exploits after they have reached the target system. LSG now proposes to extend this methodology to filter files, at the point of network ingress and any other point designated by network administrators, in order to apply this technology in a proactive manner and shift the asymmetry further in favour of the defender. Like Major Myer and Lotan, the technology will rely on behavioural heuristics and inactive emulation, rather than the traditional technique of explicit signatures and sandboxes. Research work on the project will include generalization of the Lotan technology, construction of exploitation context required for detection, result presentation, and domain-specific security hardening.; BENEFIT: The chief benefit of this project will be the ability to detect malicious files per se, without a need for signatures, at the point of network ingress. For example, email attachments and file downloads could be filtered. Later stages of the project will improve the filtering speed and harden the security of the filter. The method used is capable of detecting previously unknown (0-day) remote code execution exploits, provided they use at least some known technique. As a modular addition to a commercial project, the commercialization potential of the results of this project are clear and strong; products with similar use cases have been successful in the marketplace and file scanners in general are viewed as a critical component in network defense."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force desires more accurate and more robust navigation for their intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and cruise missiles (CM) which must navigate entirely using the on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU) without an external aiding scheme.  Team ATA proposes to develop a new set of algorithms aimed at the Quantification of Uncertainty for Advanced Dead Reckoning Algorithms (QUADRA).  These next generation missile navigation algorithms will provide improved dead reckoning accuracy without external aiding using the navigation and guidance systems.  The first part of the QUADRA algorithms is to replace the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).  QUADRA will produce a filtering algorithm that uses a computationally scalable method of propagating non-Gaussian uncertainty distributions through nonlinear dynamics to efficiently determine the missiles navigation solution for position and attitude.  BENEFIT:  There are numerous anticipated benefits to Team ATAs Quantification of Uncertainty for Advanced Dead Reckoning Algorithms (QUADRA).  Our new filtering solution will provide better filtering accuracy than the traditional EKF while maintaining computational tractability.  Our scalable and computationally efficient algorithms for both constrained and flexible computing resources enable the algorithm to apply to more types of IMU-based navigation solutions.    ATA has been developing technology for the U.S. Government and Aerospace contractors since 1975.  ATAs success in generating additional revenue tied to our Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects has allowed ATA to grow and expand its business through Phase III commercialization and other spin-off contracts.  As reported in the ATA Company Commercialization Report, we have received 48 Phase I SBIR awards and 21 Phase II awards.  ATAs track record for commercialization of SBIR sponsored technology is excellent, resulting in a Commercialization Achievement Index of 95 and related cumulative revenues from sales and additional investments of over $42 million.    Team ATAs approach to commercializing QUADRA starts with additional engineering services contracts where Team ATA can provide inertial navigation expertise to existing and new government customers and industry primes.  Team ATA will immediately be better positioned for more engineering service opportunities with the Phase I award.  Additional funding beyond Phase I is critical to realizing IMU\/IRU system sales to industry primes by integrating our high performing, low-cost hardware solutions with our QUADRA algorithms to improve navigation accuracy and responsiveness.  In addition to a potential Phase II, we will leverage internal investment dollars and other commercial investment dollars through links with industry."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The space environment is rapidly becoming more contested as new countries become space capable and traditional space entities continue to push the envelope.  The evolving tactical nature of space has driven the need for real-time Threat Indications and Notifications (TIN).  ATA is proposing Launch Assessment Threat Indications and Notifications for SSA (LATIN for SSA) to address TIN requirements.  LATIN for SSA has identified non-traditional products not currently used for SSA launch TIN that will be beneficial in providing indications, threat notifications and launch event track custody if correlated and broadcast in a real-time manner.  LATIN for SSA will develop a real-time correlation engine to fuse non-traditional SSA data products and make tactical inferences based on the correlation of that data.  The LATIN for SSA capability will maintain custody of a launch event in and out of SSN coverage areas and determine when re-tasking of the SSN is required.  BENEFIT:  There are numerous anticipated benefits to ATAs Launch Assessment Threat Indications and Notifications for SSA (LATIN for SSA).  Real-time evaluation of event tasking and actual even observables provides indicators as the whether or not pre-launch tasking will sufficiently support event.

ATAs approach to commercializing LATIN for SSA is to work the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to mature this effort and deploy LATIN for SSA within the ARCADE JMS suites.  In coordination with SMC, AFRL has developed the ARCADE environment to assist and mature SSA applications.  Within this environment, applications and application providers have the ability to mature their capabilities with operational data within standalone environments and on live operational networks Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), and JWICS.  ATA will follow the AFRL and SMC ARCADE process for capability maturation and transition."

Since multiple data streams feed the system, the target tracking needs to be performed in a framework of multi-sensor filtering.  This framework also needs to be able to handle the post breakup multi-target problem.  The objective is new approaches for multi-target, multi-sensor data fusion and event reconstruction that provide the means necessary to inform battle management on a real-time basis of off-nominal target breakup events.

        "abstract": "The team of ATA and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) will design and fabricate a novel Tactical MEMS Accelerometer and Gyro (TMAG) as the basis of a high-end tactical grade IMU.  TMAG will incorporate a novel design that is both a single-axis yaw gyroscope and single-axis accelerometer with a size of 5 x 5 mm.  Three TMAGs can then be aligned orthogonally to make a 6-axis IMU.  The IMU would be less than 1 in^3, consume an order of magnitude less power, be 2-3 times more sensitive and have higher mechanical stiffness and bandwidth than state-of-the-art tactical IMUs such as the HG1700 and LN200.  All of this is possible give the recent large advances SNL has recently made in micromachined MEMS that have once again made the MEMS vibratory gyroscope a competitive solution for ultra-small SWaP tactical grade IMUs.  Moreover, SNL has simultaneously developed and refined a state-of-the-art displacement sensing unit which provides orders of magnitude better displacement sensitivity than any competing method when size is constrained.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The Air Force is seeking a software tool that can aid ISR mission planners in ensuring that essential elements of information (EEIs) extracted from sensor data at stages throughout the data fusion process are of a satisfactory quality. This tool will must be responsible for appropriately configuring compression algorithm settings across multiple modalities, including electro-optic, infrared, SAR, hyperspectral, and LIDAR. A successful effort will develop a tool that supports analyst feedback to establish trust in compression settings, as well as metrics for EEI satisfaction. ATA is developing a software compression settings broker (SCSB) that will close the loop between mission planners, sensor modality specific data requirements, compression algorithms, and analysts determining EEI satisfaction. To accelerate this process and ensure operational relevance, ATA is teaming with General Atomics and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, two leaders in operational data retrieval and fusion technology. ATA provides expertise in modality tailored compression, in particular for full motion video and hyperspectral data, and in-house H.264 compression software and distortion analysis tools. In the first phase of this program, we will focus on level 1 of the data fusion model, particularly as it pertains to electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery.BENEFIT:ATAs SCSB data compression\/utilization solution can be run on a desktop computer, which greatly enhances commercial viability. Additional product offerings could include developing settings mappings for specific algorithms, sensors, or missions. Once the settings broker has shown to have value as tool for mission planners, AFSOC and other intelligence community users are likely to have strong interest. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proliferating at remarkable rates over the last decade and will continue, so the ability to maximize data utility for mission planners will be highly sought. ATA has been developing technology for the U.S. Government and Aerospace contractors since 1975. During this time, we have developed outstanding relationships that we will leverage to bring the SCSB technology to market. ATAs success in generating additional revenue tied to our Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects has allowed ATA to grow and expand its business through Phase III commercialization and other spin-off contracts. As reported in the ATA Company Commercialization Report, we have received 54 Phase I SBIR awards and 22 Phase II awards. ATAs track record for commercialization of SBIR sponsored technology is excellent, resulting in a Commercialization Achievement Index of 95 and related cumulative revenues from sales and additional investments of over $42 million."

        "abstract": "This research effort will develop a Cognitive Radio (CR) architecture to include spectral sensing and adaptive radio communications. Spectral sensing algorithms use a filter bank approach with wavelet-based spectral band edge detection to detect existing communication channels and spectral white space. Cyclostationary techniques are used for modulation recognition of existing communication channels. Adaptive communication techniques leverage the results of spectral sensing to exploit existing communication channels using burst QPSK waveforms and spectral white space using direct filter bank synthesis enabling robust communications even in dynamic spectral environments that include interference and multipath. Algorithms will be benchmarked in simulated communications environments using MATLAB, and prototyped in the REDHAWK Software Communications Architecture (SCA) framework. Prototyping in REDHAWK enables a straightforward migration path to COTS Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms including our own wideband multi-channel SDR products. The use of multi-channel radios enables the exploitation of spatial diversity for improved performance in both spectral sensing and adaptive MIMO communications. This research has immediate direct impact to current tactical communication needs, but also provides a solution for many commercial market needs including TV white space exploitation, higher utilization of cellular bands, and as an adaptive wireless communication bridge (cross-banding between various wireless protocols)."

The proposed component is expected to have an energy density of 2.8 J\/cm3, a capacitance of 5nF, and be able to operate at 80,000V. The proposed capacitor will handle pulsed currents in excess of 2000A for tens of nanoseconds all while being cycled at 1 MHz. This component will hold to a C0G temperature specification, and is expected to behave linearly over the operating voltage range. This new component will enable a plethora of new pulsed power applications by reducing size, and weight, and by increasing power density over conventional designs."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In an era of reduced Defense budgets and increasing threats, military planners are seeking new technologies to reduce operating costs and increase operation capabilities for space and aviation platforms, and weight reduction is an attractive target. For example, transportation costs to geosynchronous orbits using a NASA reusable launch vehicle are close to $10,000 per pound of payload. Copper wiring, which makes up as much as one-third of the weight of a 15-ton satellite and 20 miles of an F-22 aircraft, is a clear target for weight reduction. Half of this wire weight is typically in the EMI shielding. Developing new lightweight, conductive materials that replace copper in the shielding and core conductor could serve as a lead candidate for radically reducing this weight. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) combine high strength, electrical and thermal conductivity with low density, which makes them ideal for applications where weight reduction is a priority. DexMat is commercializing CNT technology that has shown the highest published values for conductivity and mechanical strength of CNT materials. This Phase I Proposal will examine the feasibility of developing CNT-based cables with solution-processing technology capable of producing high performance CNT fibers and coatings, without the use of binders and wetting agents.BENEFIT:The potential benefits of this innovation could include military development for future ground, air or space systems that have stringent weight requirements, including launch vehicles, UAVs, portable communications,small satellites,etc. Commercial Application: Any commercial development for electronic-heavy systems with stringent weight requirements, including jetliners, satellites, small computers, etc."
